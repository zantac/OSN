When a British officer is about to be sent to Sudan to fight a war he doesn't approve of, he is seen as a coward. He has to resign his post, right before his regiment ships out to battle the rebels, and to make things even worse for him, he receives four white feathers from his friends and his fiancée. These feathers symbolize how they feel about him, they see him as a coward, but what they don't know is that he plans to go to Sudan anyway, undercover, so he can save his friends from a certain death and redeem his honor...\n\nThe story certainly is interesting and offers an interesting approach to a story that has been told many times before.

I'm not saying that the part of the movie showing England isn't any good, but I'm not too much a fan of those Victorian costumes and habits. I prefer the dust and dirt from the desert and the battles in which good manors only come later and the true human nature gets the upper hand.\n\nEven though many people seem to hate this movie, I can't join them in their opinion. All actors did a nice job and even though it is perhaps true that they could have found a better actress than Kate Hudson to play the role of Ethne, it never bothered me in such a way that it spoiled all the rest of my fun. And about the historical accuracy I can be brief as well. It looked good enough to me to be believable. Perhaps there were some minor details that weren't right, but since I'm not too familiar with the time period shown in this movie, I certainly didn't notice them. Anyway, I liked what I saw and even though many people gave it a bad review, I certainly liked it for what it was: A very decent movie about honor, freedom, friendship,...

I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.\n\nStand by Me is about 4 pre-teen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. They've obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face, where they are no longer kids, but just about to become adults. When their friend, Vern, tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid's body is, the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though, there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first, it's a matter of who will reach it first. But of course, it's the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.\n\nThese are some of the best characters I have seen on film, we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother, his idol, in a car crash recently and can't get any love or respect from his father and it's obvious that he gets it from his friends. That's what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy's best friend, he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere, he's the kid who you knew in school and just knew he'd turn out bad, but there's a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who's been disappointed so many times by an adult.\n\nTeddy is another bad kid sort of speak, he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper, but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then there's Vern, the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything, and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still, Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other's appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.\n\nThe acting is just phenomenal. Now, the directing, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits, he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get pre-teen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. That's what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.\n\n10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":371140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Walsh, the director of Jump.\n\nThe film is set in the summer of 1998 during the Tour de France, which takes place in Ireland that year. The Belgian cyclist Dominique Chabol (Louis Talpe) is at the end of his sports career, but secretly hopes to be able to wear the yellow jersey. When Dominique offers less good speed records, he is kicked out of his team. Thus he loses hope of making his dream come true and prepares to leave his sports career behind. When another member of his old team is disqualified due to a doping error, Dominique gets his last chance to make his dream come true.\n\nThis film comes across as if you are looking at real images of the Tour de France with additional images of how the cyclists prepare for their races. The film is so entertaining and informative for cycling fans. You get a good view of what heavy things cyclists do to have a chance of winning a cycling race. In this way you also see how false it is when other cyclists use doping to win their races in an unfair way.\n\nA downside of this film is that you mainly follow the main character when he is kicked out of his cycling team, looking for a new way of life. He tries to improve his family life and to start a relationship with the doctor who cared for him. When he is allowed to return to his team towards the end of the film, he seems to be occupied with his own sports career and dreams again. The time you, as a viewer, spend after his sports career together with the main character, then appears somewhat aimless.\n\nThe acting is well done by the cast. Louis Talpe comes across well as a cyclist who chooses his career. It's just a shame that his character comes across a bit too selfish when he is allowed to return to his team. The rest of the cast gets a chance to shine as they help the main character with his life after his career. If he does choose his career again in the end, the time you spent with the rest of the cast also seems a bit unnecessary.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":692,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Walsh, the director of Jump.\n\nThe film is set in the summer of 1998 during the Tour de France, which takes place in Ireland that year. The Belgian cyclist Dominique Chabol (Louis Talpe) is at the end of his sports career, but secretly hopes to be able to wear the yellow jersey. When Dominique offers less good speed records, he is kicked out of his team. Thus he loses hope of making his dream come true and prepares to leave his sports career behind. When another member of his old team is disqualified due to a doping error, Dominique gets his last chance to make his dream come true.\n\nThis film comes across as if you are looking at real images of the Tour de France with additional images of how the cyclists prepare for their races. The film is so entertaining and informative for cycling fans. You get a good view of what heavy things cyclists do to have a chance of winning a cycling race. In this way you also see how false it is when other cyclists use doping to win their races in an unfair way.\n\nA downside of this film is that you mainly follow the main character when he is kicked out of his cycling team, looking for a new way of life. He tries to improve his family life and to start a relationship with the doctor who cared for him. When he is allowed to return to his team towards the end of the film, he seems to be occupied with his own sports career and dreams again. The time you, as a viewer, spend after his sports career together with the main character, then appears somewhat aimless.\n\nThe acting is well done by the cast. Louis Talpe comes across well as a cyclist who chooses his career. It's just a shame that his character comes across a bit too selfish when he is allowed to return to his team. The rest of the cast gets a chance to shine as they help the main character with his life after his career. If he does choose his career again in the end, the time you spent with the rest of the cast also seems a bit unnecessary.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":692,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I think the reason I love this film so much is because, everyone in some way could relate to it. When you're a pre-teen and have a close group of friends and face something so intense together, there's that special bond that no matter how much you loose touch with each other, one day, you just think of them and that one incident.\n\nStand by Me is about 4 pre-teen boys whose summer is about to end and they are about to start junior high. They've obviously grown up together and are nervous of the world they are about to face, where they are no longer kids, but just about to become adults. When their friend, Vern, tells them about a kid their age that is missing that he found out by listening in on his brother where the kid's body is, the boys think it would be so cool to find the body and become the local town heroes. They have one problem though, there are these big tough guys who want to find the body first, it's a matter of who will reach it first. But of course, it's the bonding of the boys that really gets you into the film.\n\nThese are some of the best characters I have seen on film, we start with Gordy. Gordy is an intelligent writer who lost his big brother, his idol, in a car crash recently and can't get any love or respect from his father and it's obvious that he gets it from his friends. That's what keeps him going. Chris is the leader of the gang and Gordy's best friend, he comes from a very bad family and is dubbed the bad seed everywhere, he's the kid who you knew in school and just knew he'd turn out bad, but there's a deeper side to him. The speech that River Phoenix turned out for Chris was so beautifully dilvered as a child who's been disappointed so many times by an adult.\n\nTeddy is another bad kid sort of speak, he has a bad home life where his father is crazy and nearly killed him a few times. He has a quick temper, but you can tell that his friends keep him down to Earth and help him through the worst times. Then there's Vern, the funny fat kid who is pretty much scarred of everything, and in some ways is the 4th wheel. Still, Vern you can tell is a great friend and the other's appreciate him despite how he can hold them back.\n\nThe acting is just phenomenal. Now, the directing, Rob Reiner is without a doubt one of the best directors of all time, he took these young boys and pushed them to their limits, he was so smart about it as well. He said in an interview that he had to get pre-teen boys who were close to the personality of the character in the film, so it would come natural to the pre-teen actors, and you could tell that this film was his baby, he put so much thought and love into this film. That's what makes this film so special, nothing could ever compete with a coming of age film like Stand By Me.\n\n10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":371140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Streep has been on top for some time now and Hoffman has an unmatched resume of fine performances over the past five years. Pairing off as adversaries in John Patrick Shanley's stage play brought to screen they parry and prod throughout with each landing hay makers along the way.\n\nChange is in the wind in 1964 for both the world and the Catholic Church (Second Vatican Council) as the country moves from conservatism to liberal thought. Sister Aloysius (Streep)is the principal of an inner city Catholic school who rules with an iron fist. Lamenting the loss of tradition (she thinks Frosty the Snowman is a song about worshiping false idols) she crosses swords with the popular and laid back Father Flynn who takes a more liberal view seeing the need to keep up with the times. His progressive ways gnaw at Sister Aloysius and she is soon suspecting Father Flynn of inappropriate relationship with altar boys even though she is without concrete proof.\n\nThe scenes between Streep and Hoffman are riveting from start to finish. Both attempt at first to be civil with each other but eventually they end up at each others throat bullying and threatening. It is a titanic emotional struggle that makes for a gripping drama flawlessly acted. I'm no big fan of Streep, finding the adopted accents she employs in some of her films false and hollow, but as the self righteous Nunzilla her pugnacious style and inflection rates with her Sophie's Choice performance. Hoffman has his work cut out for him to keep up with the formidable legend but he holds his own with equal footing.\n\nIn supporting roles Amy Adams is very effective as the unintended go between Sister James. Seized with doubt she like the audience mirrors our own misgivings as conflicted objective observers. Viola Davis as a troubled boy's mother has one lengthy powerful and painful scene that begins to tie loose ends together but offers no easy solution.\n\nWriter director John Patrick Shanley does an admirable job in keeping the plot nebulous with ambivalent scenes and peripheral characters that purposefully enhance the suspense. Scenes are tightly edited with sparse but effective dialog giving the film its steady pace. Other than some jarring oblique angle shots the camera compositions and set design provide a somber ambiance for the drama and an arena for the perfectly measured performances by two masters of the craft in this fight to the finish that remains absorbing from beginning to end.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":123773,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Streep has been on top for some time now and Hoffman has an unmatched resume of fine performances over the past five years. Pairing off as adversaries in John Patrick Shanley's stage play brought to screen they parry and prod throughout with each landing hay makers along the way.\n\nChange is in the wind in 1964 for both the world and the Catholic Church (Second Vatican Council) as the country moves from conservatism to liberal thought. Sister Aloysius (Streep)is the principal of an inner city Catholic school who rules with an iron fist. Lamenting the loss of tradition (she thinks Frosty the Snowman is a song about worshiping false idols) she crosses swords with the popular and laid back Father Flynn who takes a more liberal view seeing the need to keep up with the times. His progressive ways gnaw at Sister Aloysius and she is soon suspecting Father Flynn of inappropriate relationship with altar boys even though she is without concrete proof.\n\nThe scenes between Streep and Hoffman are riveting from start to finish. Both attempt at first to be civil with each other but eventually they end up at each others throat bullying and threatening. It is a titanic emotional struggle that makes for a gripping drama flawlessly acted. I'm no big fan of Streep, finding the adopted accents she employs in some of her films false and hollow, but as the self righteous Nunzilla her pugnacious style and inflection rates with her Sophie's Choice performance. Hoffman has his work cut out for him to keep up with the formidable legend but he holds his own with equal footing.\n\nIn supporting roles Amy Adams is very effective as the unintended go between Sister James. Seized with doubt she like the audience mirrors our own misgivings as conflicted objective observers. Viola Davis as a troubled boy's mother has one lengthy powerful and painful scene that begins to tie loose ends together but offers no easy solution.\n\nWriter director John Patrick Shanley does an admirable job in keeping the plot nebulous with ambivalent scenes and peripheral characters that purposefully enhance the suspense. Scenes are tightly edited with sparse but effective dialog giving the film its steady pace. Other than some jarring oblique angle shots the camera compositions and set design provide a somber ambiance for the drama and an arena for the perfectly measured performances by two masters of the craft in this fight to the finish that remains absorbing from beginning to end.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":123773,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Walsh, the director of Jump.\n\nThe film is set in the summer of 1998 during the Tour de France, which takes place in Ireland that year. The Belgian cyclist Dominique Chabol (Louis Talpe) is at the end of his sports career, but secretly hopes to be able to wear the yellow jersey. When Dominique offers less good speed records, he is kicked out of his team. Thus he loses hope of making his dream come true and prepares to leave his sports career behind. When another member of his old team is disqualified due to a doping error, Dominique gets his last chance to make his dream come true.\n\nThis film comes across as if you are looking at real images of the Tour de France with additional images of how the cyclists prepare for their races. The film is so entertaining and informative for cycling fans. You get a good view of what heavy things cyclists do to have a chance of winning a cycling race. In this way you also see how false it is when other cyclists use doping to win their races in an unfair way.\n\nA downside of this film is that you mainly follow the main character when he is kicked out of his cycling team, looking for a new way of life. He tries to improve his family life and to start a relationship with the doctor who cared for him. When he is allowed to return to his team towards the end of the film, he seems to be occupied with his own sports career and dreams again. The time you, as a viewer, spend after his sports career together with the main character, then appears somewhat aimless.\n\nThe acting is well done by the cast. Louis Talpe comes across well as a cyclist who chooses his career. It's just a shame that his character comes across a bit too selfish when he is allowed to return to his team. The rest of the cast gets a chance to shine as they help the main character with his life after his career. If he does choose his career again in the end, the time you spent with the rest of the cast also seems a bit unnecessary.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":692,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Rat (Eric Idle) rows him up the river to see Toad (Terry Jones). Toad tells them that he sold Mole's home to the Weasels. In exchange, Toad gives Mole a caravan. Toad gets run off the road by a wild motorcar. Toad becomes obsessed with motorcar. After six motorcars, Toad puts Toad Hall at risk. Badger is a friend of Toad's father and tries to stop Toad from driving. Toad is helpless in the face of the Weasels' schemes.\n\nThis works better as Monty Python fare more than a children's movie. Kids would probably be bored with the muted colors and weird middle-aged men playing these cartoon characters. The courtroom scene works the best with a lot of wacky fun. The material is probably not the best for the guys to adapt but fans may find it irreverent fun.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There are plenty of twists and surprises, and the film leaves the viewers with some important messages/themes to ponder over. It is best to go into the movie knowing as little about the story as possible, and let it take you on its journey.\n\nThis film will greatly reward repeat viewings. The attention to detail in every frame is incredible, and there is always so much on the screen to absorb and process, in the best way possible. I believe that Wes Anderson has the most distinct and easily discernible style of any filmmaker to ever live, and this quality alone is something to be praised very highly.\n\nIf you love dogs, Japanese cinema/culture, stop-motion, and animation in general, then you will love this film all the more so.

It really feels more like a stylish TV commercial or an atmospheric music video, but all those style doesn't contribute much to the characters or their drama.\n\nI would rather have preferred it if the director dropped his pretentious ambition and shrunk the film to, say, a 15 min short, really focusing on the intense human drama itself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":232,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I mean, I certainly enjoyed it, but I just wasn't too sure of how I felt about the film as a whole.  I must say that this film was MUCH better the second time around.  And just got better with each additional viewing. I am a huge Robert Zemeckis fan, so maybe my expectations were slightly skewed at first.  But, all in all, I've watched the film enough times now that I can say "I love this film!!!"\n\nWhen I really stop and think about it, the film is brilliantly executed. The scenery is absolutely breath taking, the special effects are so well done that you don't even realize that there are special effects present. This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis (case and point, "Forrest Gump").  The acting is very good, although, there's only 2 real sources of acting in this film, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.  The rest of the cast was good, but their roles were very minor.  Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance, as usual.  You really can feel all of his emotions while he's stuck on the island.  Also, not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film, I truly applaud him for his work.  As much as I liked Russell Crow in "Gladiator", I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more (although that would be his third Oscar).  Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance.  There is also a good deal of comedy in the film, and it is done very well.\n\nThis is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch.  There aren't a great many films that I would say this, but this one I would. Although...if you aren't a fan of Tom Hanks, then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island.  So, if that is the case, then you are off the hook.  So, I hope you watch the film, and I hope that you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,\n\n-Chris","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":538701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H23M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The scenery is absolutely breath taking, the special effects are so well done that you don't even realize that there are special effects present. This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis (case and point, "Forrest Gump").  The acting is very good, although, there's only 2 real sources of acting in this film, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.  The rest of the cast was good, but their roles were very minor.  Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance, as usual.  You really can feel all of his emotions while he's stuck on the island.  Also, not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film, I truly applaud him for his work.  As much as I liked Russell Crow in "Gladiator", I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more (although that would be his third Oscar).  Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance.  There is also a good deal of comedy in the film, and it is done very well.\n\nThis is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch.  There aren't a great many films that I would say this, but this one I would. Although...if you aren't a fan of Tom Hanks, then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island.  So, if that is the case, then you are off the hook.  So, I hope you watch the film, and I hope that you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,\n\n-Chris","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":538701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"duration":"PT2H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A series that has certainly seen better days. Last Blood's title infers a finale that could wrap the decades old series in a nice little bow and call back to the film that started it all. However, it fails to truly honor its hero in a satisfying way.\n\nThe first film First Blood seems so tamed compared to this newest entry and looking back the series as a whole has changed along the way. First Blood was a film based on the novel of the same name that followed a man struggling to reenter society after the Vietnam War. It was a topical film showcasing the cruelty and disgust many of our veterans received upon returning home. First Blood was a film with scenes of violence, but it was not an action film. It was as far as I can see an anti war film. Every film after this has failed to understand what this film was about and has opted for a more action heavy series and a violent one at that.\n\nLast Blood is First Blood's polar opposite. It relishes in its violence especially in the 3rd act, but at least in this film the reason and motive is clear and can be understood. Last Blood is not concerned with telling the story of a man haunted by war or telling an anti war story. Its focus is on violent revenge and I have to look at it this way. The Rambo series has transformed itself into something completely different from the first film. So, does this work as a revenge thriller?\n\nI would say yes in the most simplistic sense. This is the story of a man who wants to live his final years in peace but is called to action once again to protect someone he loves. It's a story we know all too well. However, it has proved an emotionally resonant story in the past. Rambo's story in this film and his goal is simple and it's simple to a fault, but this film is not concerned with its story as much as it is the action this series has become known for.\n\nLet's talk about the action. I won't lie it's fun. The third act is insane and over the top and indulges in grotesque violence that will bring out the cave man in all of us. This would be fine, other Stallone movies have indulged in violence before and that's the main selling point. His Expendibles trilogy is a great example, but Last Blood tries for something more and lays the seeds for what should be an emotional crescendo for our John Rambo, but the film doesn't do enough to make this satisfying and so the film ends up feeling unbalanced.\n\nRambo's relationship with his niece is the heart of the film and helps in at least giving an emotional connection the film sorely needs. However, these are about the only characters that have any form of depth. The villains are 1 dimensional and nothing more and are there simply to be part of an endless army for Rambo to mutilate and maim in glorious over the top violence which is fun. The film however has a saving grace in the form of Stallone and his performance. Stallone has always been an underrated actor and I believe it hasn't been until recently that he's been receiving some of the recognition he deserves.\n\nThe movies problems perhaps are a result of its extremely short length. If anyone knows about the making of this film it was constantly cut down in the editing room to make it 89 minutes, the shortest Rambo film to date. I believe in a longer version of this film lies a film that is much better, that balances out its more meditative moments with its bursts of violence.\n\nAs it stands the film feels unbalanced and has an extremely slow and boring first two acts that ends on an action packed finale and the the final moments of the film feel like they should be more impactful than they end up being. These last few moments are the best parts of the film and make it feel more like a finale. Perhaps an extended version of the film could be released to fix many of these films short comings, but we'll have to wait and see.\n\nOverall, Rambo: Last Blood is a film that has the right stuff to make this finale great, but what is there is either not enough or cut down to reach a certain runtime. Stallone's performance makes it at least worth a watch as it tries it's best to blend the series violent aspects with the more character driven first film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I mean, I certainly enjoyed it, but I just wasn't too sure of how I felt about the film as a whole.  I must say that this film was MUCH better the second time around.  And just got better with each additional viewing. I am a huge Robert Zemeckis fan, so maybe my expectations were slightly skewed at first.  But, all in all, I've watched the film enough times now that I can say "I love this film!!!"\n\nWhen I really stop and think about it, the film is brilliantly executed. The scenery is absolutely breath taking, the special effects are so well done that you don't even realize that there are special effects present. This seems to be a trademark of Robert Zemeckis (case and point, "Forrest Gump").  The acting is very good, although, there's only 2 real sources of acting in this film, Tom Hanks and Helen Hunt.  The rest of the cast was good, but their roles were very minor.  Tom Hanks pulls off another great performance, as usual.  You really can feel all of his emotions while he's stuck on the island.  Also, not many actors have changed their physical appearance like Tom Hanks did for this film, I truly applaud him for his work.  As much as I liked Russell Crow in "Gladiator", I firmly believe that Tom Hanks deserved it more (although that would be his third Oscar).  Helen Hunt also pulls off a very nice performance.  There is also a good deal of comedy in the film, and it is done very well.\n\nThis is one of the few films that I strongly recommend you watch.  There aren't a great many films that I would say this, but this one I would. Although...if you aren't a fan of Tom Hanks, then you might have some trouble with this film because a great deal of the film is him alone on an island.  So, if that is the case, then you are off the hook.  So, I hope you watch the film, and I hope that you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,\n\n-Chris","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":538701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"duration":"PT2H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">Agent jednostki Impossible Missions Force, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), postanawia zmienić swoje życie i wreszcie się ustatkować. W dniu zaręczyn z Julią (Michelle Monaghan) dostaje jednak wiadomość o zaginięciu funkcjonariuszki Lindsey Farris (Kerri Russell). W tajemnicy przed narzeczoną Ethan podejmuje się misji ratunkowej. Okazuje się, że Lindsey została porwana przez handlarza bronią OwenaDaviana (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Wydaje się, że operacja tajnego agenta ma szansę powodzenia. Rzeczywiście, Huntowi szybko udaje się znaleźć i odbić Farris. Wkrótce dochodzi jednak do tragedii. Przestępcy wszczepili bowiem w głowę kobiety ładunek wybuchowy. Uwolniona agentka ginie na skutek jego eksplozji. Hunt rusza do Watykanu, gdzie ma przejąć broń chemiczną, a także schwytać przebywającego tam Daviana, odpowiedzialnego za śmierć Lindsey. Udaje mu się aresztować gangstera, lecz jego sukces jest krótkotrwały. W drodze do Ameryki przebiegły handlarz zostaje uwolniony przez swoich ludzi. Wkrótce porywa Julię. W zamian za darowanie jej życia żąda, aby Hunt wykradł dla niego potężną broń. Atutem brawurowo zrealizowanego filmu są znakomite efekty specjalne.</desc>

Ranging from an external view of the gigantic Event Horizon around Neptune to Dr. Weir and his 'HANDywork' with his eyes.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a good but underrated sci-fi horror movie with lots of freaky moments that will keep your heart racing. If you like the depressing endless terror, you'll like this movie quite a bit. If you rather have happy endings and laughs, you'll probably dislike it.\n\nFor the best experience, watch this movie in a dark room at night or even past midnight with the volume turned up a bit over the normal setting.\n\nRated 7/10 on IMDb, but I personally would give it a 7.5/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163325,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Mission: Impossible</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Agent jednostki Impossible Missions Force, Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise), postanawia zmienić swoje życie i wreszcie się ustatkować. W dniu zaręczyn z Julią (Michelle Monaghan) dostaje jednak wiadomość o zaginięciu funkcjonariuszki Lindsey Farris (Kerri Russell). W tajemnicy przed narzeczoną Ethan podejmuje się misji ratunkowej. Okazuje się, że Lindsey została porwana przez handlarza bronią OwenaDaviana (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Wydaje się, że operacja tajnego agenta ma szansę powodzenia. Rzeczywiście, Huntowi szybko udaje się znaleźć i odbić Farris. Wkrótce dochodzi jednak do tragedii. Przestępcy wszczepili bowiem w głowę kobiety ładunek wybuchowy. Uwolniona agentka ginie na skutek jego eksplozji. Hunt rusza do Watykanu, gdzie ma przejąć broń chemiczną, a także schwytać przebywającego tam Daviana, odpowiedzialnego za śmierć Lindsey. Udaje mu się aresztować gangstera, lecz jego sukces jest krótkotrwały. W drodze do Ameryki przebiegły handlarz zostaje uwolniony przez swoich ludzi. Wkrótce porywa Julię. W zamian za darowanie jej życia żąda, aby Hunt wykradł dla niego potężną broń. Atutem brawurowo zrealizowanego filmu są znakomite efekty specjalne.</desc>

And, overall, I liked it.\n\nI never watched "Angel" so I have no problem with seeing David Boreanaz in this new role. I thought he was a very good choice for the part. I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning. I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints". The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And, overall, I liked it.\n\nI never watched "Angel" so I have no problem with seeing David Boreanaz in this new role. I thought he was a very good choice for the part. I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning. I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints". The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Movies like Z, The Butterfly on the Shoulder, Sacco and Vanzetti, The Secret in Her Eyes, The Lives of Others,..etc. took the breaths of their audience in the past decades. And I will add The Collini Case in my 'top movies' list. TCC is a slow paced movie with jaw dropping suspense. Its great storyline, remarkable actings and very clever direction will push you at the edge of your seat for entire two hours. Despite the fact that history has always been told by conquerers, good films in the genre never ceased to fascinate their audience and its the magic of cinema.

Movies like Z, The Butterfly on the Shoulder, Sacco and Vanzetti, The Secret in Her Eyes, The Lives of Others,..etc. took the breaths of their audience in the past decades. And I will add The Collini Case in my 'top movies' list. TCC is a slow paced movie with jaw dropping suspense. Its great storyline, remarkable actings and very clever direction will push you at the edge of your seat for entire two hours. Despite the fact that history has always been told by conquerers, good films in the genre never ceased to fascinate their audience and its the magic of cinema. A very touching film! 8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They have never been scary. There is a stark difference between being scared and startled. Jump scares can be startling. They can take you off guard for a brief moment or two, but after that initial shock, you no longer feel terror, because you have been released. A loud sound effect accompanied with a weird image on screen can be startling. Being scared is feeling downright uncomfortable, uneasy even.The Grudge is not scary. It can be startling, which to me, is annoying. It seemed as if there was a jump scare every other minute in this movie and after a while, it was insanely predictable as to when a jump scare would happen. basically the movie left me with an uncomfortable urge to just chew on 300 mg aspirin so I wouldn't go into cardiac arrest.\n\nAll in all, 2020's The Grudge was just OK and did have some effective horror that draws out its sense of impending doom with subtle artistry and then pops its audience with a bit of violence or gore to get a rise out of them. 6.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3},"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

They have never been scary. There is a stark difference between being scared and startled. Jump scares can be startling. They can take you off guard for a brief moment or two, but after that initial shock, you no longer feel terror, because you have been released. A loud sound effect accompanied with a weird image on screen can be startling. Being scared is feeling downright uncomfortable, uneasy even.The Grudge is not scary. It can be startling, which to me, is annoying. It seemed as if there was a jump scare every other minute in this movie and after a while, it was insanely predictable as to when a jump scare would happen. basically the movie left me with an uncomfortable urge to just chew on 300 mg aspirin so I wouldn't go into cardiac arrest.\n\nAll in all, 2020's The Grudge was just OK and did have some effective horror that draws out its sense of impending doom with subtle artistry and then pops its audience with a bit of violence or gore to get a rise out of them. 6.5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3,"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Unsurprisingly brilliant.","reviewBody":"The least "Coen" of all of the Coens films is also one of their finest. It has a few Coen inflections to it (Damon's twang of a voice, a few random mustached characters crossing paths with our heroes) but for the most part it's a lot more straight forward and less humored. Surprisingly this doesn't detract from the film at all, which is a riveting character journey in classic old school Hollywood fashion. And while generally "old school Hollywood fashion" would be something I would cringe and run away from, the Coens make it enjoyable, emotional and breathtaking. The technical qualities are all astounding; fantastic costumes, a beautiful score and some of the most exquisite cinematography I have ever seen, courtesy of the always reliable Roger Deakins. It's such an entertaining film, with some emotional power that resonates afterwards. There's a lot of twists that I didn't see it taking and none of the characters ended up being what I initially expected them to be. There's a real lack of obvious arcs for these people and that was a nice surprise. The Coens do what they can to avoid Hollywood conventions in what is, at it's core, a very Hollywood film.\n\nAbove all else, the film is a character piece and what a wonderful one it is. Unsurprisingly, these people are written very intelligently, given lots of depth and room to grow and surprise. There's a constant battle over what grit truly means and over the course of the film the balance shifts back and forth over which of the three has the truest grit. From the very opening, we see that Mattie Ross has a whole mess of it, this headstrong girl who won't back down to anyone, despite her small stature. Hailee Steinfeld is remarkable here, an actor with talent well beyond her years. She's entirely convincing, taking a character that could have been this annoying little brat and making her simultaneously strong, whip smart, endearing and adorable. I enjoyed watching her in every second. Jeff Bridges was different than I had expected, but I love his arc throughout the film. Maddie goes to him because she believes he has the most grit of all and that he is the right choice for her, but as the journey goes on she doubts her decision and Rooster Cogburn plays with our perception of him quite a few times. Bridges was my least favorite of the three, performance-wise, but that's not a huge slant given how highly I thought of the other two. Matt Damon gets arguably the most interesting role, a character who is detestable when we first meet him and then has the large task of making us realize that he just may have the truest grit of all. LaBoeuf is a silly man who thinks too highly of himself, but as the film progresses it becomes very hard not to care for him. He's a good man at his heart, as are Maddie and Rooster, and it makes it easy to root for all three of them to come out of this alright.\n\nThis is a film that I enjoyed even more than I thought I would, a Coen film in the most un-Coen of ways (which was a nice change of pace given that their previous effort, A Serious Man, is probably the most Coen film out there). I enjoyed living with these characters very much and wish that there had been more time to just be with them on their journey. The final confrontation with the men they are hunting is turns suspenseful, surprising and a little too short-lived. I didn't much care for the epilogue, but with the wildly entertaining journey that came before it, I can't fault the film that strongly for it. It's a real cinematic piece, surprisingly Hollywood for the Coens, but it doesn't fall into a lot of the traps that it could have. In fact, it does the opposite, jumping into holes where it could become clichéd and sentimental and then digging it's way out, surprising at every turn. I like that the story doesn't quite end after the basic plot is resolved, because it's not about hunting down the man that killed Maddie's father and hoping to bring him to justice. It's about so much more. It's about these characters and finding out who they really are when it all comes down to it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":317835,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The action was hard-hitting, lightning fast, supporting a simple, contained story of one man fighting against an entire tower of enemies in a way that was reminiscent of classics like "Die Hard". Well, if "The Raid" was one of the best action films of the last ten years, Evans' follow-up film "The Raid 2″ has now set the standard for the next twenty. In fact, I'm going to make a bold statement that you can feel free to quote me on:\n\n"The Raid 2″ is the best action movie ever made.\n\nWhere sequels are concerned, this film does absolutely everything right. It takes the frenetic energy of the original, contained within the twenty-story drug den in which it took place, and lets it loose across the urban sprawl of an entire city teeming with warring crime syndicates, corrupt police officers, and the civilians often caught in the crossfire. No longer contained to just one address, the fight scenes in "Raid 2″ cover car chases, cramped subway trains, muddy prison yards, night clubs, and city streets, and every action set piece hits all the right notes. Every punch thrown and bullet fired is made even more effective by the fact that all of the action is done practically. In an era where so much of the action that we see on screen is dominated by the CGI-centric explosion extravaganzas of Michael Bay and the like it's incredibly refreshing to see highly trained stunt professionals being pushed to their limits to deliver a collection of the best action scenes in modern memory. Much of this work is shouldered by the film's lead, Indonesian-born Iko Uwais, the returning star of the first "Raid". Uwais is reminiscent of a younger Jet Li or – dare I say it – Bruce Lee; moving with such self-assured speed and practiced precision that every move deserves multiple looks to take in all the details. The comparison to Lee is bolstered by "The Raid 2″'s finale, which plays out like the final gatecrashing act of "Game of Death", in which our hero has to slug his way through opponents of increasing lethality. Unlike "Game of Death", "The Raid 2″ lets us see our villains in action almost as often as our hero, and it's a credit to Evans as writer/director that each of these characters is absolutely dripping with charisma and cool. There are no wasted characters here; we love every hero and love to hate every villain.\n\nThe script is, with few exceptions, always on-point. What could have simply been a straight-forward action flick with minimal plot to carry us from one action set-piece to another is instead a mad whirlwind of conspiracy, murder, and double and triple-crosses, steadily ratcheting up the tension to the film's explosive conclusion. From a technical standpoint, the impressive cinematography matches the action stride-for- stride and, looking back, there are a dizzying number of wildly choreographed long-takes that put every nuance of the environment, characters, and action on display. Combine this with a pulse-pounding soundtrack and some absolutely superb practical makeup effects accompanying every injury, no matter how small, and "The Raid 2″ is the complete package. With a third film already in the works, making this a trilogy, Hollywood has been put on notice: Gareth Evans has arrived; he's just dramatically changed the landscape of action films and shows no signs of pulling any punches.

Combine this with a pulse-pounding soundtrack and some absolutely superb practical makeup effects accompanying every injury, no matter how small, and "The Raid 2″ is the complete package. With a third film already in the works, making this a trilogy, Hollywood has been put on notice: Gareth Evans has arrived; he's just dramatically changed the landscape of action films and shows no signs of pulling any punches.

I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes "nice" films with pretty people in them.\n\nWell, it turned out she'd seen it, and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm, so I'd have to watch it all by myself (a one night rental, you see).\n\nWe have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia, if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan, I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.\n\nI was glad I could watch Australia alone, as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face (sometimes simultaneously) less embarrassing.\n\nThis is a wonderful, sprawling, completely overdone, yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself, as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.\n\nBe warned: to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive, subtle, academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, redolent with citations, statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy, as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers, destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.\n\nLikewise, the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind, the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land, which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur. The same could be said of any of a thousand successful movies: the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even Ghostbusters. They assume from the start that their viewers will willing to suspend disbelief. This film requires that too.\n\nOnce your disbelief is checked at the door, you can sit back and indulge yourself in Australia. It is a film about emotion, not a documentary. It's whether the emotional truth of the film, often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve, can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.\n\nOther reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end.

I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes "nice" films with pretty people in them.\n\nWell, it turned out she'd seen it, and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm, so I'd have to watch it all by myself (a one night rental, you see).\n\nWe have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia, if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan, I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.\n\nI was glad I could watch Australia alone, as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face (sometimes simultaneously) less embarrassing.\n\nThis is a wonderful, sprawling, completely overdone, yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself, as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.\n\nBe warned: to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive, subtle, academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, redolent with citations, statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy, as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers, destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.\n\nLikewise, the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind, the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land, which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur. The same could be said of any of a thousand successful movies: the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even Ghostbusters. They assume from the start that their viewers will willing to suspend disbelief. This film requires that too.\n\nOnce your disbelief is checked at the door, you can sit back and indulge yourself in Australia. It is a film about emotion, not a documentary. It's whether the emotional truth of the film, often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve, can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.\n\nOther reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end. I join those ranks, and proudly. There is hardly a moment when the action - emotional or actual - is not hitting you right between the eyes, be it the stunning vistas or the awful badness of the baddies, the tender first kiss between the Drover and Lady Sarah, or the razor's edge existence of the young "creamie" boy, Nullah, always on the run from the well-meaning but misguided authorities who would "breed the Aboriginal out of him".\n\nSure, there are some CGI sections that at first seem way over the top, even comic book-like in their execution.

I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes "nice" films with pretty people in them.\n\nWell, it turned out she'd seen it, and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm, so I'd have to watch it all by myself (a one night rental, you see).\n\nWe have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia, if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan, I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.\n\nI was glad I could watch Australia alone, as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face (sometimes simultaneously) less embarrassing.\n\nThis is a wonderful, sprawling, completely overdone, yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself, as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.\n\nBe warned: to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive, subtle, academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, redolent with citations, statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy, as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers, destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.\n\nLikewise, the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind, the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land, which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur. The same could be said of any of a thousand successful movies: the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even Ghostbusters. They assume from the start that their viewers will willing to suspend disbelief. This film requires that too.\n\nOnce your disbelief is checked at the door, you can sit back and indulge yourself in Australia. It is a film about emotion, not a documentary. It's whether the emotional truth of the film, often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve, can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.\n\nOther reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end. I join those ranks, and proudly. There is hardly a moment when the action - emotional or actual - is not hitting you right between the eyes, be it the stunning vistas or the awful badness of the baddies, the tender first kiss between the Drover and Lady Sarah, or the razor's edge existence of the young "creamie" boy, Nullah, always on the run from the well-meaning but misguided authorities who would "breed the Aboriginal out of him".\n\nSure, there are some CGI sections that at first seem way over the top, even comic book-like in their execution. But I'm not sure these weren't intentional. I wonder whether they were deliberately done they way they were to reinforce the magical and mystical thrust of the story? Yes, in Australia there are elements and style quotations from scores of previous movies. It pays homage to Indiana Jones (all four of them), Out Of Africa, Star Wars, any of the great westerns, The African Queen, Pearl Harbour (yes, Darwin really was bombed by the Japanese just after Pearl Harbour, with great loss of life), even The Wizard Of Oz. The latter was used as a metaphor for the boy's journey from grim reality to a mystical land full of evil characters, good fairies and magic animals. When he finally gets to see the movie itself, I'll guarantee even the most hardened eye in the audience will be struggling to hold back a tear.\n\nThe music was an eclectic collage of emotional cues, from the original score, thru the Hollywood musical and on to Elgar's Variations, with jazz, swing and bobbysoxer dance themes in between. Why not? The visuals and the sound reinforced each other, reaching not for footnotable, citable truth but for emotional truth (which is what all good films have ever done).\n\nThis was a great film, completely contrary to my preconceived notions of what it would be like to watch. It receives from me just about the greatest accolade I can offer any move: it's one I know I will watch over and over again, and get more out of with every viewing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120388,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes "nice" films with pretty people in them.\n\nWell, it turned out she'd seen it, and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm, so I'd have to watch it all by myself (a one night rental, you see).\n\nWe have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia, if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan, I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.\n\nI was glad I could watch Australia alone, as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face (sometimes simultaneously) less embarrassing.\n\nThis is a wonderful, sprawling, completely overdone, yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself, as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.\n\nBe warned: to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive, subtle, academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, redolent with citations, statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy, as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers, destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.\n\nLikewise, the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind, the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land, which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur.

I kept being puzzled. During the movie, I started looking on the internet and found out it was a movie series from Hallmark Drama, which I don't have on my provider, so I had not seen. This then made a little more sense to me. Teri Polo and Dylan Walsh had me watching to the end because I was vested enough in their story to want to find out what happened. The main drawback was the overview background that was assumed a viewer would understand, but I didn't.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":267,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In particular, Captain Cold's absurdly dry sense of humor and knack for puns cuts through moments of necessary pilot exposition.\n\nThe real standout, though, is Arthur Darvill as Rip Hunter, whose sharp comedic timing and deeper acting chops should help keep the show grounded in a strong protagonist moving forward. The more Legends of Tomorrow leans on Darvill and Garber for dramatic story lines, the better.\n\nUnfortunately, not all of the characters on the team are well-developed or well-acted. Hawkman and Hawkgirl continue to be as trite and uninteresting as they were during their stint on The Flash. And despite the potential in Vandal Savage as a character, his writing thus far has not been nuanced or compelling enough to set him on par with CW's other seasonal "Big Bads".\n\nMoving forward, the show should succeed if it focuses on its characters and actors that elevate it above mere comic book cheese, and if it executes its promise of time-travel shenanigans in inventive, fun ways.\n\nLegends of Tomorrow doesn't look poised to knock The Flash from its "best in DC" throne just yet. The Flash benefits from not having boring main characters (I'm looking at you Hawkman/Hawkgirl, and Arrow's terrible Laurel Lance). Consistency will be Legends of Tomorrow's biggest challenge if it wants to one-up The Flash and legitimize future expansion of CW's DC Universe. 5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The more Legends of Tomorrow leans on Darvill and Garber for dramatic story lines, the better.\n\nUnfortunately, not all of the characters on the team are well-developed or well-acted.

The Flash benefits from not having boring main characters (I'm looking at you Hawkman/Hawkgirl, and Arrow's terrible Laurel Lance).

    <title lang="pl">365 obiadów Mariety Mareckiej</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Gospodyni programu podpowiada, skąd czerpać inspiracje na codzienne obiady. Marieta Marecka zaprezentuje szereg pomysłowych i prostych w przygotowaniu posiłków. Podpowie też, jak odpowiedzialnie podchodzić do gotowania. W każdym odcinku prowadząca zaprezentuje trzy nowe, często zaskakujące potrawy, które złożą się w gotowy plan na obiad dla całej rodziny. Marieta udzieli również wskazówek na temat tego, co i za ile najlepiej kupić, jakie składniki możemy zamieniać na tańsze oraz jak robić zakupy w sposób przemyślany. Swój udział w tworzeniu programu po raz pierwszy otrzymają również widzowie, którzy poprzez przesyłane przez siebie zdjęcia, prezentować będą zawartość lodówki oraz pomysł na to, co można ugotować z takich składników.</desc>

Heavily recommend it for horror fans.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4273,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Szybko okazuje się, że podróż autostopem nie jest tak ekscytująca, jak się wydawało, kiedy znajduje się w środku nocy na obrzeżach postkomunistycznego miasta. Dziewczyna dostrzega na moście postać, która niebezpiecznie balansuje na barierce. Tak poznaje niezrównoważonego dziwaka Chudego. Oboje postanawiają na jakiś czas obrać taki sam kierunek podróży. Pod osłoną nocy snują się po mieście, w coraz dziwniejsze rejony, doświadczając niezwykłych emocji. Wkrótce między Młodą a Chudym tworzy się nienazwana więź. Całość oparta jest na płaszczyźnie psychodelicznej jak z narkotycznego transu.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Członkowie dwupokoleniowej rodziny próbują żyć ze świadomością o jej rozpadzie. Niektórzy starają się to akceptować i trwać w takiej rzeczywistości, a inni chcą się z niej wydostać. Liczne problemy, rozpadające się związki i rozwody negatywnie wpływają na stosunki międzyludzkie. Wszystko to odbija się na dzieciach, które w ten sposób tracą szansę na normalny rozwój. Przedstawiana historia widziana jest z perspektywy małego dziecka, obserwującego zachowania swoich rodziców. Rozgrywający się dramat ojca Janusza (Grzegorz Juchiewicz) uwidacznia bezsilność w bezwiednie zapoczątkowanej autodestrukcji.</desc>

The Art Of War was also a decent action-flick which co-starred Michael Biehn(Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss). On the action-level, it certainly delivered with a great twist at the end (and some good action as well).\n\nArt of War II co-stars Lochlyn Munroe, a comedy actor who has had some excellent roles in "Dead Man On Campus" and "Scary Movie". The story has nothing to do with the original, so it was purely a marketing-trick. Think of this as Snipes' former direct-to-DVD movies (Steven Seagal has some of these too) so the budget is limited, just like the acting, the story and so on. Like Seagal, Snipes is also years away from his glory-days. And you can tell.. A dull story, bad camera-work, lame characters and so on. \n\nYou can skip this one, even if you love action-films. I still haven't seen The Marksman with Wesley Snipes, but judging by this painful mess, I am not going to bother. Watch Passenger 57 once again instead..","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3646,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3},"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The Art Of War was also a decent action-flick which co-starred Michael Biehn(Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss). On the action-level, it certainly delivered with a great twist at the end (and some good action as well).\n\nArt of War II co-stars Lochlyn Munroe, a comedy actor who has had some excellent roles in "Dead Man On Campus" and "Scary Movie". The story has nothing to do with the original, so it was purely a marketing-trick. Think of this as Snipes' former direct-to-DVD movies (Steven Seagal has some of these too) so the budget is limited, just like the acting, the story and so on. Like Seagal, Snipes is also years away from his glory-days. And you can tell.. A dull story, bad camera-work, lame characters and so on. \n\nYou can skip this one, even if you love action-films. I still haven't seen The Marksman with Wesley Snipes, but judging by this painful mess, I am not going to bother. Watch Passenger 57 once again instead..","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3646,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3,"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The seem low on budget, originality, and plot.\n\nIn this creation the government is out to get a bunch of telekinetics and recruits a poor soul by devious means to help.  There is plenty of over worked recycled twists on evil government organization theme. black coats, shadows, short meaningless lines make these one dimensional cartoons.\n\nDaniel Dae Kim stands out as a good actor in a small role.  He brings a bit of the style of his "Angel" character to the role.  It is hard to miss the link that his "Crusade" character was a telepath and this is a film on telekinetics.  Was this a Sci-Fi casting move to try and draw fans from the other show?  Who knows.  Thankfully he is a decent actor and a pleasure to watch.\n\nThe movie is definitely low budget.  It reflects The Sci-Fi Channels current model of Canadian location, few well known characters, few effects, and woefully terrible plot and character development.  One would think they believe science fiction fans will view anything labeled "scifi."\n\nIf you want a good telekinesis movie, check out "the Fury" ( 1978).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":806,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The seem low on budget, originality, and plot.\n\nIn this creation the government is out to get a bunch of telekinetics and recruits a poor soul by devious means to help.  There is plenty of over worked recycled twists on evil government organization theme. black coats, shadows, short meaningless lines make these one dimensional cartoons.\n\nDaniel Dae Kim stands out as a good actor in a small role.  He brings a bit of the style of his "Angel" character to the role.  It is hard to miss the link that his "Crusade" character was a telepath and this is a film on telekinetics.  Was this a Sci-Fi casting move to try and draw fans from the other show?  Who knows.  Thankfully he is a decent actor and a pleasure to watch.\n\nThe movie is definitely low budget.  It reflects The Sci-Fi Channels current model of Canadian location, few well known characters, few effects, and woefully terrible plot and character development.  One would think they believe science fiction fans will view anything labeled "scifi."\n\nIf you want a good telekinesis movie, check out "the Fury" ( 1978).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":806,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He gratefully uses his talent as a sniper during these chases. The few times he speaks in this movie, show that he's ready for the nuthouse.

When you take matters into your own hand, make damn sure you do it thoroughly. Such a madman wouldn't get a second chance with me. But no, Wyatt with his gas mask (which reminded me of a CD cover from "Therapy?") resurfaces once again and the cat and mouse game restarts. And a cat could well have an advantage in this game, because it was largely pitch dark in this film. Several times I checked if the power went down, because in the end I couldn't see Jack sh*t most of the time.

This Excellent DVD offers a chance to see this little sleeper in a great looking print with a fascinating and funny commentary by the Director.

But still I went into this movie just looking for a good time (that and am a huge fan of old school monster films) and thats what I got. For the uptight and so called expert critics, let me spell it out for you: ITS A POPCORN MOVIE! OF COURSE EVERYTHING GOING TO BLOWN UP TO THE MAX AND GO OVER THE TOP! IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS, THEN DON'T CLAIM YOU DO AND BASH A FILM BECAUSE OF IT! *Ahem* alright on to my review.\n\nPlot: Helsing and his assistant, a frair named Carl, are sent to Translvaynia to protect the last of a gypsy family from being stuck in purgatory due to a curse Dracula put on them. In the process however Helsing must also stop Drac's plan of engulfing the world in darkness all the while battling his minions. Throw in a plot device involving Frankenstein's monster and you have a pretty cool adventure brewing.\n\nI'll admit for a movie that suppose to be about Helsing. They kinda dropped the ball on the story. There's way too much emphasis on the gypsy girl rather him and they don't flesh out his back story about his lost memory and his supposed history with Dracula. Also the movie has a few nonsense parts (the talk with the creepy undertaker) which kinda slows down the film a bit. But still the movie stays on a linear path and the set-ups up to confrontations are well done. Not to mention the confrontation themselves even if some are a little silly (ballroom scene (though a good homage to the Fearless Vampire Killers), the fight with the last bride, Igor and Dracula himself). Yes their CGI laden but I don't care, its a supernatural movie after all. So what better way to do them.\n\nThe actors seem very comfortable with their roles and looks to be having a great time. Extra props go out to the dude who played Frankenstien's monster, I was really feeling for him. Easily one of the best characters in the movie.\n\nAdd to that some excellent backdrops and clothes to which the film really draws you into its 19th century world. Yes the movie is full of flaws but it only for fun and only wants to entertain to which it success in spades. If you don't like it, well fine. But for all who love a good popcorn flick or a fan of old school monsters, you can look no further. Van Helsing is just the ticket for a simple good time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249149,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

IF YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND THIS, THEN DON'T CLAIM YOU DO AND BASH A FILM BECAUSE OF IT! *Ahem* alright on to my review.\n\nPlot: Helsing and his assistant, a frair named Carl, are sent to Translvaynia to protect the last of a gypsy family from being stuck in purgatory due to a curse Dracula put on them. In the process however Helsing must also stop Drac's plan of engulfing the world in darkness all the while battling his minions. Throw in a plot device involving Frankenstein's monster and you have a pretty cool adventure brewing.\n\nI'll admit for a movie that suppose to be about Helsing. They kinda dropped the ball on the story. There's way too much emphasis on the gypsy girl rather him and they don't flesh out his back story about his lost memory and his supposed history with Dracula. Also the movie has a few nonsense parts (the talk with the creepy undertaker) which kinda slows down the film a bit. But still the movie stays on a linear path and the set-ups up to confrontations are well done. Not to mention the confrontation themselves even if some are a little silly (ballroom scene (though a good homage to the Fearless Vampire Killers), the fight with the last bride, Igor and Dracula himself). Yes their CGI laden but I don't care, its a supernatural movie after all. So what better way to do them.\n\nThe actors seem very comfortable with their roles and looks to be having a great time. Extra props go out to the dude who played Frankenstien's monster, I was really feeling for him. Easily one of the best characters in the movie.\n\nAdd to that some excellent backdrops and clothes to which the film really draws you into its 19th century world. Yes the movie is full of flaws but it only for fun and only wants to entertain to which it success in spades. If you don't like it, well fine. But for all who love a good popcorn flick or a fan of old school monsters, you can look no further. Van Helsing is just the ticket for a simple good time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249149,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Jean Reno was as good as usual.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":185982,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"duration":"PT2H19M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I really liked the first episode. Raylen Givins is a complete bad a**! It is well written and had several great lines that made me pause and rewind. The secondary characters were also interesting. I especially liked Raylen childhood friend turned Neo-Nazi, Boyd. I hope that each episode uncovers more about Raylen and what makes him tick. Give Justified a watch and you won't be disappointed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88955,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
