Walsh, the director of Jump.\n\nThe film is set in the summer of 1998 during the Tour de France, which takes place in Ireland that year. The Belgian cyclist Dominique Chabol (Louis Talpe) is at the end of his sports career, but secretly hopes to be able to wear the yellow jersey. When Dominique offers less good speed records, he is kicked out of his team. Thus he loses hope of making his dream come true and prepares to leave his sports career behind. When another member of his old team is disqualified due to a doping error, Dominique gets his last chance to make his dream come true.\n\nThis film comes across as if you are looking at real images of the Tour de France with additional images of how the cyclists prepare for their races. The film is so entertaining and informative for cycling fans. You get a good view of what heavy things cyclists do to have a chance of winning a cycling race. In this way you also see how false it is when other cyclists use doping to win their races in an unfair way.\n\nA downside of this film is that you mainly follow the main character when he is kicked out of his cycling team, looking for a new way of life. He tries to improve his family life and to start a relationship with the doctor who cared for him. When he is allowed to return to his team towards the end of the film, he seems to be occupied with his own sports career and dreams again. The time you, as a viewer, spend after his sports career together with the main character, then appears somewhat aimless.\n\nThe acting is well done by the cast. Louis Talpe comes across well as a cyclist who chooses his career. It's just a shame that his character comes across a bit too selfish when he is allowed to return to his team. The rest of the cast gets a chance to shine as they help the main character with his life after his career.

More recently there has been Uncorked (2020), about a young American who grew up working in his family's Memphis ribhouse but developed a fascination with fine wine that leads him to want to become a sommelier rather than carry on the simple rib restaurant his grandfather and father had developed.\n\nNow, in this movie, which dates from 2018, we find the odyssey of a young Moroccan who wants to do more than just cook standard Moroccan fare in a small-town Moroccan restaurant, aspiring to try new dishes in a great French restaurant that values creativity. He too has to deal with all the locals who can't understand why he can't just go on making what they have always eaten. I very much enjoyed the first half of this movie, set in a small Moroccan town. The protagonist, Elias, has to deal with the closed-mindedness of those around him, people who, as in the other movies, can't accept one person's desire to do something different as just that without interpreting - and resenting - it as a dismissal of what they themselves have always done. What I would have liked here would have been some exploration of what made his grandmother's, and then his cooking different from what everyone was used to.\n\nThe second half of the movie, which deals with Elias' time in Paris, I found less satisfying. It is less focused, and skips over some very important elements (how Elias got to Paris, then how he and his friend finally become a success). It often reminded me of the less interesting, though certainly very moving, parts of a similar French movie, Fahim (2019), dealing with the miserable life of a Bangladeshi chess player and his father who go - illegally - to Paris so that the son can study with a chess master there. The love interest in this movie, never very satisfying even in the first part, just peters away in the second half.\n\nThis is certainly worth watching, but I found it less involving after the protagonist left Morocco.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

More recently there has been Uncorked (2020), about a young American who grew up working in his family's Memphis ribhouse but developed a fascination with fine wine that leads him to want to become a sommelier rather than carry on the simple rib restaurant his grandfather and father had developed.\n\nNow, in this movie, which dates from 2018, we find the odyssey of a young Moroccan who wants to do more than just cook standard Moroccan fare in a small-town Moroccan restaurant, aspiring to try new dishes in a great French restaurant that values creativity. He too has to deal with all the locals who can't understand why he can't just go on making what they have always eaten. I very much enjoyed the first half of this movie, set in a small Moroccan town. The protagonist, Elias, has to deal with the closed-mindedness of those around him, people who, as in the other movies, can't accept one person's desire to do something different as just that without interpreting - and resenting - it as a dismissal of what they themselves have always done. What I would have liked here would have been some exploration of what made his grandmother's, and then his cooking different from what everyone was used to.\n\nThe second half of the movie, which deals with Elias' time in Paris, I found less satisfying. It is less focused, and skips over some very important elements (how Elias got to Paris, then how he and his friend finally become a success). It often reminded me of the less interesting, though certainly very moving, parts of a similar French movie, Fahim (2019), dealing with the miserable life of a Bangladeshi chess player and his father who go - illegally - to Paris so that the son can study with a chess master there. The love interest in this movie, never very satisfying even in the first part, just peters away in the second half.\n\nThis is certainly worth watching, but I found it less involving after the protagonist left Morocco.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

More recently there has been Uncorked (2020), about a young American who grew up working in his family's Memphis ribhouse but developed a fascination with fine wine that leads him to want to become a sommelier rather than carry on the simple rib restaurant his grandfather and father had developed.\n\nNow, in this movie, which dates from 2018, we find the odyssey of a young Moroccan who wants to do more than just cook standard Moroccan fare in a small-town Moroccan restaurant, aspiring to try new dishes in a great French restaurant that values creativity. He too has to deal with all the locals who can't understand why he can't just go on making what they have always eaten. I very much enjoyed the first half of this movie, set in a small Moroccan town. The protagonist, Elias, has to deal with the closed-mindedness of those around him, people who, as in the other movies, can't accept one person's desire to do something different as just that without interpreting - and resenting - it as a dismissal of what they themselves have always done. What I would have liked here would have been some exploration of what made his grandmother's, and then his cooking different from what everyone was used to.\n\nThe second half of the movie, which deals with Elias' time in Paris, I found less satisfying. It is less focused, and skips over some very important elements (how Elias got to Paris, then how he and his friend finally become a success). It often reminded me of the less interesting, though certainly very moving, parts of a similar French movie, Fahim (2019), dealing with the miserable life of a Bangladeshi chess player and his father who go - illegally - to Paris so that the son can study with a chess master there. The love interest in this movie, never very satisfying even in the first part, just peters away in the second half.\n\nThis is certainly worth watching, but I found it less involving after the protagonist left Morocco.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Mind, I don't think he's been on form for a good few years now.\n\nWhat makes Terminator 2 an amazing film aside from the brilliant plot, amazing effects, great screen writing and superb acting is the emotional connection between the Terminator and John Connor.

Do away with the depth of character building, emotional connections and just add over the top action. It's a poor follow up and lacks everything of what made 1 &amp; 2 great. The acting is decent, Davis, Hamilton and Schwarzenegger do a good job but they've got very little to work with here. This is what disappointed me the most. Why does it lack substance? This is James Cameron's epic creation and this is what he serves up along with Tim Miller? A total cash in if I've ever seen one. I'm not going to divulge into the plot anymore, there's no need as it can't even be mentioned in the same breath as the first two films.\n\nIf this film was viewed as a generic action film at the cinema it'd still be mediocre. The fact that this is supposed to follow on from the brilliant Terminator 2 just makes it even more disappointing. This is James Cameron's judgment day.\n\nDo yourselves a favour and wait until it hits home release or if you are planning on seeing it, don't bother watching the first two beforehand, you'll be even more disappointed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156538,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A series that has certainly seen better days. Last Blood's title infers a finale that could wrap the decades old series in a nice little bow and call back to the film that started it all. However, it fails to truly honor its hero in a satisfying way.\n\nThe first film First Blood seems so tamed compared to this newest entry and looking back the series as a whole has changed along the way. First Blood was a film based on the novel of the same name that followed a man struggling to reenter society after the Vietnam War. It was a topical film showcasing the cruelty and disgust many of our veterans received upon returning home. First Blood was a film with scenes of violence, but it was not an action film. It was as far as I can see an anti war film. Every film after this has failed to understand what this film was about and has opted for a more action heavy series and a violent one at that.\n\nLast Blood is First Blood's polar opposite. It relishes in its violence especially in the 3rd act, but at least in this film the reason and motive is clear and can be understood. Last Blood is not concerned with telling the story of a man haunted by war or telling an anti war story. Its focus is on violent revenge and I have to look at it this way. The Rambo series has transformed itself into something completely different from the first film. So, does this work as a revenge thriller?\n\nI would say yes in the most simplistic sense. This is the story of a man who wants to live his final years in peace but is called to action once again to protect someone he loves. It's a story we know all too well. However, it has proved an emotionally resonant story in the past. Rambo's story in this film and his goal is simple and it's simple to a fault, but this film is not concerned with its story as much as it is the action this series has become known for.\n\nLet's talk about the action. I won't lie it's fun. The third act is insane and over the top and indulges in grotesque violence that will bring out the cave man in all of us. This would be fine, other Stallone movies have indulged in violence before and that's the main selling point. His Expendibles trilogy is a great example, but Last Blood tries for something more and lays the seeds for what should be an emotional crescendo for our John Rambo, but the film doesn't do enough to make this satisfying and so the film ends up feeling unbalanced.\n\nRambo's relationship with his niece is the heart of the film and helps in at least giving an emotional connection the film sorely needs. However, these are about the only characters that have any form of depth. The villains are 1 dimensional and nothing more and are there simply to be part of an endless army for Rambo to mutilate and maim in glorious over the top violence which is fun. The film however has a saving grace in the form of Stallone and his performance. Stallone has always been an underrated actor and I believe it hasn't been until recently that he's been receiving some of the recognition he deserves.\n\nThe movies problems perhaps are a result of its extremely short length. If anyone knows about the making of this film it was constantly cut down in the editing room to make it 89 minutes, the shortest Rambo film to date. I believe in a longer version of this film lies a film that is much better, that balances out its more meditative moments with its bursts of violence.\n\nAs it stands the film feels unbalanced and has an extremely slow and boring first two acts that ends on an action packed finale and the the final moments of the film feel like they should be more impactful than they end up being. These last few moments are the best parts of the film and make it feel more like a finale. Perhaps an extended version of the film could be released to fix many of these films short comings, but we'll have to wait and see.\n\nOverall, Rambo: Last Blood is a film that has the right stuff to make this finale great, but what is there is either not enough or cut down to reach a certain runtime. Stallone's performance makes it at least worth a watch as it tries it's best to blend the series violent aspects with the more character driven first film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A series that has certainly seen better days. Last Blood's title infers a finale that could wrap the decades old series in a nice little bow and call back to the film that started it all. However, it fails to truly honor its hero in a satisfying way.\n\nThe first film First Blood seems so tamed compared to this newest entry and looking back the series as a whole has changed along the way. First Blood was a film based on the novel of the same name that followed a man struggling to reenter society after the Vietnam War. It was a topical film showcasing the cruelty and disgust many of our veterans received upon returning home. First Blood was a film with scenes of violence, but it was not an action film. It was as far as I can see an anti war film. Every film after this has failed to understand what this film was about and has opted for a more action heavy series and a violent one at that.\n\nLast Blood is First Blood's polar opposite. It relishes in its violence especially in the 3rd act, but at least in this film the reason and motive is clear and can be understood. Last Blood is not concerned with telling the story of a man haunted by war or telling an anti war story. Its focus is on violent revenge and I have to look at it this way. The Rambo series has transformed itself into something completely different from the first film. So, does this work as a revenge thriller?\n\nI would say yes in the most simplistic sense. This is the story of a man who wants to live his final years in peace but is called to action once again to protect someone he loves. It's a story we know all too well. However, it has proved an emotionally resonant story in the past. Rambo's story in this film and his goal is simple and it's simple to a fault, but this film is not concerned with its story as much as it is the action this series has become known for.\n\nLet's talk about the action. I won't lie it's fun. The third act is insane and over the top and indulges in grotesque violence that will bring out the cave man in all of us. This would be fine, other Stallone movies have indulged in violence before and that's the main selling point. His Expendibles trilogy is a great example, but Last Blood tries for something more and lays the seeds for what should be an emotional crescendo for our John Rambo, but the film doesn't do enough to make this satisfying and so the film ends up feeling unbalanced.\n\nRambo's relationship with his niece is the heart of the film and helps in at least giving an emotional connection the film sorely needs. However, these are about the only characters that have any form of depth. The villains are 1 dimensional and nothing more and are there simply to be part of an endless army for Rambo to mutilate and maim in glorious over the top violence which is fun. The film however has a saving grace in the form of Stallone and his performance. Stallone has always been an underrated actor and I believe it hasn't been until recently that he's been receiving some of the recognition he deserves.\n\nThe movies problems perhaps are a result of its extremely short length. If anyone knows about the making of this film it was constantly cut down in the editing room to make it 89 minutes, the shortest Rambo film to date. I believe in a longer version of this film lies a film that is much better, that balances out its more meditative moments with its bursts of violence.\n\nAs it stands the film feels unbalanced and has an extremely slow and boring first two acts that ends on an action packed finale and the the final moments of the film feel like they should be more impactful than they end up being. These last few moments are the best parts of the film and make it feel more like a finale. Perhaps an extended version of the film could be released to fix many of these films short comings, but we'll have to wait and see.\n\nOverall, Rambo: Last Blood is a film that has the right stuff to make this finale great, but what is there is either not enough or cut down to reach a certain runtime. Stallone's performance makes it at least worth a watch as it tries it's best to blend the series violent aspects with the more character driven first film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints".

As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack.

I heard about Spongebob Squarepants and decided to check it out. Now I watch every episode religiously! It's amazing! I don't think I ever seen anything as surreal or as funny in a kids show as this! The show takes place in Bikini Bottom, an underwater town. Spongebob Squarepants (voiced by the amazingly talented Ton Kenny) is a sponge that works as a fry cook at the Crusty Krab, run by one Mr Krabs (voiced by Tom Clancy who many people will remember from Shawshank Redemption). Spongebob is a kid at heart and a little stupid, but gets up to the most amazing adventures. Alongside Spongebob are his best friend Patrick Starfish (Bill Fagerbakke) who is even more stupid than Spongebob, Sandy Cheeks (Carolyn Lawrence) a squirrel that lives underwater for some reason, Squidward Tentacles (Rodger Bumpass) Spongebobs moody next door neighbour, Mrs Puff (Mary Jo Catlett) Spongebob's driving instructor and Plankton (Mr Lawrence) a very tiny sea animal with a Napoleon Complex.\n\nWhat makes the show so funny is the situations that Spongebob and his friend Patrick get themselves into. They are both very stupid and child like, meaning that they get into trouble on a regular basis, which makes for exciting episodes. There are some huge laugh out loud moments and some of them stuff that they get up to will make your stomach churn with laughter. All the characters are amazingly put together and they all work. Each have their own personality which allows them to carry on the story and let Spongebob interact with them all.\n\nOne of the funniest stories is the send up of Batman and Robin where Spongebob and Patrick try to bring out of retirement their two favourite heroes. Mermaid Man (Ernist Borgnine) and Barnacle Boy (Tim Conway). Anyone who's ever watched the classic Adam West Batman will appreciate the humour of this episode! All in all, a very funny cartoon. It's insane enough for kids to enjoy, but also so funny that many adults will enjoy it (as long as they get the humour). Take it for what it is. Don't' try and analyse it. Just watch and enjoy.\n\nOh and one more thing. In one episode, the background music is provide by metals most greatest heroes, PANTERA!!!!!!!!\n\n10/10!!!!!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86260,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Spongebob Squarepants (voiced by the amazingly talented Ton Kenny) is a sponge that works as a fry cook at the Crusty Krab, run by one Mr Krabs (voiced by Tom Clancy who many people will remember from Shawshank Redemption). Spongebob is a kid at heart and a little stupid, but gets up to the most amazing adventures. Alongside Spongebob are his best friend Patrick Starfish (Bill Fagerbakke) who is even more stupid than Spongebob, Sandy Cheeks (Carolyn Lawrence) a squirrel that lives underwater for some reason, Squidward Tentacles (Rodger Bumpass) Spongebobs moody next door neighbour, Mrs Puff (Mary Jo Catlett) Spongebob's driving instructor and Plankton (Mr Lawrence) a very tiny sea animal with a Napoleon Complex.\n\nWhat makes the show so funny is the situations that Spongebob and his friend Patrick get themselves into. They are both very stupid and child like, meaning that they get into trouble on a regular basis, which makes for exciting episodes. There are some huge laugh out loud moments and some of them stuff that they get up to will make your stomach churn with laughter. All the characters are amazingly put together and they all work. Each have their own personality which allows them to carry on the story and let Spongebob interact with them all.\n\nOne of the funniest stories is the send up of Batman and Robin where Spongebob and Patrick try to bring out of retirement their two favourite heroes. Mermaid Man (Ernist Borgnine) and Barnacle Boy (Tim Conway). Anyone who's ever watched the classic Adam West Batman will appreciate the humour of this episode! All in all, a very funny cartoon. It's insane enough for kids to enjoy, but also so funny that many adults will enjoy it (as long as they get the humour). Take it for what it is. Don't' try and analyse it. Just watch and enjoy.\n\nOh and one more thing. In one episode, the background music is provide by metals most greatest heroes, PANTERA!!!!!!!!\n\n10/10!!!!!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86260,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The best animated film of the year!","reviewBody":"Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the villain in the "Fix-it Felix" arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy. He also befriends a character known as Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) from a candy-coated racing game called "Sugar Rush". When Ralph accidentally unleashes a threat in the arcade, he tries his best to save the day and become a true hero.\n\nI had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever – a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.\n\nSo, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than Disney/PIXAR's Brave (which was also very good).\n\nJohn C. Reilly delivered a strong performance as the title character, who wants to make a change in his life, achieve it, and become what he wants to be. That's what a great movie character is about. Sarah Silverman provides most of the movie's funny moments as one of the "Sugar Rush" characters who Ralph befriends, and is a "glitch" (a character who faults the game). She tries to get Ralph for help to become a racer once again. Jack McBrayer (from the hit-show, 30 Rock) has an amusing supporting role as Fix-it Felix, the main hero in the "Fix-it Felix" arcade game, who sets out to find Ralph and get him back to where he belongs. Jane Lynch does a great job playing the main character in a first-person shooter game known as "Hero's Duty", who tries to find Ralph, alongside Felix.\n\nI didn't see the movie in 3D; which I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D, but I decided to stick with the 2D because of the sharp, pristine screen.\n\nThe animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.\n\nThe characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.\n\nGenerally, movies from Disney and/or PIXAR give a lot heart into their stories, which makes the tone of the movie become very sweet. Wreck-it Ralph has enough heart to make it that way. From start to finish, this movie is a lot of fun, and when families bring their kids to see this movie, they're going to fall in love with it.\n\n10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":387756,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The best animated film of the year!","reviewBody":"Disney has made some really good animated movies, but they had never done a lot of movies that are as bright and original as Wreck-it Ralph, the new animated film from Disney. The movie centers on Ralph (voiced by John C. Reilly), the villain in the "Fix-it Felix" arcade game, who decides to become a hero. Because he doesn't like being a bad guy, he goes into some of the video games in order to learn what it's like to become a good guy. He also befriends a character known as Vanellope von Schweetz (voiced by Sarah Silverman) from a candy-coated racing game called "Sugar Rush". When Ralph accidentally unleashes a threat in the arcade, he tries his best to save the day and become a true hero.\n\nI had extremely high expectations for this movie. I had the feeling that this will turn out to be an excellent animated film. I thought the premise to this sounded really cool and clever – a love letter to video games. I really love the voice cast.\n\nSo, did Wreck-it Ralph met my expectations? Absolutely! This was such a fun animated movie for all ages, and better than Disney/PIXAR's Brave (which was also very good).\n\nJohn C. Reilly delivered a strong performance as the title character, who wants to make a change in his life, achieve it, and become what he wants to be. That's what a great movie character is about. Sarah Silverman provides most of the movie's funny moments as one of the "Sugar Rush" characters who Ralph befriends, and is a "glitch" (a character who faults the game). She tries to get Ralph for help to become a racer once again. Jack McBrayer (from the hit-show, 30 Rock) has an amusing supporting role as Fix-it Felix, the main hero in the "Fix-it Felix" arcade game, who sets out to find Ralph and get him back to where he belongs. Jane Lynch does a great job playing the main character in a first-person shooter game known as "Hero's Duty", who tries to find Ralph, alongside Felix.\n\nI didn't see the movie in 3D; which I must say it does look pretty darn good in 3D, but I decided to stick with the 2D because of the sharp, pristine screen.\n\nThe animation is simply wonderful; the bright colors, the set-ups, the environments, the characters all look fantastic. At times, the movie is very gorgeous to look at on the big screen.\n\nThe characters in this were likable and funny. It was awesome to see some video game characters making cameos (like Bowser, Pac-Man, Sonic, etc.). The story to the movie is well-thought out and genuinely clever. It's always nice to see something new to the table. I really liked the themes to the movie: What does it mean to be a true hero? How can the main character's goal become a success? And so forth.\n\nGenerally, movies from Disney and/or PIXAR give a lot heart into their stories, which makes the tone of the movie become very sweet. Wreck-it Ralph has enough heart to make it that way. From start to finish, this movie is a lot of fun, and when families bring their kids to see this movie, they're going to fall in love with it.\n\n10/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":387756,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In the meantime we meet Betty's hunky handsome protective Grandson Stephen perfectly played by Russell Tovey who seeks out to find out all he can about his Grandmother's new border and boyfriend.\n\nJim Carter who plays Mr Carson in Downton Abbey is very impressive in the very different role of Vincent the best friend of Roy Courtney and "business associate " it's a great ensemble cast and this film has some great plot twisters and surprises that at times may seem a little improbable but that didn't bother me a bit.\n\nIt's the performances of McKellen and Mirren that are sublime, subtle and mesmerising the range of these two actors is astonishing when you think back to characters like Helen Mirren in The Queen or Catherine the Great and Maria Altman in Woman in Gold then Ian McKellen as Gandalf or James Whale in Gods and Monsters and King Lear to see them together in a film for the first time ,they have appeared on stage together in 2001 in Dance of Death on Broadway.\n\nI must mention the great score by Carter Burwell it's perfect and gives great atmosphere to the emotional and suspenseful plot I really like his scores and this is up with his previous film scores for Carol, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing ,Missouri and In Bruges.\n\nI really enjoyed The Good Liar go see it and don't let anyone tell you the outcome of this complex story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29215,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the meantime we meet Betty's hunky handsome protective Grandson Stephen perfectly played by Russell Tovey who seeks out to find out all he can about his Grandmother's new border and boyfriend.\n\nJim Carter who plays Mr Carson in Downton Abbey is very impressive in the very different role of Vincent the best friend of Roy Courtney and "business associate " it's a great ensemble cast and this film has some great plot twisters and surprises that at times may seem a little improbable but that didn't bother me a bit.\n\nIt's the performances of McKellen and Mirren that are sublime, subtle and mesmerising the range of these two actors is astonishing when you think back to characters like Helen Mirren in The Queen or Catherine the Great and Maria Altman in Woman in Gold then Ian McKellen as Gandalf or James Whale in Gods and Monsters and King Lear to see them together in a film for the first time ,they have appeared on stage together in 2001 in Dance of Death on Broadway.\n\nI must mention the great score by Carter Burwell it's perfect and gives great atmosphere to the emotional and suspenseful plot I really like his scores and this is up with his previous film scores for Carol, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing ,Missouri and In Bruges.\n\nI really enjoyed The Good Liar go see it and don't let anyone tell you the outcome of this complex story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29215,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's an odd pairing, but at least you can say these guys have range. To helm this film, about a hit-man whose drinking problem has caused sloppiness and perhaps the demise of his Polish gang in Buffalo, we have John Dahl. I am a huge fan of Rounders, so I was hoping for some of the same here, with a dramatic arc that worked and made sense intelligently, but also bringing the laughs that the trailer promised. Thankfully this film doesn't disappoint. Yes, there are some moments of disbelief, but the dry, straight-laced delivery of everything else makes up for the leaps in logic that would otherwise eat at me for the duration. While not laugh-out-loud funny, Dahl has put together a nice slow burning comedy that allows its characters to live and breathe realistically and evolve in a somewhat believable manner.\n\nOur aforementioned hit-man is played brilliantly by Ben Kingsley. I remember when I used to look at him as just Ghandi, but after the diverse catalog of films he has done recently, I've realized that he isn't afraid to branch out into darker fare. His role here has a lot going for it in comedic termshe is an alcoholic, a loner that kills for money, and a resident of the arctic pole of Buffalo. Put all that together and you can think of a few funny situations for him to get into. To the filmmakers' credit, though, we never really get any of that except for the opening "job." When Kingsley's Frank sleeps through the one big job he is relied on to do, everything falls apart. What happens next is his journey to sobriety and friendship/love to pull him through to an understanding about what he really is living for. What worked for a film like The Matador couldn't be as effective here. Frank isn't having a nervous breakdown or losing his cool, he is off the job seeking help so that he can go back on the payroll. We don't need him to drunkenly wave a loaded gun at people, the comedy instead comes from his fish-out-of-water situation, being a cold-hearted killer trying to warm up to recovering alcoholics and a community he is not used to being sober around.\n\nKingsley definitely plays the role to perfection, never faltering from his matter-of-fact tone or takes no crap attitude. Everything out of his mouth is carefully orchestrated and he is not one to waste his own or others' time. This fact makes some scenes hilarious because of the reactions from those he is speaking to. When he speaks from the heart and seriously, while sprinkling in his own experiences murdering people, during AA meetings, the utter silence and occasional Amen from the audience is gold. Besides his unfaltering demeanor and his sardonic sarcasm, it is when he plays off of love interest Téa Leoni when some of the best laughs occur. These two have a wonderful rapport and when they go at each other rapid fire, with one quip/comeback after another, you'd think it was all ad-libbedthe timing is that good. Leoni has been surprising me lately with her career. I don't know why I used to think she was annoying, but recently having seen films like House of D and her early work in Flirting With Disaster, I realize that she is good at both the dramatic and the comedic.\n\nThe who's who of supporting players also does a nice job anchoring the story. Luke Wilson seems to really just be playing himself, but the laidback friend is what is needed for the role. Philip Baker Hall and Dennis Farina show how it's done as two rival mob bosses in Buffalo, (yes, I said mob bosses in Buffalo, I'm constantly scared for my life when walking around downtown at night). Their storyline is handled well and counteracts the subtle humor going on at rehab in San Francisco with some tense moments trying to keep the Polish afloat at the hands of the ever increasing Irish crew. Mention is also needed for Bill Pullman who has been making some good choices of late in small supporting roles. His self-absorbed real estate agent is entertaining because his ego won't let him be intimidated by the killer he is conversing with.\n\nThe laughs may not come over and over again, but when they do it's smartly and appropriately. The fact that everyone in San Fran who hears Kingsley is a hit-man just accept it like someone saying they washed their clothes that morning is a bit rough to get by, but really it doesn't matter in terms of plot progression. The writers also try to distill the problem with Frank saying how it's Alcoholics "Anonymous," which brings a smile to your face for nothing more than the corniness of the line. I also don't know how perfect placing the movie in Buffalo was. It seems the writers needed a cold, drinking town up north and our wonderful home of Buffalo was the first to come to their heads. When was the last time you heard about the Irish and Polish mob going to war while the Greeks stood back to see who came out on top? Yeah, that's right, never. I did like the touch of hometown words by naming an Irish bar Scajaqueda. Just proves again these guys had no clue what they were doing with location. Overall, though, the film works despite any of its shortcomings.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":17980,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's an odd pairing, but at least you can say these guys have range. To helm this film, about a hit-man whose drinking problem has caused sloppiness and perhaps the demise of his Polish gang in Buffalo, we have John Dahl. I am a huge fan of Rounders, so I was hoping for some of the same here, with a dramatic arc that worked and made sense intelligently, but also bringing the laughs that the trailer promised. Thankfully this film doesn't disappoint. Yes, there are some moments of disbelief, but the dry, straight-laced delivery of everything else makes up for the leaps in logic that would otherwise eat at me for the duration. While not laugh-out-loud funny, Dahl has put together a nice slow burning comedy that allows its characters to live and breathe realistically and evolve in a somewhat believable manner.\n\nOur aforementioned hit-man is played brilliantly by Ben Kingsley. I remember when I used to look at him as just Ghandi, but after the diverse catalog of films he has done recently, I've realized that he isn't afraid to branch out into darker fare. His role here has a lot going for it in comedic termshe is an alcoholic, a loner that kills for money, and a resident of the arctic pole of Buffalo. Put all that together and you can think of a few funny situations for him to get into. To the filmmakers' credit, though, we never really get any of that except for the opening "job." When Kingsley's Frank sleeps through the one big job he is relied on to do, everything falls apart. What happens next is his journey to sobriety and friendship/love to pull him through to an understanding about what he really is living for. What worked for a film like The Matador couldn't be as effective here. Frank isn't having a nervous breakdown or losing his cool, he is off the job seeking help so that he can go back on the payroll. We don't need him to drunkenly wave a loaded gun at people, the comedy instead comes from his fish-out-of-water situation, being a cold-hearted killer trying to warm up to recovering alcoholics and a community he is not used to being sober around.\n\nKingsley definitely plays the role to perfection, never faltering from his matter-of-fact tone or takes no crap attitude. Everything out of his mouth is carefully orchestrated and he is not one to waste his own or others' time. This fact makes some scenes hilarious because of the reactions from those he is speaking to. When he speaks from the heart and seriously, while sprinkling in his own experiences murdering people, during AA meetings, the utter silence and occasional Amen from the audience is gold. Besides his unfaltering demeanor and his sardonic sarcasm, it is when he plays off of love interest Téa Leoni when some of the best laughs occur. These two have a wonderful rapport and when they go at each other rapid fire, with one quip/comeback after another, you'd think it was all ad-libbedthe timing is that good. Leoni has been surprising me lately with her career. I don't know why I used to think she was annoying, but recently having seen films like House of D and her early work in Flirting With Disaster, I realize that she is good at both the dramatic and the comedic.\n\nThe who's who of supporting players also does a nice job anchoring the story. Luke Wilson seems to really just be playing himself, but the laidback friend is what is needed for the role. Philip Baker Hall and Dennis Farina show how it's done as two rival mob bosses in Buffalo, (yes, I said mob bosses in Buffalo, I'm constantly scared for my life when walking around downtown at night). Their storyline is handled well and counteracts the subtle humor going on at rehab in San Francisco with some tense moments trying to keep the Polish afloat at the hands of the ever increasing Irish crew. Mention is also needed for Bill Pullman who has been making some good choices of late in small supporting roles. His self-absorbed real estate agent is entertaining because his ego won't let him be intimidated by the killer he is conversing with.\n\nThe laughs may not come over and over again, but when they do it's smartly and appropriately. The fact that everyone in San Fran who hears Kingsley is a hit-man just accept it like someone saying they washed their clothes that morning is a bit rough to get by, but really it doesn't matter in terms of plot progression. The writers also try to distill the problem with Frank saying how it's Alcoholics "Anonymous," which brings a smile to your face for nothing more than the corniness of the line. I also don't know how perfect placing the movie in Buffalo was. It seems the writers needed a cold, drinking town up north and our wonderful home of Buffalo was the first to come to their heads. When was the last time you heard about the Irish and Polish mob going to war while the Greeks stood back to see who came out on top? Yeah, that's right, never. I did like the touch of hometown words by naming an Irish bar Scajaqueda. Just proves again these guys had no clue what they were doing with location. Overall, though, the film works despite any of its shortcomings.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":17980,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

My Extraordinary Summer with Tess deserves a place with the classics, a near perfect C of A movie.\n\nTo begin with, the scenery around the Dutch island is fabulous. I always wondered what those Friesland islands look like, and now I know. Miles of nearly empty white sand beaches, but beware of the muddy quicksand at low tide, as you will see. In addition, the lighthouse becomes, to me, an important character.\n\nEleven-year-old, Josephine Arendsen plays Tess and switches between moods lightning fast.

My Extraordinary Summer with Tess deserves a place with the classics, a near perfect C of A movie.\n\nTo begin with, the scenery around the Dutch island is fabulous. I always wondered what those Friesland islands look like, and now I know. Miles of nearly empty white sand beaches, but beware of the muddy quicksand at low tide, as you will see. In addition, the lighthouse becomes, to me, an important character.\n\nEleven-year-old, Josephine Arendsen plays Tess and switches between moods lightning fast. Unlike many off the present day crop of Coming of Age movies, she is utterly real. Not adorable, not particularly feminine or pretty, or nerdy, she just comes across as a real person.

There were too many ideas and they all clashed and the story didn't make sense at times. The "comedy" scenes felt awkward and forced, just like The Nun, and overall came across like it was supposed to be a teen suspense film rather than a horror film. It kept me at the edge off my seat a bit but never went beyond that. Annabelle Creation and the first Conjuring are still the best films out of this whole franchise.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":61639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So-so!","reviewBody":"The pilot episode sets forth the promising tale of a motley crew destined for greatness on a romp through time and space. And, for the most part, it succeeds at continuing a trend of mostly-good DC Superhero TV on the CW. Helped along by several characters that have earned us caring about them from their development on Arrow and The Flash, Victor Garber's Martin Stein, Caity Lotz's Sarah Lance, and Brandon Routh's Ray Palmer ground the show with enough heart to kick-start it into action.\n\nMeanwhile, Snart and Rory continue to play the well characterized pair of funny anti-heroes that we have seen again and again on the other CW shows. In particular, Captain Cold's absurdly dry sense of humor and knack for puns cuts through moments of necessary pilot exposition.\n\nThe real standout, though, is Arthur Darvill as Rip Hunter, whose sharp comedic timing and deeper acting chops should help keep the show grounded in a strong protagonist moving forward. The more Legends of Tomorrow leans on Darvill and Garber for dramatic story lines, the better.\n\nUnfortunately, not all of the characters on the team are well-developed or well-acted. Hawkman and Hawkgirl continue to be as trite and uninteresting as they were during their stint on The Flash. And despite the potential in Vandal Savage as a character, his writing thus far has not been nuanced or compelling enough to set him on par with CW's other seasonal "Big Bads".\n\nMoving forward, the show should succeed if it focuses on its characters and actors that elevate it above mere comic book cheese, and if it executes its promise of time-travel shenanigans in inventive, fun ways.\n\nLegends of Tomorrow doesn't look poised to knock The Flash from its "best in DC" throne just yet. The Flash benefits from not having boring main characters (I'm looking at you Hawkman/Hawkgirl, and Arrow's terrible Laurel Lance). Consistency will be Legends of Tomorrow's biggest challenge if it wants to one-up The Flash and legitimize future expansion of CW's DC Universe. 5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As foul and degrading as newer gore porn flicks are today, Hellbound walks all over them with style and substance which has been unmatched ever since.

Pinhead even begins to look human at this point showing the "bad guys" in a different light. Before long the demons actually become the "good guys", and temporarily co-exist with Kirsty to counter the evil Doctor's hand over hell.\n\nThe violence and gore offered by Hellbound is excessive and delivered to the viewer in such horrific, profane ways it has definitely had an impact on its viewing demographic. Barker made a great job of communicating to the director his view of the film from a novel and it's a gruesome one. So gruesome it will immediately turn away many within the opening minutes.\n\nI recommend this movie for anyone who's into horror or those who think the genre is just Hostel and Saw.

So-so!","reviewBody":"The pilot episode sets forth the promising tale of a motley crew destined for greatness on a romp through time and space. And, for the most part, it succeeds at continuing a trend of mostly-good DC Superhero TV on the CW.

Wyraźnie nie pasuje on do środowiska pracowników fizycznych. W trosce o własną pozycję, zamierza trzymać dyscyplinę twardą ręką. Nagły wypadek, którego ofiarą staje się jeden z ukraińskich robotników, wystawia zasady moralne Krzysztofa na próbę. Zdaje on sobie sprawę z tego, że łatwo być stanowczym tylko w sprzyjających okolicznościach. Jednak trudno mu przeciwstawić się złu, kiedy w grę wchodzą dramatyczne konsekwencje.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Młoda ucieka z domu jak najdalej od smutnej, bezbarwnej miejscowości. Szybko okazuje się, że podróż autostopem nie jest tak ekscytująca, jak się wydawało, kiedy znajduje się w środku nocy na obrzeżach postkomunistycznego miasta. Dziewczyna dostrzega na moście postać, która niebezpiecznie balansuje na barierce. Tak poznaje niezrównoważonego dziwaka Chudego. Oboje postanawiają na jakiś czas obrać taki sam kierunek podróży. Pod osłoną nocy snują się po mieście, w coraz dziwniejsze rejony, doświadczając niezwykłych emocji. Wkrótce między Młodą a Chudym tworzy się nienazwana więź. Całość oparta jest na płaszczyźnie psychodelicznej jak z narkotycznego transu.</desc>

The downside is the filmmaker approaches the subject matter as if he has to pad out a doctoral thesis by hammering multiple square pegs into round holes to make a point. The inclusion of a number of over-rated current women filmmakers lessens the strength of this film.\n\nBest way to watch this film is to pre-record it and pause when you discover a filmmaker you want to deep dive into. The filmmaker has put screen grabs up on his websiteso you can find the films that are of interest. The downside is most of the films, if they're even on IMDb do not have current rights holders listed. Hopefully Cohen Media Group, The Criterion Collection, Turner Classic Movies and Kanopy who have teamed up to release this documentary across multiple platforms in the US will also track down the rights holders and release many of the films referenced.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":227,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT14H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Can't fault the actors, though - this is an unusual role for Bacon, who here comes off as a tough, strong, blue-collar kind of guy - he and his family are close to what one might call white trash, but they're never portrayed as being mean-spirited or hateful. This is just one of those cases where weird stuff happens to nice folk, kind of like the clan in "Poltergeist."\n\nSo this is a stylish psychological/supernatural thriller with game performances by a capable cast.

So people step into the car, peer into it, or generally get too close to it --and they're lunch. Of course the Hybrid is able to go from any make or model to any other as suits it. So reader, is that really your car parked at the corner? Best check under the hood before you get in.\n\nThe movie starts out with the Hybrid, sleek and black, cruising the Chicago streets one night. There are some good shots of it from different angles (including nice sky views). It not only looks cool, but ominous and deadly; predatory.

The emergency exit doesn't work because Ray "the genius" welded it shut. Even sealed off windows. "Why'd he do that Boloxxxi?" --Well reader, he said he wanted to keep junkies out.

When the weather outbreaks do hit, we're treated to flying CGI cars and hilarious shots of people/buildings turning to ice as the tornado passes over them. I don't mind a bit of cheese like this, but the rest of the film is so poor as to make actually watching it just not worthwhile.\n\nThe acting is extremely wooden, and the characters anything but true to life. Nobody seems to show any emotion and you wonder whether those involved are all Stepford creations. The thrills are nonsensical and short-lived, and the supposed technological explanations ridiculous. Sadly, this is exactly what I was expecting from a 'Syfy Channel' television movie, and I got it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1643,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.1},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When the weather outbreaks do hit, we're treated to flying CGI cars and hilarious shots of people/buildings turning to ice as the tornado passes over them. I don't mind a bit of cheese like this, but the rest of the film is so poor as to make actually watching it just not worthwhile.\n\nThe acting is extremely wooden, and the characters anything but true to life. Nobody seems to show any emotion and you wonder whether those involved are all Stepford creations. The thrills are nonsensical and short-lived, and the supposed technological explanations ridiculous. Sadly, this is exactly what I was expecting from a 'Syfy Channel' television movie, and I got it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1643,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.1,"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The men listed above are all Master Class in my opinion and dare I say Edgar Wright is on his way to joining them?\n\nSummary\n\nBaby Driver follows a young man who goes by the name "Baby" (Elgort) who is what the title suggests, a Driver and a damn good one. His talents led him to becoming the prized getaway driver for a group of criminals. With his heart not aligned with the lifestyle and actions of his co workers he seeks a new start, especially after becoming interested in a girl. It is until he finds himself ready to abandon the life he finds out how intertwined he really is. \n\nReview\n\nPros Referencing back to the intro, the first 6 minutes of this film shows why Wright is in a class only a few are in. The scene uses its soundtrack to act as choreography, every snare hit and kick means something and are perfectly timed to the world our characters are in. We the audience soon realize that music is more than just a soundtrack in this film, but provides an arc for our characters, especially Baby. We learn a lot about him based solely off of the music being played, which is unlike anything I have seen at this level. We then proceed to a long tracking shot of Baby navigating to a coffee shop, which in my opinion is one of the most beautiful shots of 2017. I never thought Watching someone get coffee would be this entertaining. Wright does a good job from the start of putting us into this kids world while simultaneously showing us why he doesn't belong in it. The casting choices were all good and added different elements to the story. Baby was the only one tied to music physically through his iPod, but each character was choreographed as if they were listening too. The action was shot really well especially the getaway scenes, both on foot and in the car. The car chase scenes are pure brilliance making The Fast and The Furious movies look 2nd tier. Edgar truly kept me engaged and I never felt cheated in any scene. \n\nCons\n\nMuch of the film focused on visuals to the point where I felt some characters were a tad bit flat. Subtracting Baby and Doc (Kevin Spacy), I felt the others could have had a little more substance. Some of their decisions and actions felt somewhat robotic in my opinion. With that being said Buddy (Hamm) and Batts (Foxx) did shine in a couple of scenes due to them being quality actors. With this being said please understand that even this didn't ruin this movie due to them still being entertaining characters. \n\nLastly the only other minor issue I had was the romance. Although there was nothing wrong with the acting or chemistry between the characters, it was just a little difficult to believe or get invested in.\n\nConclusion/Grade\n\nWhat makes Baby Driver great is that it is a unique experience and is visually stunning. Edgar Wright does a great job of blending action, suspense, romance and comedy making it one of the most enjoyable films of 2017. \n\n8.1/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":458028,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Actually, I was not sure how she avoided jail at all, and 28 days seemed too short a time for all the hilarity, action and breakthroughs in this film, but other than these things, I was really impressed with Bullock and the ensemble acting - the balance of comedy and drama. The one actor I thought over-acted was in the character of Gwen's boyfriend. He was too much, and it was a relief to see him off the screen. Viggo Mortensen is endearing as the other guy for Gwen. I would like to have seen more of them together. I think people will love the soap opera gags and the send-up of drug/alcohol treatment centers, but will also get the serious nature of the interactions in the "chemistry" among all the characters in treatment in the film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":46219,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Actually, I was not sure how she avoided jail at all, and 28 days seemed too short a time for all the hilarity, action and breakthroughs in this film, but other than these things, I was really impressed with Bullock and the ensemble acting - the balance of comedy and drama. The one actor I thought over-acted was in the character of Gwen's boyfriend. He was too much, and it was a relief to see him off the screen. Viggo Mortensen is endearing as the other guy for Gwen. I would like to have seen more of them together. I think people will love the soap opera gags and the send-up of drug/alcohol treatment centers, but will also get the serious nature of the interactions in the "chemistry" among all the characters in treatment in the film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":46219,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The men listed above are all Master Class in my opinion and dare I say Edgar Wright is on his way to joining them?\n\nSummary\n\nBaby Driver follows a young man who goes by the name "Baby" (Elgort) who is what the title suggests, a Driver and a damn good one. His talents led him to becoming the prized getaway driver for a group of criminals. With his heart not aligned with the lifestyle and actions of his co workers he seeks a new start, especially after becoming interested in a girl. It is until he finds himself ready to abandon the life he finds out how intertwined he really is. \n\nReview\n\nPros Referencing back to the intro, the first 6 minutes of this film shows why Wright is in a class only a few are in. The scene uses its soundtrack to act as choreography, every snare hit and kick means something and are perfectly timed to the world our characters are in. We the audience soon realize that music is more than just a soundtrack in this film, but provides an arc for our characters, especially Baby. We learn a lot about him based solely off of the music being played, which is unlike anything I have seen at this level. We then proceed to a long tracking shot of Baby navigating to a coffee shop, which in my opinion is one of the most beautiful shots of 2017. I never thought Watching someone get coffee would be this entertaining. Wright does a good job from the start of putting us into this kids world while simultaneously showing us why he doesn't belong in it. The casting choices were all good and added different elements to the story. Baby was the only one tied to music physically through his iPod, but each character was choreographed as if they were listening too. The action was shot really well especially the getaway scenes, both on foot and in the car. The car chase scenes are pure brilliance making The Fast and The Furious movies look 2nd tier. Edgar truly kept me engaged and I never felt cheated in any scene. \n\nCons\n\nMuch of the film focused on visuals to the point where I felt some characters were a tad bit flat. Subtracting Baby and Doc (Kevin Spacy), I felt the others could have had a little more substance. Some of their decisions and actions felt somewhat robotic in my opinion. With that being said Buddy (Hamm) and Batts (Foxx) did shine in a couple of scenes due to them being quality actors. With this being said please understand that even this didn't ruin this movie due to them still being entertaining characters. \n\nLastly the only other minor issue I had was the romance. Although there was nothing wrong with the acting or chemistry between the characters, it was just a little difficult to believe or get invested in.\n\nConclusion/Grade\n\nWhat makes Baby Driver great is that it is a unique experience and is visually stunning. Edgar Wright does a great job of blending action, suspense, romance and comedy making it one of the most enjoyable films of 2017. \n\n8.1/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":458028,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't think any movie with "Deuce Bigalow" in the title is going to claim award buzz. But there were a few belly laughs in a short 80-or-so-minute picture. The women were hot. Some were nude. And come on, you wondered how many variations of "man-whore" and "peruvian volcano" the writers could come up with. This isn't a great movie, but it was decent. And that actress who played Deuce's love interest - wow! Get her in Playboy! Six stars. No, it's probably not worth that many in the grand scheme. But for what this movie was trying to be, it deserves six. Sit back and watch while drunk/stoned. You can't beat Adam Sandler's production crew for pure gross-out humor and, of course, Rob Schneider. Whatever happened to "The Sensitive Naked Man" and "Spontaneous Orgasm Guy"? Man, if SNL only had stuff like that nowadays.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49172,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"duration":"PT1H23M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't think any movie with "Deuce Bigalow" in the title is going to claim award buzz. But there were a few belly laughs in a short 80-or-so-minute picture. The women were hot. Some were nude. And come on, you wondered how many variations of "man-whore" and "peruvian volcano" the writers could come up with. This isn't a great movie, but it was decent. And that actress who played Deuce's love interest - wow! Get her in Playboy! Six stars. No, it's probably not worth that many in the grand scheme. But for what this movie was trying to be, it deserves six. Sit back and watch while drunk/stoned. You can't beat Adam Sandler's production crew for pure gross-out humor and, of course, Rob Schneider. Whatever happened to "The Sensitive Naked Man" and "Spontaneous Orgasm Guy"? Man, if SNL only had stuff like that nowadays.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49172,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's very much grounded in the present (the present being 2016) and our reality, which I'm personally grateful for. There aren't any mustache twirling villains, mad scientists or shady billionaires (as of yet) - the characters are youthful and relatable, played by a very promising ensemble of Canadian actors. The premise is refreshingly original, utilizing the idea of souls hosting human vessels rather than the physical act of time-traveling (there's no cheesy time machines here). Grant MacLaren (played by Eric McCormack) rounds out the group as a much-needed older authoritative figure. Having seen McCormack's previous acting work I have no doubt he'll serve as a backbone for this show. "Travelers" has great potential and I look forward to seeing what it has to offer.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48128,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
