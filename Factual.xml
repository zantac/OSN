The family is determined to not tell the grandmother about her condition so as to allow her the best state of mind as she lives out the remainder of her life.\n\nTremendous performances make this film, which would not be the same achievement without the acting that makes these characters utterly real, without judging them or resorting to weepy melodrama. In addition, there is the theme of a clash of views between Asian-Americans who have learned western values and the long-standing traditional values of Chinese families. There is also a contrast in backdrops, with Awkwafina's protagonist's laid-back lifestyle at home in New York compared to the sterile, concrete character of China.\n\nAlthough the film has a comedic element with Awkwafina at the helm, this is more a slow-burn film about the psychological toll of impending family loss. It is never overdone and there are no cheap tears here. This film, in the end, earns its emotional impact. I don't cry watching a film, but I came close here. For patient viewers, this will is a must-see. Gladly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54370,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The family is determined to not tell the grandmother about her condition so as to allow her the best state of mind as she lives out the remainder of her life.\n\nTremendous performances make this film, which would not be the same achievement without the acting that makes these characters utterly real, without judging them or resorting to weepy melodrama. In addition, there is the theme of a clash of views between Asian-Americans who have learned western values and the long-standing traditional values of Chinese families. There is also a contrast in backdrops, with Awkwafina's protagonist's laid-back lifestyle at home in New York compared to the sterile, concrete character of China.\n\nAlthough the film has a comedic element with Awkwafina at the helm, this is more a slow-burn film about the psychological toll of impending family loss. It is never overdone and there are no cheap tears here. This film, in the end, earns its emotional impact. I don't cry watching a film, but I came close here. For patient viewers, this will is a must-see. Gladly recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54370,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's a take on all the recent teen horror flicks, and it does it superbly well. I hate noise in cinemas while I'm watching a film, but I couldn't keep quiet, I was laughing out loud, and I even shouted at the screen. Now I have never done that before. The gags, from one liners to the set pieces, are so funny, watch out for the sex scene and the gym teacher - I almost wet myself. This ranks next to Airplane as one of the top ten funnies.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236447,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">W laboratorium firmy farmaceutycznej stworzono wirus nowej generacji, Chimerę. Człowiek zakażony nim umiera przed upływem doby. Inna firma opracowała antidotum, jednak póki wirus się nie rozprzestrzenia, specyfik nie ma żadnej wartości. Były agent Sean Ambrose kradnie Chimerę, by odsprzedać ją tym, którzy mają na nią lekarstwo. Żąda udziałów w zyskach z produkcji leku. Komandor Swanbeck (Anthony Hopkins) zleca agentowi specjalnemu Ethanowi Huntowi (Tom Cruise) odnalezienie i zniszczenie wszystkich istniejących próbek wirusa. Hunt werbuje do współpracy złodziejkę Nyah (Thandie Newton), byłą kochankę Seana. Ma ona być wtyczką w ekipie Ambrose'a. Niestety, przestępca dowiaduje się o planach agenta i jego znajomości z Nyah. Ethan zostaje zaatakowany w laboratorium, gdy niszczy próbki wirusa. Ostatnią z nich zostaje zarażona Nyah. Teraz Ambrose zamierza wykorzystać dziewczynę jako żywą bombę biologiczną - chce porzucić ją w centrum miasta, aby doprowadzić do wybuchu epidemii. Hunt musi zdobyć antidotum i podać je chorej, zanim będzie za późno. Pomaga mu genialny haker Luther (Ving Rhames).</desc>

Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill make a great bromance couple, and although appearing in the disappointing "Ride Along", Ice Cube too is brilliant in this film.\n\nExpect non-stop entertainment as excellent humour is mixed with an interesting yet simple plot, heartfelt moments and exciting action. My only complaint would be that at times it felt a little recycled from the first film. Though having enjoyed that I wasn't too fussed. \n\nMore than worth your moneys worth. If you enjoyed 21 Jump Street, then you'd be mad not to see this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":351646,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And, overall, I liked it.\n\nI never watched "Angel" so I have no problem with seeing David Boreanaz in this new role. I thought he was a very good choice for the part. I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning. I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints". The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning.

The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And, overall, I liked it.\n\nI never watched "Angel" so I have no problem with seeing David Boreanaz in this new role. I thought he was a very good choice for the part. I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning. I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints". The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And, overall, I liked it.\n\nI never watched "Angel" so I have no problem with seeing David Boreanaz in this new role. I thought he was a very good choice for the part. I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning. I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints". The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack. I think "CSI" started this trend of having a song here and there, but these songs should at least fit what we're watching, or, as Tarantino is so skilled at doing, lend an artistic contrast to the scene.\n\nI think they also need to take a little more time refining the dramatic parts of the show lest they continue to come off in a corny way.\n\nBased on just the Pilot, however, I give the show 3 out of 4 stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Scott has also assembled a truly great cast that includes household names like Neeson and Irons alongside very effective character actors like Norton , Glen , Thewlis , Sheen and Gleeson . It must have been something of a gamble for Scott to cast pretty boy Bloom in the lead role since he's the sort of " movie star " who's only famous because of his good looks rather than any outstanding thespian ability but Orlando Bloom probably gives his greatest performance in this film .

Because of this, I assumed I also would love the movie. Sadly, however, I was left feeling ambivalent about it...and I noticed that my wife and oldest daughter felt pretty much the same way.\n\nI won't talk about the plot...after all, there's a summary on IMDB and lots of reviews talk about this. What I should mention is that the film is much more like the book than previous versions....a plus. But the reasons I still did not love this film are what stop me from recommending the film. First, there simply is too much story to cram into a little over two hours. If you are going to try to stick closer to the book, then perhaps consider making it a mini-series. This is because although the film is more like the book, to do this they also omit a lot of things....making the story seem a bit disjoint and confusing. Second, I really didn't think they did a good job of helping the viewers to actually care about the characters. Some of this was because the little women in the story were poorly chosen--much too old in some cases (the 12 year-old early in the story looked to be about 20). Some was because the choppiness of the story really harmed the film because the characters just seemed one-dimensional. Overall, a decent story but even with its sticking closer to the book, I much preferred the 1990s version...which was much more charming, fun and likable.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":155353,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Because of this, I assumed I also would love the movie. Sadly, however, I was left feeling ambivalent about it...and I noticed that my wife and oldest daughter felt pretty much the same way.\n\nI won't talk about the plot...after all, there's a summary on IMDB and lots of reviews talk about this. What I should mention is that the film is much more like the book than previous versions....a plus. But the reasons I still did not love this film are what stop me from recommending the film. First, there simply is too much story to cram into a little over two hours. If you are going to try to stick closer to the book, then perhaps consider making it a mini-series. This is because although the film is more like the book, to do this they also omit a lot of things....making the story seem a bit disjoint and confusing. Second, I really didn't think they did a good job of helping the viewers to actually care about the characters. Some of this was because the little women in the story were poorly chosen--much too old in some cases (the 12 year-old early in the story looked to be about 20). Some was because the choppiness of the story really harmed the film because the characters just seemed one-dimensional. Overall, a decent story but even with its sticking closer to the book, I much preferred the 1990s version...which was much more charming, fun and likable.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":155353,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"duration":"PT2H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Go beyond Up, and make a complete movie that was as beautiful as the first 20 minutes of Wall-E.\n\nI got my wish. \n\nThis is the movie I wanted Pixar to make, once again. A movie about what family means. A movie about the choices we make, and the roads not taken. \n\nThis is a stunning work of art. It'll move you from happiness to tears, from memories of the past to the joy of the future. To understanding, to remembrance. To the joys and pains of being alive.\n\nI can't even begin to imagine how Pixar made a movie about life and death that is so colorful, so absorbing, so poignant, and so approachable for kids, and with so many layers upon layers upon layers of meaning and significance for adults.\n\nTo watch Coco is to love Coco, and to remember the Cocos in your life that are no longer among us.\n\nThank you, Pixar.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":408563,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I thought it would be a simple, sexy, scandalous story full of clichés; instead I found myself more and more drawn to a deeper, psychologically complex drama that perfectly illustrates how there are three sides to each story: his version, her version, and the truth. Expect solid performance, melancholic scenery, careful art direction, and excellent choice of costumes as per each character's persona. \n\nOh and you have got to love the opening theme performed by Fiona Apple.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41554,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I thought it would be a simple, sexy, scandalous story full of clichés; instead I found myself more and more drawn to a deeper, psychologically complex drama that perfectly illustrates how there are three sides to each story: his version, her version, and the truth. Expect solid performance, melancholic scenery, careful art direction, and excellent choice of costumes as per each character's persona. \n\nOh and you have got to love the opening theme performed by Fiona Apple.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41554,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I don't ever really think about cinematography- I go into a movie, watch it, and don't think much about the filming style. But in this movie the filming style is so bad that it's distracting. The entire movie is very dark- yes for some unknown reason it's all in the dark. Even the daytime scenes everyone is shrouded in shadows. So that kinda sucks. And then also all the conversations in this movie seem to be shot in profile. We only ever see the sides of people's faces. I'd love to get just one shot of someone's entire face. Like an actual face, with eyes, that is well lit, that would be great. But you're not gonna get that in this movie! You're actually not going to see an entire head in almost any scene. All the heads will be either from very far away or very close up so you'll see from the neck to the eyebrows only but not the actual top of anyone's heads and NEVER the front of their face- only the profile! I'm not even going to comment on the plot it's kinda bla or whatever but I'm halfway through the movie while writing this and just looking at this dark and terrible filming style. As I'm writing this Im also thinking, "Am I exaggerating?" But no I am not because every single time I glance up at the screen I see close ups of people's side profiles in shadow. Every scene. I don't need to keep seeing Shailene Woodley's ears. Also Jamie Dornan is a gorgeous man and we never actually get to see a shot of his whole face this entire frickin movie! Why even have someone so gorgeous in so many scenes and only show bits of pieces of face? Why is the cinematographer doing this to us? Whyyyy?!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't ever really think about cinematography- I go into a movie, watch it, and don't think much about the filming style. But in this movie the filming style is so bad that it's distracting. The entire movie is very dark- yes for some unknown reason it's all in the dark. Even the daytime scenes everyone is shrouded in shadows. So that kinda sucks. And then also all the conversations in this movie seem to be shot in profile. We only ever see the sides of people's faces. I'd love to get just one shot of someone's entire face. Like an actual face, with eyes, that is well lit, that would be great. But you're not gonna get that in this movie! You're actually not going to see an entire head in almost any scene. All the heads will be either from very far away or very close up so you'll see from the neck to the eyebrows only but not the actual top of anyone's heads and NEVER the front of their face- only the profile! I'm not even going to comment on the plot it's kinda bla or whatever but I'm halfway through the movie while writing this and just looking at this dark and terrible filming style. As I'm writing this Im also thinking, "Am I exaggerating?" But no I am not because every single time I glance up at the screen I see close ups of people's side profiles in shadow. Every scene. I don't need to keep seeing Shailene Woodley's ears. Also Jamie Dornan is a gorgeous man and we never actually get to see a shot of his whole face this entire frickin movie! Why even have someone so gorgeous in so many scenes and only show bits of pieces of face? Why is the cinematographer doing this to us? Whyyyy?!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Flash benefits from not having boring main characters (I'm looking at you Hawkman/Hawkgirl, and Arrow's terrible Laurel Lance).

So-so!","reviewBody":"The pilot episode sets forth the promising tale of a motley crew destined for greatness on a romp through time and space. And, for the most part, it succeeds at continuing a trend of mostly-good DC Superhero TV on the CW. Helped along by several characters that have earned us caring about them from their development on Arrow and The Flash, Victor Garber's Martin Stein, Caity Lotz's Sarah Lance, and Brandon Routh's Ray Palmer ground the show with enough heart to kick-start it into action.\n\nMeanwhile, Snart and Rory continue to play the well characterized pair of funny anti-heroes that we have seen again and again on the other CW shows. In particular, Captain Cold's absurdly dry sense of humor and knack for puns cuts through moments of necessary pilot exposition.\n\nThe real standout, though, is Arthur Darvill as Rip Hunter, whose sharp comedic timing and deeper acting chops should help keep the show grounded in a strong protagonist moving forward. The more Legends of Tomorrow leans on Darvill and Garber for dramatic story lines, the better.\n\nUnfortunately, not all of the characters on the team are well-developed or well-acted. Hawkman and Hawkgirl continue to be as trite and uninteresting as they were during their stint on The Flash. And despite the potential in Vandal Savage as a character, his writing thus far has not been nuanced or compelling enough to set him on par with CW's other seasonal "Big Bads".\n\nMoving forward, the show should succeed if it focuses on its characters and actors that elevate it above mere comic book cheese, and if it executes its promise of time-travel shenanigans in inventive, fun ways.\n\nLegends of Tomorrow doesn't look poised to knock The Flash from its "best in DC" throne just yet. The Flash benefits from not having boring main characters (I'm looking at you Hawkman/Hawkgirl, and Arrow's terrible Laurel Lance). Consistency will be Legends of Tomorrow's biggest challenge if it wants to one-up The Flash and legitimize future expansion of CW's DC Universe. 5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So-so!","reviewBody":"The pilot episode sets forth the promising tale of a motley crew destined for greatness on a romp through time and space. And, for the most part, it succeeds at continuing a trend of mostly-good DC Superhero TV on the CW. Helped along by several characters that have earned us caring about them from their development on Arrow and The Flash, Victor Garber's Martin Stein, Caity Lotz's Sarah Lance, and Brandon Routh's Ray Palmer ground the show with enough heart to kick-start it into action.\n\nMeanwhile, Snart and Rory continue to play the well characterized pair of funny anti-heroes that we have seen again and again on the other CW shows. In particular, Captain Cold's absurdly dry sense of humor and knack for puns cuts through moments of necessary pilot exposition.\n\nThe real standout, though, is Arthur Darvill as Rip Hunter, whose sharp comedic timing and deeper acting chops should help keep the show grounded in a strong protagonist moving forward. The more Legends of Tomorrow leans on Darvill and Garber for dramatic story lines, the better.\n\nUnfortunately, not all of the characters on the team are well-developed or well-acted. Hawkman and Hawkgirl continue to be as trite and uninteresting as they were during their stint on The Flash. And despite the potential in Vandal Savage as a character, his writing thus far has not been nuanced or compelling enough to set him on par with CW's other seasonal "Big Bads".\n\nMoving forward, the show should succeed if it focuses on its characters and actors that elevate it above mere comic book cheese, and if it executes its promise of time-travel shenanigans in inventive, fun ways.\n\nLegends of Tomorrow doesn't look poised to knock The Flash from its "best in DC" throne just yet. The Flash benefits from not having boring main characters (I'm looking at you Hawkman/Hawkgirl, and Arrow's terrible Laurel Lance). Consistency will be Legends of Tomorrow's biggest challenge if it wants to one-up The Flash and legitimize future expansion of CW's DC Universe. 5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You play as Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover in the first movie) who, after being rescued by Jigsaw from the catacombs outside the infamous bathroom is thrown into a gauntlet of his own in an abandoned asylum where he has to rescue a handful of people from gruesome deaths.\n\nIt reminded me a lot of Condemned 2: Bloodshot but was nowhere near as terrifying, but it gets points for trying, as you stumble around in dark, decrepit buildings unsure of what is around the corner. It's a fairly easy game, with an easy-going learning curve. Common sense and memory tricks will see you through every trap safely, and it's good to see some closure on the story of Detective Tapp (apparently the game IS canon), but the twist at the end is lame and there's no 'Final Zepp'. Instead the game just offers generic muzak that's hardly as effective.\n\nIt's an easy Platinum, with many bronze and silvers given away like they were free. You won't be playing it for more than a week, but still worth it.\n\nGraphics C+ Sound B- Gameplay B Lasting Appeal C+"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":716,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You play as Detective David Tapp (Danny Glover in the first movie) who, after being rescued by Jigsaw from the catacombs outside the infamous bathroom is thrown into a gauntlet of his own in an abandoned asylum where he has to rescue a handful of people from gruesome deaths.\n\nIt reminded me a lot of Condemned 2: Bloodshot but was nowhere near as terrifying, but it gets points for trying, as you stumble around in dark, decrepit buildings unsure of what is around the corner. It's a fairly easy game, with an easy-going learning curve. Common sense and memory tricks will see you through every trap safely, and it's good to see some closure on the story of Detective Tapp (apparently the game IS canon), but the twist at the end is lame and there's no 'Final Zepp'. Instead the game just offers generic muzak that's hardly as effective.\n\nIt's an easy Platinum, with many bronze and silvers given away like they were free. You won't be playing it for more than a week, but still worth it.\n\nGraphics C+ Sound B- Gameplay B Lasting Appeal C+","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":716,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="pl">II koncert na wiolonczelę i orkiestrę</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Maciek Gasik (Piotr Kramer) pracuje jako okulista, a jego pasją jest muzyka. Razem ze swoim zespołem często koncertuje. W trakcie jednego z takich występów dochodzi do tragedii; Maciek doznaje udaru mózgu. Lekarzom udaje się ocalić mu życie, ale młody mężczyzna staje się więźniem własnego ciała. Załamany długo nie potrafi odnaleźć się w nowej rzeczywistości, w której jest całkowicie zależny od innych ludzi. Postanawia się jednak nie poddawać i zawalczyć o swoją godność i wolność. Film na podstawie prawdziwej historii przedstawionej w reportażu Małgorzaty Smolak. Scenariusz stworzono do koncertu wiolonczelowego autorstwa Pawła Mykietyna.</desc>

Nagły wypadek, którego ofiarą staje się jeden z ukraińskich robotników, wystawia zasady moralne Krzysztofa na próbę.

Szybko okazuje się, że podróż autostopem nie jest tak ekscytująca, jak się wydawało, kiedy znajduje się w środku nocy na obrzeżach postkomunistycznego miasta. Dziewczyna dostrzega na moście postać, która niebezpiecznie balansuje na barierce. Tak poznaje niezrównoważonego dziwaka Chudego. Oboje postanawiają na jakiś czas obrać taki sam kierunek podróży. Pod osłoną nocy snują się po mieście, w coraz dziwniejsze rejony, doświadczając niezwykłych emocji. Wkrótce między Młodą a Chudym tworzy się nienazwana więź. Całość oparta jest na płaszczyźnie psychodelicznej jak z narkotycznego transu.</desc>

Nagły wypadek, którego ofiarą staje się jeden z ukraińskich robotników, wystawia zasady moralne Krzysztofa na próbę.

Szybko okazuje się, że podróż autostopem nie jest tak ekscytująca, jak się wydawało, kiedy znajduje się w środku nocy na obrzeżach postkomunistycznego miasta. Dziewczyna dostrzega na moście postać, która niebezpiecznie balansuje na barierce. Tak poznaje niezrównoważonego dziwaka Chudego. Oboje postanawiają na jakiś czas obrać taki sam kierunek podróży. Pod osłoną nocy snują się po mieście, w coraz dziwniejsze rejony, doświadczając niezwykłych emocji. Wkrótce między Młodą a Chudym tworzy się nienazwana więź. Całość oparta jest na płaszczyźnie psychodelicznej jak z narkotycznego transu.</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Tata</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Członkowie dwupokoleniowej rodziny próbują żyć ze świadomością o jej rozpadzie. Niektórzy starają się to akceptować i trwać w takiej rzeczywistości, a inni chcą się z niej wydostać. Liczne problemy, rozpadające się związki i rozwody negatywnie wpływają na stosunki międzyludzkie. Wszystko to odbija się na dzieciach, które w ten sposób tracą szansę na normalny rozwój. Przedstawiana historia widziana jest z perspektywy małego dziecka, obserwującego zachowania swoich rodziców. Rozgrywający się dramat ojca Janusza (Grzegorz Juchiewicz) uwidacznia bezsilność w bezwiednie zapoczątkowanej autodestrukcji.</desc>

Far more than your average revenge movie, Considine elevates it into a terrifying area, electrifying every frame he is in. You will laugh at the drug dealer's talk of porn and "al fresco" - but the minute Considine enters, the laughter stops. Totally believable, and the drug dealers (Gary Stretch and others) are fantastic support too. \n\nThe story is not as developed as I hoped it would've been, sometimes creating frustrating anti-climaxes here and there, but this is only a minor problem. The killings are well thought out, scary and well paced throughout. The plot, although simple (initially) does become a more twisted prospect towards the end - so it is a highly rewarding movie. Being only 86 minutes long helps a lot too, as the movie runs at a brisk pace, just right for it's genre.\n\nAlong with Get Carter, this is one of the best revenge films, and one of the best thrillers to come out of the U.K. The cinematography is bluntly physical and realistic, the music well implemented and the acting spot on. To add variety, the movie adds dark humour to create a great film. People who are expecting a blood-fuelled rampage of retribution ala Kill Bill will be disappointed. Dead Man's Shoes is an expertly delivered thriller, with subtle tension and great performances.\n\nWell worth a watch.\n\n8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50488,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Totally believable, and the drug dealers (Gary Stretch and others) are fantastic support too. \n\nThe story is not as developed as I hoped it would've been, sometimes creating frustrating anti-climaxes here and there, but this is only a minor problem. The killings are well thought out, scary and well paced throughout. The plot, although simple (initially) does become a more twisted prospect towards the end - so it is a highly rewarding movie. Being only 86 minutes long helps a lot too, as the movie runs at a brisk pace, just right for it's genre.\n\nAlong with Get Carter, this is one of the best revenge films, and one of the best thrillers to come out of the U.K. The cinematography is bluntly physical and realistic, the music well implemented and the acting spot on. To add variety, the movie adds dark humour to create a great film. People who are expecting a blood-fuelled rampage of retribution ala Kill Bill will be disappointed. Dead Man's Shoes is an expertly delivered thriller, with subtle tension and great performances.\n\nWell worth a watch.\n\n8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50488,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was expecting him to be a lead character, but he's not.\n\nSo, in conclusion, if you have never seen Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels, I would see that first before seeing Snatch so you can get adjusted to Guy Richie's style.  I still think that it is stupid to compare either two movies to Pulp Fiction (unlike most people), but it is in the same ballpark as Pulp.  That means if you liked Pulp, you will most likely like Snatch and Lock, Stock.  If you have never seen Pulp or Lock Stock, you have deprived your life of culture.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":796415,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And, overall, I liked it.\n\nI never watched "Angel" so I have no problem with seeing David Boreanaz in this new role. I thought he was a very good choice for the part. I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning. I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints". The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments.

And, overall, I liked it.\n\nI never watched "Angel" so I have no problem with seeing David Boreanaz in this new role. I thought he was a very good choice for the part. I also liked Emily Deschanel, once I warmed up to her style. They seemed to try too hard to introduce her as a real tough girl in the beginning. I think she pulls off being a tough girl and being a bit flaky, especially in social situations, at the same time. Her dialogue reminds of the way some girls I know talk, which might be why I got such a kick out of it.\n\nThe supporting cast is a likable group of "squints". The chick, well--they're gonna have to be real careful that she doesn't become annoying, or else I'm gonna start rooting for her to be killed off much the way I root for the demises of characters on "CSI: Miami"--yet they keep taking out the good ones.\n\nThe dialogue is crisp and funny, with some nice insightful moments. The tone is dark like other shows of its kind, but I like how they didn't rely on the gore-factor. I think they dealt with the crime committed in a respectful way. As for the hologram computer program, I think it's a cool ingredient--such a thing isn't so sci-fi anymore, but is still amply cool to see.\n\nNow, for the negatives (other than the sidekick chick): I hate the seemingly random pop-song soundtrack.

Ever since Jaws, they've been depicted as greedy Capitalist entrepreneurs that readily ignore the sensible advice of the scientist/cop/journalist/sexy teens who know about the rapidly approaching ferocious monster(s) for the sake of chasing those delicious American dollars. Call it crazy, but I've always felt a twinge of sympathy for them, they are just trying to do their jobs and protects local economic interests at a time of tremendous cultural importance. However, none have tugged at my heart strings quite like the Mayor in this film.\n\nHere is a man who we are supposed to despise, but when we first meet him, he is asking the hero (an insect specialist this time around) how the job of solving the mosquito problem is going. Rather than saying "yeah, I've killed them all with my fancy insect-specialist stuff," the response is more along the lines of: "well, I'm bringing thousands more mosquito's into the neighbouring countryside. Oh, and some bats too." The movie then expects us an audience to condemn the mayor when he makes the logical step of firing the man, enchanting though his eyes may be and telling him to get out of town. All because he's fat, wearing a designer shirt and smoking a cigar. Lousy successful people! How dare they occupy positions of office! \n\nFast forward about twenty five minutes and the Mayor now has the town's police chief sat before him. When asked whether the previously mentioned insect specialist has been thrown out of town, the sheriff doesn't say: "yes of course mayor, he's well on his way to the border." No, instead, the reply this time is more like: "no, actually I've been hanging out with him for the past few hours and done nothing but blow up the city morgue because it had a bit of a wasp problem." Just like before, we are expected to applaud this decision and cheer on the honest lawman for not giving in to the reasonable demands made of him. But surely shelling out for a can of Raid would do? \n\nFast forward even more and for the third time in the movie, we are expected to condone the mayor. The reason this time? Simple, a large group of men in military uniforms have turned up with a very polite man and lots of expensive looking equipment, claiming to be from an environmental protection agency. Yet again, the mayor tells the good natured old sheriff to deal with the rugged hero. He's a loose cannon! A wild card! For all we know, he could be siding with the bees! From the tone of the scene, it's quite obvious that we should be shaking our fists with rage at the mayor's foolish decisions but let's be fair now...the only reason he's willing to trust this new group is because they look like professionals, act like professionals, haven't blown up any of the town and haven't said "actually, we're here to carry out an evil plan." Needless to say then, this is not a great movie when it comes to even-handed depictions of public officials. Though to be honest now, films about swarms of killer bees which have remote Guatemalan tribesmen speaking fluent Castellan Spanish probably didn't spend much time on the script. "The Deadly Swarm" is a terrible movie, the only reason I'm giving it two stars is because at one bit, a UFO nut starts firing a shotgun wildly into the swarm while shouting "Nobody's probing my rectum!"

    <title lang="pl">Mr. Jones</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Robotnik budowlany Jones (Richard Gere) jest inteligentnym i przystojnym mężczyzną. Dzięki urokowi osobistemu potrafi zjednywać sobie ludzi. Cierpi jednak na psychozę maniakalno-depresyjną. Objawia się ona przemiennymi napadami głębokiej depresji i euforii. Gdy pewnego dnia podczas pracy na wysokości mężczyzna naraża na niebezpieczeństwo siebie i swoich współpracowników, trafia do szpitala psychiatrycznego. Dostaje się pod opiekę doktor Elizabeth Bowen (Lena Olin). Lekarka czuje się bezradna wobec stanu Jonesa, gdyż nie do końca wiadomo, co jest jego przyczyną. Nie ma też pojęcia, jakie leczenie zastosować. Chory coraz bardziej ją intryguje. Z czasem ich przyjaźń przeradza się w fascynację, a później głębokie uczucie. Zostają kochankami. Elizabeth ryzykuje tym związkiem swoją karierę. Zwierza się koledze ze szpitala, Patrickowi (Tom Irwin). Jej podopieczny zostaje przeniesiony do innego zakładu, skąd niebawem ucieka. Kobieta rezygnuje z dalszej praktyki, by go odnaleźć. Opowieść o miłości, w imię której łamie się wszelkie konwenanse. Współautorem scenariusza filmu jest Eric Roth, laureat Oscara za "Forresta Gumpa".</desc>

The bickering couple end up stranded outside a small service station in the middle of nowhere, and decide to to check into the Pinewood motel, a cheap little place for them to spend the night until they can get help the next morning. The quirky desk clerk gives them their room, and they find it to be a complete dump. But their dingy motel room is the least of their problems, when they find videotapes of homemade snuff movies where previous guests were filmed as they were brutally murdered. With a team of masked killers surrounding the entire motel, and every area under surveillance, Amy and David find themselves in a life-or-death struggle as they try and survive through the night.\n\nIf the plot summary for this movie sounds like something that interests you, you will more than likely enjoy this suspenseful horror flick. I went into "Vacancy" with pretty average expectations - I wasn't that wild about this movie when I'd first heard about it, but it sounded interesting enough so I decided to give it a try, and I'm glad I did. Unlike the vast majority of the horror junk that gets released lately, this film actually boasts an original and solidly-constructed premise. Take some elements from Hitchock's "Psycho" (was it just me, or were those opening credits played over with the Bernard Herrman-like score a direct reference to Hitchcock?), throw in some aspects from the "Saw" series, and tie things together in a tense little package, and you get "Vacancy". I was literally on the edge of my seat throughout almost the entire film, and found not one dull moment. Suspense and tension are the real kickers in this movie, and it is done very well. Lots of moody camera angles and some genuinely frightening sequences (take the underground cave scenes for example) add to the tense nature.\n\nOur lead performers are Beckinsale and Wilson, both of whom turn in some great performances. Wilson plays the "husband hero" and Beckinsale is the "damsel in distress-gone fighting machine", and both capture this effectively. Their acting is believable, and I think that the writing has something to do with it as well, because their characters are written really well. They're not your typical genre morons who drop to the floor when the killer approaches, they are much more real. They make good decisions and the right moves, which makes them much more credible and realistic, winning over the audiences sympathy rather easily. There were some heart-pumping fight sequences as well between the heroes and the villains, which were well executed and had you rooting for Beckinsale and Wilson. The ending was a little uneven I have to admit, but compared to the tense hour and twenty-five minutes before it, it doesn't come close to bringing the movie down.\n\nOverall, "Vacancy" is an original horror flick that is heavy on suspense, while not so heavy on bloodshed. The claustrophobic atmosphere and the tense build up in this movie is it's real charm, and it will have you on the edge of your seat, anxious to see what will happen next. It's the way a thriller should be done, and makes for an enjoyable late-night fright fest. Exceeded my expectations and went beyond. 9/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95634,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Simon Pegg plays Jack, a 40 year old divorced man who has planned a blind date with a 24 year old girl. Lake Bell plays the 34 year old Nancy who is taking the train home to her parents wedding anniversary. Nancy accidentally meet Jack's blind date and switch places with her when she discovers that the girl forgot her book, the one thing she needed to bring to the date. Jack is totally unaware of the switch and immediately takes Nancy, the wrong girl, out on the streets of London.\n\nMan Up is definitely among the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. With a farce like humor and a perfect timing in editing and story, the film rushes away with the speed of a car chase. Nancy is at first forced to lie to Jack so that he doesn't suspect anything and he also deliberately hides his past to avoid looking foolish. After a while as the film goes on they both discover that they are very alike. Willingly and unwillingly they expose their best and worst sides of themselves for each other. It becomes some sort of race between them, a race impossible to win.\n\nWe are thrown out into London's night life with bowling, bars and portable restaurants. In some way the director is able to catch the characters' many sides in a very short time. At the same time every location they visit, plays a big part for the whole picture. They both encounter people from their past, each one affecting their date positively and negatively. Do not miss the very funny London taxi vs bike race between them. It is a very quick and incredibly refreshing romantic comedy after a couple of years with pretty lame and mediocre films in the same genre. I almost thought that the romcom film had died out, but here we actually get proof that it still works. Come on, more films like this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49712,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

","datePublished":"2015-05-29","description":"A single woman takes the place of a stranger's blind date, which leads to her finding the perfect boyfriend.","keywords":"blind date,single woman,stranger,one day,seduction","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt3064298/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"DavidLindahl","dateCreated":"2016-05-29","inLanguage":"English","name":"One of the better romantic comedies in years","reviewBody":"Man Up is a British romantic comedy about a man and a woman who meets on a blind date. Simon Pegg plays Jack, a 40 year old divorced man who has planned a blind date with a 24 year old girl. Lake Bell plays the 34 year old Nancy who is taking the train home to her parents wedding anniversary. Nancy accidentally meet Jack's blind date and switch places with her when she discovers that the girl forgot her book, the one thing she needed to bring to the date. Jack is totally unaware of the switch and immediately takes Nancy, the wrong girl, out on the streets of London.\n\nMan Up is definitely among the best romantic comedies I've seen in a long time. With a farce like humor and a perfect timing in editing and story, the film rushes away with the speed of a car chase. Nancy is at first forced to lie to Jack so that he doesn't suspect anything and he also deliberately hides his past to avoid looking foolish. After a while as the film goes on they both discover that they are very alike. Willingly and unwillingly they expose their best and worst sides of themselves for each other. It becomes some sort of race between them, a race impossible to win.\n\nWe are thrown out into London's night life with bowling, bars and portable restaurants. In some way the director is able to catch the characters' many sides in a very short time. At the same time every location they visit, plays a big part for the whole picture. They both encounter people from their past, each one affecting their date positively and negatively. Do not miss the very funny London taxi vs bike race between them. It is a very quick and incredibly refreshing romantic comedy after a couple of years with pretty lame and mediocre films in the same genre. I almost thought that the romcom film had died out, but here we actually get proof that it still works. Come on, more films like this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49712,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

W pociągu zmierzającym do Wenecji dosiada się do niego Elise Clifton-Ward. Trudno mu oderwać oczy od pełnej dystyngowanego piękna kobiety. Wkrótce okazuje się, że nie pojawiła się ona na jego drodze przypadkowo. Elise była kochanką Alexandra Pearce'a - geniusza przestępczości finansowej. Pewnego dnia ukradł on wielkie pieniądze wpływowemu gangsterowi, co w półświatku jest równoznaczne z wydaniem na siebie wyroku śmierci. Co więcej, szukają go brytyjscy agenci z inspektorem Achesonem na czele. W środowisku od jakiegoś czasu krążą pogłoski, że Pearce zmienił twarz i ukrył się gdzieś w Europie. Frank zostaje wplątany w międzynarodową intrygę i trafia w środek wojny między rosyjską mafią a wspieraną przez Interpol policją. Nie ma pojęcia, że Elise chce go wykorzystać jako przynętę w prowadzonej przez siebie grze. Życie turysty jest w niebezpieczeństwie. Nie potrafi on jednak oprzeć się kobiecie i brnie w coraz poważniejsze tarapaty.</desc>

The title comes from the youngest daughter misnaming her father's condition as "polar bear" - thematically relevant as the overall film is about the two girls learning to accept their father's behaviour beyond their own preconceptions, appreciating what he does do well. From such a description, the film might sound overly sweet, and in a way it is, only ever seeming to skim the surface, focusing only on how embarrassed the girls are by their father's inability to integrate into society. There are a couple of moments in which the girls genuinely seem afraid of what their father might do, but the film never tugs at the full experience of living with someone with mental issues; as others have said, Mark Ruffalo comes off as more an everyday eccentric than a manic depressive. That said, Ruffalo's performance is the film's best asset, frequently communicating a genuine interest to bond with his daughters and care for them in small, subtle ways. His facial expressions and movements convey more than his dialogue and it is easy to feel for his frustration at not being able to be everything that his daughters want. It is much harder to reconcile the film's blanket negative attitude to the US public school system throughout, but it does act as an acceptable symbol of all that the girls' parents are worried about, and the film does offer an acute portrait of parents doing what they can for their offspring, even if it falls short in other areas.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15384,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The title comes from the youngest daughter misnaming her father's condition as "polar bear" - thematically relevant as the overall film is about the two girls learning to accept their father's behaviour beyond their own preconceptions, appreciating what he does do well. From such a description, the film might sound overly sweet, and in a way it is, only ever seeming to skim the surface, focusing only on how embarrassed the girls are by their father's inability to integrate into society. There are a couple of moments in which the girls genuinely seem afraid of what their father might do, but the film never tugs at the full experience of living with someone with mental issues; as others have said, Mark Ruffalo comes off as more an everyday eccentric than a manic depressive.
