It is provocative, introspective, hopeful, and at times downright desolate. As evidenced by the opening sequence, the value of life itself is called into question and it sets the tone for the rest of the film.\n\nThe complex storyline focuses on one day in the lives of three women from three different generations.  Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is living outside of London with her husband in 1923, recovering from mental illness and beginning work on her now famous novel, Mrs. Dalloway.  Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a 1950's suburban housewife, married to a World War II veteran (John C. Reilly), raising a small boy while expecting another child. And then there is Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep), a present-day version of Mrs. Dalloway, so named by her one-time lover and now AIDS-stricken writer Richard (Ed Harris), living in New York and planning one of her renowned parties for him following his reception of a prestigious poetry award.\n\n Yet there is a common thread among them that effaces any 'real' normalcy in their lives and ultimately forces each of them to make life-altering decisions.  Themes revolving around feminism and sexual preference stir just below the surface.  But it is the prevailing sadness of these women brought on by the confinements of a restrictive and often stifling society that is at the core of this film. Their yearning for something more or for that 'one perfect moment' in time places each of them in the painful position to question their own existence.  The sequences in each of their lives are carefully interwoven throughout the movie, enhancing their parallel struggles.\n\nThe Hours is skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and contains some of the finest performances of the year.  Julianne Moore's depiction of Laura Brown is filled with subtlety and nuance.  She epitomizes a 1950's housewife with a constant shiny exterior who can barely contain the internal struggle of her life's claustrophobic confinements.  Meryl Streep's Clarissa Vaughn, though bound by memories of her past, is somewhat less restricted in her character as a modern New York editor living with her female lover and therefore has more opportunity to display her considerable emotional range.\n\nHowever it is Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf that is the most mesmerizing and transforming performance in the film.  She is completely submerged as the famous novelist of the early twentieth century.  The hype concerning Kidman's prosthetic proboscis and its alleged distraction is much ado about nothing.  To the contrary, it enhances her performance and allows her characterization of Virginia Woolf to fully emerge.  Audiences will not recognize her, nor should they.\n\nBut if it is familiar players and plotlines you are seeking then The Hours is not for you.  It is neither fantasy nor escapism, yet what it lacks in pure entertainment it makes up for with introspection and a somewhat hopeful ending.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":126477,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I say B+","reviewBody":""The most performed playwright of all time, the author of 37 plays, 154 sonnets &amp; several narrative poems...and yet not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in Shakespeare's own hand." A movie that explores the theory that Shakespeare didn't write any of the things that he is said to. The theory is that The Earl of Oxford (Ifans) wrote them all as a stab at the new Queen (Redgrave) of England. I have said this before but I am not a Shakespeare fan at all, I just don't get him. There are a few movies of his I like but for the most part I am not a fan. Needless to say before watching this I was not that excited at all. Almost instantly the movie grabbed me and I was hooked. For those like me this is not really about Shakespeare at all, but more of a political thriller about trying to start and control a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth I in the 1600's. Weather this is true or not to me doesn't matter but the idea of writing plays as a way to begin a rebellion is a very interesting theory and makes for a very interesting movie. Overall, (from a non-Shakespeare fan) I really enjoyed this movie and recommend this. I give it a B+.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39575,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I really liked this movie. I say B+","reviewBody":""The most performed playwright of all time, the author of 37 plays, 154 sonnets &amp; several narrative poems...and yet not a single manuscript of any kind has ever been found written in Shakespeare's own hand." A movie that explores the theory that Shakespeare didn't write any of the things that he is said to. The theory is that The Earl of Oxford (Ifans) wrote them all as a stab at the new Queen (Redgrave) of England. I have said this before but I am not a Shakespeare fan at all, I just don't get him. There are a few movies of his I like but for the most part I am not a fan. Needless to say before watching this I was not that excited at all. Almost instantly the movie grabbed me and I was hooked. For those like me this is not really about Shakespeare at all, but more of a political thriller about trying to start and control a rebellion against Queen Elizabeth I in the 1600's. Weather this is true or not to me doesn't matter but the idea of writing plays as a way to begin a rebellion is a very interesting theory and makes for a very interesting movie. Overall, (from a non-Shakespeare fan) I really enjoyed this movie and recommend this. I give it a B+.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39575,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Liked what felt like some fairly realistic situations, hope they give the chance.\n\nLoved seeing Eamonn Walker. he was a favorite actor I hope they give him a good chance to shine.\n\nMy only concern with an ensemble cast is not getting enough character development and interest to keep the show going at the beginning before it gets to sink in and develop a stable audience.\n\nAnd really enjoyed seeing something set in somewhere other than New York or Los Angeles!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41254,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Really enjoyed the show, we found it exciting, fast paced, without too much exposition or clumsy explaining. Liked what felt like some fairly realistic situations, hope they give the chance.\n\nLoved seeing Eamonn Walker. he was a favorite actor I hope they give him a good chance to shine.\n\nMy only concern with an ensemble cast is not getting enough character development and interest to keep the show going at the beginning before it gets to sink in and develop a stable audience.\n\nAnd really enjoyed seeing something set in somewhere other than New York or Los Angeles!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41254,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I have not read the novel (even though I plan to do it now) so I'm only offering my views on the movie.\n\nFirst of all: It's amazingly beautiful. The costumes and sets are gorgeous, the cinematography is exquisite, the animals are cute (especially Rosie the elephant) and the three leads are very easy on the eyes as well. \n\nRobert Pattinson was actually quite good. This was a surprise to me, since I didn't really think he was anything special in any of the Twilight movies or "Remember Me". He looked very appropriate for the time the movie was set in, and even though I love Emile Hirsch (who auditioned for Jacob too) I'm confident that Robert was the best choice there was for this role, it was perfect for him. Hal Holbrook was also very fitting for the role of older Jacob. The two actors really made me believe that they were the same person in different stages of his life.\n\nReese Witherspoon was okay. She looked beautiful, was charming and cute but it felt like something was missing - however, I can't think of any other actress I would have liked better in the role, so I came to the conclusion that it was probably the character Marlena that was a little bland, not Reese. \n\nBut the true star of this movie was Christoph Waltz. I may be a bit biased since I loved him in "Inglorious Basterds", but he was even more perfect in this movie. His portrayal of August was amazing, he made him likable and interesting and I was always compelled by his scenes. The character reminded me a lot of Miles in "King Kong" (played by Jack Black), a character that also wanted fame and success more than anything and used questionable and even cruel methods to get it. He was terrifying in some scenes too, but always believable. Also, in the beginning of the movie i really felt the chemistry between August and Marlena, which made the character even more interesting; however, I did feel like Jacob and Marlena had chemistry too, and in my opinion this way it was more realistic (both men loved her and she also cared about both of them). \n\nI loved the movie, and I really recommend it to everyone. I would sincerely give it 10/10 stars. Of course there was some parts of the movie I didn't like (particularly towards the end of it), but overall it was a magical, spectacular and epic period movie, and I can't wait to see it again!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112523,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I may be a bit biased since I loved him in "Inglorious Basterds", but he was even more perfect in this movie. His portrayal of August was amazing, he made him likable and interesting and I was always compelled by his scenes. The character reminded me a lot of Miles in "King Kong" (played by Jack Black), a character that also wanted fame and success more than anything and used questionable and even cruel methods to get it. He was terrifying in some scenes too, but always believable. Also, in the beginning of the movie i really felt the chemistry between August and Marlena, which made the character even more interesting; however, I did feel like Jacob and Marlena had chemistry too, and in my opinion this way it was more realistic (both men loved her and she also cared about both of them). \n\nI loved the movie, and I really recommend it to everyone. I would sincerely give it 10/10 stars. Of course there was some parts of the movie I didn't like (particularly towards the end of it), but overall it was a magical, spectacular and epic period movie, and I can't wait to see it again!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112523,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long "suffering" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.\n\n I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":421122,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To my surprise, it did not disappoint.\n\nNow, several years later after having watched all three of these "Rings" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story.

To my surprise, it did not disappoint.\n\nNow, several years later after having watched all three of these "Rings" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts.

Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Directed by superstar in the making Ryan Coogler, and starring powerful performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone the film is amazing. Creed is exhilarating, beautifully acted, while honoring the previous Rocky films lovingly. The film may be a little too familiar at times, but at least approaches it's overused plot lines with a different take.\n\nFrom the opening scene the film captures your attention, showing us a glimpse into who this character is "a fighter." The film remains an exhilarating journey with this character, who is easy to connect with. As the film progresses, Coogler mixes old techniques like the famous Rocky slow motion sequences, with newer (less used) techniques like very intimate fight sequences, where the camera helps the viewer feel like they're standing in the ring. The film will draw you in from the moment it starts, to the moment it ends.\n\nOne reason the film is so exhilarating is the terrific acting of Michael B. Jordan, who leads this journey. Once again teaming up with director Ryan Coogler Jordan anchors the film, and in the process creates a relatable, and human main character. On this note, after seeing "Creed" and "Fruitvale Station" I would be willing to make the bold statement that I think Ryan Coogler is on his way to becoming the next Scorsese. All of this being said what may be even more satisfying is seeing Sylvester Stallone return to form as Rocky Balboa.\n\nSome may criticize the movie for not bringing a lot of original plot lines to the movie, they would be right. However, while not very original the film handles these plot lines from a different perspective. No longer are we watching the nobody rising up against the odds, now we see a man trying to get out of the larger than life shadows of a man he never knew. Those who love the Rocky films recognize the slow motion moments in almost every film, and the iconic way the boxing matches were choreographed. Creed departs from the overuse of slow motion and more adapts the fight choreography of Raging Bull, while still mixing the essence of the Rocky fight scenes. \n\nThe way Coogler mixes old with new in many different ways helps make the whole film feel like the story it's telling.

Directed by superstar in the making Ryan Coogler, and starring powerful performances from Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone the film is amazing. Creed is exhilarating, beautifully acted, while honoring the previous Rocky films lovingly. The film may be a little too familiar at times, but at least approaches it's overused plot lines with a different take.\n\nFrom the opening scene the film captures your attention, showing us a glimpse into who this character is "a fighter." The film remains an exhilarating journey with this character, who is easy to connect with. As the film progresses, Coogler mixes old techniques like the famous Rocky slow motion sequences, with newer (less used) techniques like very intimate fight sequences, where the camera helps the viewer feel like they're standing in the ring. The film will draw you in from the moment it starts, to the moment it ends.\n\nOne reason the film is so exhilarating is the terrific acting of Michael B. Jordan, who leads this journey. Once again teaming up with director Ryan Coogler Jordan anchors the film, and in the process creates a relatable, and human main character. On this note, after seeing "Creed" and "Fruitvale Station" I would be willing to make the bold statement that I think Ryan Coogler is on his way to becoming the next Scorsese. All of this being said what may be even more satisfying is seeing Sylvester Stallone return to form as Rocky Balboa.\n\nSome may criticize the movie for not bringing a lot of original plot lines to the movie, they would be right. However, while not very original the film handles these plot lines from a different perspective. No longer are we watching the nobody rising up against the odds, now we see a man trying to get out of the larger than life shadows of a man he never knew. Those who love the Rocky films recognize the slow motion moments in almost every film, and the iconic way the boxing matches were choreographed. Creed departs from the overuse of slow motion and more adapts the fight choreography of Raging Bull, while still mixing the essence of the Rocky fight scenes. \n\nThe way Coogler mixes old with new in many different ways helps make the whole film feel like the story it's telling. Coogler captures the tone of the older Rocky films, while also making a film distinctly different. Michael B. Jordan and Sylvester Stallone deliver, and Creed ends up being exactly what fans hoped it would be. In the end if you have the time go see Creed, it's a terrific 2 hours to spend.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"duration":"PT2H13M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Creed II contains a few of those-perhaps not as many as you'd like but a few. Adonis "Donny" Creed (Michael B. Jordan) and Bianca (Tessa Thompson) continue to share charming, effortless chemistry, leading to a few of those moving moments. Other moments come ringside when Donny and Rocky (Sylvester Stallone) exchange motivating words as the music swells, our pulses rise, and we slide to the edges of our seats. These moments are present in Creed II, but they don't pack the same punch as they have at their best, like in the first 'Creed' or 'Rocky.' There's something missing in the buildup and execution of these moments, and I suspect that that something is the delicate touch of director Ryan Coogler and the originality of first film in the series. Being the seventh film in this franchise, Creed II faced an uphill battle in the originality department. By now, we all know the beats and how the story arch is likely to play out. But this story felt like it should have been the first and most obvious one pitched in the writer's room and one that should not have been the final choice. It's tricky to describe what I mean without mentioning spoilers, so suffice it to say that we've seen this story before, and we all could have seen it coming this time. The story is made of 99% recycled material, which is something I like in plastic and paper products but not in movies. On top of the major issues with the plot, there are a few puzzling details, like why is Rocky so poor? He was the heavyweight champion of the world for nearly a decade, Philadelphia made a huge statue of him, and he is instantly recognized by adoring fans on a regular basis, yet for some reason, no one has any interest in his restaurant. Rocky, hire a manager! You could be raking in millions each year if you had someone helping you out. Another issue, and this one seems more pressing, is the confusing struggle that Donny has to find his motivation for the fight against Viktor Drago. Drago is the top contender in the world, and Donny is the heavyweight champion of the world. Drago is talking mountains of trash. Drago's dad killed Donny's dad in the ring. Those are all great reasons for Donny to want to fight him. I don't see the struggle. Fortunately, Michael B. Jordan is one of the most charismatic and energetic performers we currently have in Hollywood. His vivacity infuses the tired story with enough life to get by, and he absolutely pulls off all the training montages, even though he spends half his time doing neck curls, for some reason. In the end, we have the fight everyone wants. It's satisfying enough despite the mixed message that it sends about not giving up but also knowing when to throw in the towel because you're dangerously injured and could literally die in the ring. We live in a world where we know the dangers of concussions in sports and the devastating long-term damage that they have on the lives of athletes. I find it hard to ignore, which makes these brutal fights a little bit tougher to watch, and it makes the victory celebrations a little less sweet because the only way to really win is to retire healthy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110266,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There's a specular escape in Spain, an explosion in MI6 headquarters London and a chase on the River Thames to apprehend an assassin (Sicillian star, Maria Grazia Cucinotta) that climaxes at the Millennium Dome. All this action before the James Bond title song and it's carried out not just for show, but as it's all part of the story's later developments.\n\nMichael Apted directs the 19th Bond instalment in which Brosnan gives his finest performance as 007, he appears, confident, intellectual, more dangerous and authentic as the spy. In this he is injured and carries his ailment throughout the film, making him more vulnerable and real in life threaten situations, leaving the entertaining but bland Tomorrow Never Dies behind. \n\nFor the most part this instalment is more grounded and played serious with fewer gags than in previous Bonds, certainly less than Moore's outings. A lot of this is due to Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein screenplay which lends itself as a mystery, whodunit thriller theme and the villains, have more shades of grey as well as the heroes.\n\nDespite, Denise Richards beauty with brains role as Dr. Christmas Jones, she still appears as the typical Bond girl by the end. Robert Carlyle character Renard is given depth and ulterior motives as the villain but he still is cliché Bond Villain with scars. This aside, Sophie Marceau is excellent as femme fatale oil baron heiress Elektra King and M's (Judie Dench) late friends daughter. Dench is given more to do and shines on screen, and regulars Desmond Llewelyn (Q), Samantha Bond (Miss Moneypenny) and Colin Salmon reprise their roles. Robbie Coltrane makes a welcomed return as Zukovsky to briefly assist Bond, and Goldie makes an appearance as a henchman. Comedy legend John Cleese plays Q's side kick R. \n\nThe music score and Barry's trademark theme comes in just at the right moments to heighten the action on screen. And as a bonus the title songs music is interlaced throughout the movie.\n\nThe World Is Not Enough is only marred by some poor cringe-worthy quips that are synonyms with the franchise. It's a shame that all the hard work of writers, Bronson's and Apted's subtly was discarded in Die Another Day (2002), where it was CGI heavy and returned to a Moore- like, lighter spectacle adventure.\n\nThis Bond is in the tradition of the earlier Connery outings, the vein of Dalton's steely incarnation, and a credit must goto Pierce Brosnan as this influenced the style of the later Casino Royale rework.\n\nUltimately, The World Is Not Enough due to it's great plot is one of the better Bonds that can be enjoyed by fans and the causal viewer."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":190922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Its limited release may restrict its appeal, but I'd suggest anyone who wants to laugh on Christmas, should check this one out. \n\n'The Interview' Synopsis: Dave Skylark and producer Aaron Rapoport run the celebrity tabloid show "Skylark Tonight." When they land an interview with a surprise fan, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, they are recruited by the CIA to turn their trip to Pyongyang into an assassination mission.\n\n'The Interview' has its share of hiccups. Firstly, the concept itself, would raise eye-brows &amp; the sequences involving the dictator, are quite shocking, even though its told in all good humor. One more thing, the excessive violence in the narrative puts off you. The bloodshed could've easily been calmer.\n\nBut on the plus side, 'The Interview' is quite a joyride! Seth Rogen's Story, is nicely complimented by a mostly laugh-out-loud Screenplay Written by Dan Sterling. There are moments of pure hilarity, as well as moments involving shocking dialogue. Rogen &amp; Evan Goldberg's Direction is perfect. Cinematography is awesome. Editing is rightly done. Art Design is excellent. \n\nPerformance-Wise: Rogen is in very good form, delivering above expectations. James Franco is a complete riot. His over-the-top, loud performance as the self-obsessed TV-Anchor, brings the house down on numerous occasions. Lizzy Caplan is first-rate. Randall Park is another topper as the megalomaniac dictator. His scenes with Franco, are truly funny. Diana Bang is stupendous, she unknowingly steals the show!\n\nOn the whole, 'The Interview' has moments of shock &amp; gore, but there is also a lot of humor in here, that does the trick.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":311443,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Its limited release may restrict its appeal, but I'd suggest anyone who wants to laugh on Christmas, should check this one out. \n\n'The Interview' Synopsis: Dave Skylark and producer Aaron Rapoport run the celebrity tabloid show "Skylark Tonight." When they land an interview with a surprise fan, North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un, they are recruited by the CIA to turn their trip to Pyongyang into an assassination mission.\n\n'The Interview' has its share of hiccups. Firstly, the concept itself, would raise eye-brows &amp; the sequences involving the dictator, are quite shocking, even though its told in all good humor. One more thing, the excessive violence in the narrative puts off you. The bloodshed could've easily been calmer.\n\nBut on the plus side, 'The Interview' is quite a joyride! Seth Rogen's Story, is nicely complimented by a mostly laugh-out-loud Screenplay Written by Dan Sterling. There are moments of pure hilarity, as well as moments involving shocking dialogue. Rogen &amp; Evan Goldberg's Direction is perfect. Cinematography is awesome. Editing is rightly done. Art Design is excellent. \n\nPerformance-Wise: Rogen is in very good form, delivering above expectations. James Franco is a complete riot. His over-the-top, loud performance as the self-obsessed TV-Anchor, brings the house down on numerous occasions. Lizzy Caplan is first-rate. Randall Park is another topper as the megalomaniac dictator. His scenes with Franco, are truly funny. Diana Bang is stupendous, she unknowingly steals the show!\n\nOn the whole, 'The Interview' has moments of shock &amp; gore, but there is also a lot of humor in here, that does the trick.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":311443,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They've introduced so many characters early on that you're almost perplexed at times as to who's who and their relation to the other characters as well as their relevance to whatever the plot is becoming. As for the plot, it tries to be too mysterious and foreboding that it only confuses itself in numerous plot holes and bad character decisions for the sake of extending the story and providing unnecessary drama.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23011,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Usually, sequels are made to continue the story on the big screen. Creating this excellent series was a much better decision than producing lousy sequels for the masses. \n\nFans of the movie get to further explore all the ideas: The Stargate system, used by humans to travel the galaxy for thousands of years; Egyptian, Norse, and alien mythology; true science fiction - with fictional devices and concepts based on current science; and human exploration of our known universe  part of what made Star Trek so popular. \n\nYou see the characters develop over time, the quirky unexpected humor, the use of an alien who doesn't fully understand American English (like Data), the struggle of the oppressed, the lengths humans go in order to survive, politics and government bureaucracy, and the underlying tenet that there is more to human life then our brief appearance on planet Earth.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":85393,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After the body of a local student is found in a forest, the police discover that she was murdered. A new teacher Pawel Zawadzki arrives at her school, but his reason for leaving his city job is unclear. From there develops a wonderful plot that encompasses local corruption, drug dealing and the overlapping worlds of students and adults, linked up by the desire of Pawel to discover the truth behind the girl's death. It is hard to describe in too much detail why this wonderfully shot and atmospheric thriller is so gripping, without giving too much away. Yet I hope I can persuade you to give this a go. I rarely waqtch TV, as so much of it is tripe, let alone be drawn into something so compelling that I would have happily binge watched this series. If you have enjoyed the Bridge (Bron/Broen)or the Lawyer (Advokaten), you will gripped by this intriguing, well written and superbly cast thriller","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1465,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After the body of a local student is found in a forest, the police discover that she was murdered. A new teacher Pawel Zawadzki arrives at her school, but his reason for leaving his city job is unclear. From there develops a wonderful plot that encompasses local corruption, drug dealing and the overlapping worlds of students and adults, linked up by the desire of Pawel to discover the truth behind the girl's death. It is hard to describe in too much detail why this wonderfully shot and atmospheric thriller is so gripping, without giving too much away. Yet I hope I can persuade you to give this a go. I rarely waqtch TV, as so much of it is tripe, let alone be drawn into something so compelling that I would have happily binge watched this series. If you have enjoyed the Bridge (Bron/Broen)or the Lawyer (Advokaten), you will gripped by this intriguing, well written and superbly cast thriller","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1465,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After the body of a local student is found in a forest, the police discover that she was murdered. A new teacher Pawel Zawadzki arrives at her school, but his reason for leaving his city job is unclear. From there develops a wonderful plot that encompasses local corruption, drug dealing and the overlapping worlds of students and adults, linked up by the desire of Pawel to discover the truth behind the girl's death. It is hard to describe in too much detail why this wonderfully shot and atmospheric thriller is so gripping, without giving too much away. Yet I hope I can persuade you to give this a go. I rarely waqtch TV, as so much of it is tripe, let alone be drawn into something so compelling that I would have happily binge watched this series.

Because of his well known creative process, the intrigue would be to see the actors and the characters and dramas (and comedies) they created. They were always worth watching in a voyeuristic way due to Leigh's unobtrusive camera work. \n\nVera Drake is well worth seeing for these same reasons, but Leigh has made a bigger and better movie than ever before, even with all of Topsy Turvy's bombast. His ambitions as director are greater than ever. First of all, to take on the subject of abortion is very brave. But I'll leave that for others to discuss. What was of interest to me from the opening shot was that this was going to be a visual tour de force, and it was.\n\nPainting the scenes in dark, crushing browns and greens, with tight camera angles or letting the light in, each scene had the feel of a well thought out canvas, even the cut aways between scenes were new, inventive and beautiful.\n\nAnd the acting is great and the scenes of the family interacting in close quarters, moving in synch are so pitch perfect you feel they have been doing this for decades.\n\nSo if you're thinking of seeing this movie, sit back, relax, and prepare to be taken on a slow, masterful ride."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24380,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Because of his well known creative process, the intrigue would be to see the actors and the characters and dramas (and comedies) they created. They were always worth watching in a voyeuristic way due to Leigh's unobtrusive camera work. \n\nVera Drake is well worth seeing for these same reasons, but Leigh has made a bigger and better movie than ever before, even with all of Topsy Turvy's bombast. His ambitions as director are greater than ever. First of all, to take on the subject of abortion is very brave. But I'll leave that for others to discuss. What was of interest to me from the opening shot was that this was going to be a visual tour de force, and it was.\n\nPainting the scenes in dark, crushing browns and greens, with tight camera angles or letting the light in, each scene had the feel of a well thought out canvas, even the cut aways between scenes were new, inventive and beautiful.\n\nAnd the acting is great and the scenes of the family interacting in close quarters, moving in synch are so pitch perfect you feel they have been doing this for decades.\n\nSo if you're thinking of seeing this movie, sit back, relax, and prepare to be taken on a slow, masterful ride.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24380,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is also a very fine study of British theater – not the glowing lights 'Broadway' type, but the little touring countries that brought and bring Shakespeare to the people in the little towns where the audiences respect theater.\n\nThe film opens during the blitz of England during WW II in a rundown old theater that despite the blitz an audience has packed the house for a production by a small, struggling theater company of Shakespeare's 'King Lear'. The titular head of the company (Sarah Lancashire) worries that aging actor 'Sir' (Anthony Hopkins) and his wife Her Ladyship (Emily Watson) will be able to perform. 'Sir' is plainly unwell, discharging himself from hospital and Her Ladyship believes he should cancel his upcoming performance of 'King Lear'. However Norman (Ian McKellen), his outspoken, gay dresser disagrees and is determined that the show will go on, cajoling the confused 'Sir' into giving a performance - one which will be his swansong, at the same time drawing a parallel between King Lear and his fool as Norman, despite ultimate disappointment, serves his master.\n\nThe relationship between Sir and Norman is profound and in the end very touching. Hopkins and McKellen and Watson are in top form and are ably supported by Lancashire, Edward Fox (unrecognizable in his costume as the Fool), and Vanessa Kirby. This is a splendid film on every count and one that deserves many awards."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2915,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is also a very fine study of British theater – not the glowing lights 'Broadway' type, but the little touring countries that brought and bring Shakespeare to the people in the little towns where the audiences respect theater.\n\nThe film opens during the blitz of England during WW II in a rundown old theater that despite the blitz an audience has packed the house for a production by a small, struggling theater company of Shakespeare's 'King Lear'. The titular head of the company (Sarah Lancashire) worries that aging actor 'Sir' (Anthony Hopkins) and his wife Her Ladyship (Emily Watson) will be able to perform. 'Sir' is plainly unwell, discharging himself from hospital and Her Ladyship believes he should cancel his upcoming performance of 'King Lear'. However Norman (Ian McKellen), his outspoken, gay dresser disagrees and is determined that the show will go on, cajoling the confused 'Sir' into giving a performance - one which will be his swansong, at the same time drawing a parallel between King Lear and his fool as Norman, despite ultimate disappointment, serves his master.\n\nThe relationship between Sir and Norman is profound and in the end very touching. Hopkins and McKellen and Watson are in top form and are ably supported by Lancashire, Edward Fox (unrecognizable in his costume as the Fool), and Vanessa Kirby. This is a splendid film on every count and one that deserves many awards.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2915,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'll be the first person to acknowledge this. Of the roughly 2600 titles I've rated on here, only 34 have a 10. Parasite is one of them. If this isn't a masterpiece, then I don't know what is.\n\nI'm going to keep it vague on the plot-front, because I didn't know anything about it going in, and was really excited to see it progress and unfold in satisfying, unexpected ways.\n\nWhat I will say is that this film, more than just about any other I've seen, put me through so many different emotional states during its 132-minute runtime, and did so without ever feeling muddled or tonally inconsistent. Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).\n\nAnd it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast.

Parts of this movie were hilarious. Parts were heartbreaking. Other parts were insanely suspenseful (I'm honestly not sure if I've felt this close to the edge of my seat since the final season of Breaking Bad, way back in 2013).\n\nAnd it does all this while being perfectly paced, beautifully directed, and amazingly acted from every single member of its cast.

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.\n\nAnd one final note. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When I heard about the project, I wondered if AMC would be able to handle the balls to wall, r-rated nature of the comic, and it appears they can.\n\nPreacher takes place in Annville, Texas and follows Jesse Custer, the quintessential "man with a past". Presumably on the road for years, Jesse has returned to Annville to follow in his fathers footsteps as the small town Preacher. \n\nThe showed is steeped in brooding, Americana darkness, but also contains a funny side, just like the source material.\n\nThe pilot episode blew me away. \n\nQuite simply, this appears to be one of the best new shows on television and will hopefully have a long life on AMC.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69490,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I should rephrase that; it wasn't so much the dialog, but his mannerisms and facial expressions that said it all!\n\nThe movie wasn't just about revenge, it also looked into how he got to be the way he was... the way he was treated growing up. It talked about forgiveness &amp; redemption. \n\nI say it's about time The Rock (I will always know him as that!) got back to what he does best, Action/Adventure. Like The Rundown he did with Sean Scott. \n\nAll in All, I would give this movie a B++","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":102453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While for the rest we have a standard french police series with the usual amount of crimes and personal life of the police unit members, what makes it unique it's her: goofy, bold, reasoning, she gets the job done her way. I don't think you can remain indifferent to the character: either you like her or not (personally I adore). She earned a place in the long list of eccentric people started, I believe, by Dr. House. The role is played by Odile Vuillemin. Update: season 7 sees the departure of Chloé, substituted by a new profiler, Adèle Delettre, a recurring character in the show. Her approach is very different from Saint-Laurent's and the series takes a more dramatic tone. A bit of sense of humour is missing so I'd give 7/10 to this new "profilage".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1128,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While for the rest we have a standard french police series with the usual amount of crimes and personal life of the police unit members, what makes it unique it's her: goofy, bold, reasoning, she gets the job done her way. I don't think you can remain indifferent to the character: either you like her or not (personally I adore). She earned a place in the long list of eccentric people started, I believe, by Dr. House. The role is played by Odile Vuillemin. Update: season 7 sees the departure of Chloé, substituted by a new profiler, Adèle Delettre, a recurring character in the show. Her approach is very different from Saint-Laurent's and the series takes a more dramatic tone. A bit of sense of humour is missing so I'd give 7/10 to this new "profilage".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1128,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
