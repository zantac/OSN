That is something that does not come naturally in the world of film. Movies glamorize almost everything they face matters with; whether it's violence, drugs, sex, or other behaviors. Movies persuade, advertise, and sell incorrect messages to hungry and excepting pedestrians. Not only is "Bringing Out The Dead" an anti-violence, drugs and glamour film, it also manages to deliver its message through one of the most talented actors in Hollywood clearly and understandably. This is one of the year's most unsettling and uncompromising productions, and also one of the year's best.\n\n"Bringing Out the Dead" offers no story in its existence. But there is no actual need for a plot here, due to a strong, precise narrative through-line and focused point of view seen through its central character. He is Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage), who narrates the film with a sense of depravity. He and his buddies, Marcus (Ving Rhames), Tom (Tom Sizemore), and Larry (John Goodman), work the evening shift at New York's Hell's Kitchen as Ambulance Drivers for an emergency hospital. They live a life full of stress, sweat, and desperation. Frank often comes to work pleading for his boss to fire him. The opening scene, which properly induces the desperate and gritty lives of the main characters, features Frank and Larry, being called to the home of Mary Burke, whose unhealthy father is having a heart attack. They stabilize him, rush the man to their emergency care facility, and go on with their lives.\n\nNow, where many "lesser" movies would have developed a romantic subplot with the Mary character and Frank, "Bringing Out the Dead" is too focused and skillful to do that. There is affection between the two. But Frank is in such a position in his life that he just isn't prone to fall for a woman. Nor does he give in to any of the many hookers standing on the street blocks tempting him to keep them in business. He is on the verge of an nervous break down, and the film never pretends otherwise.\n\nWhile for the most part, this movie didn't give into any major distractions or side-subjects, it did have several flawed and unexplained subplots. The story featuring Frank constantly being haunted by the ghost of a young girl he lost some time ago isn't really explained enough. Nor does an unusually bizarre scene later on payoff featuring Frank saving lost souls in pain beneath the streets of New York. And there seems to be an extremely dangerous drug featured in the movie, which strangely appears at the overdoes scenes where Frank is called to--this isn't detailed enough to pay off either. I do realize the purpose of us not knowing about this medical issue; we don't have the knowledge because Frank doesn't. But I still think there may have been a way to inform the audience on the context of this material, without making the hero look stupid. Also, the film is over narrated by Frank, who sometimes describes his interesting past experiences through words, not flashbacks or visions, which would have been much more intriguing.\n\nScorsese makes no sense of the chaotic, unorganized, unsettling medical experiences patients go through in the emergency room where Frank doctors in. The style he uses to depict the film in is flawless in this justification: the camera angles are mind-warping and fast paced, the atmosphere of the movie is gritty, with blood and vulgarism abound. The characters pace frantically as they travel across one end of the building to the next, not sure to where or whom they are going. The characters also are injected with a deep sense of lifeless scrounge, as they stare and gaze into each other's eyes, only to discover there is nothing in each other. In some aspects, this film is like "Saving Private Ryan": a tantalizing hell.\n\nAnd Nicolas Cage delivers yet another fascinating performance here. His character is empathized with the entire way through, even if narration is used instead of illusion. He manages to depict his character through the torment and emotional damnation required. He pursues profoundness in scenes where his character realizes happiness in itself. "I fell like I saved someone," mutters Frank to himself. Good job, Frank. You saved yourself.\n\nBrought to you by Paramount Pictures and Touchstone Pictures.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65012,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For once, justice is done to the nuanced flora, fauna, terrain, and architecture of this region so plagued with one-dimensional portrayals. And it shows the beauty of the people. Yet this only serves to intesify the first-person experience of what violence ravashes so beautiful a place. By grounding a story of Hell in lush Eden, the filmmakers humanize a narrative that would otherwise be overlooked by reductive stereotypes.\n\nSymbolic imagery is worked into the narrative with truly uncommon delicacy: scenic shots of upside down landscapes and a profaned church are together a meditation on the desecration of the land. Intentional closeups on faces are icons. The one unholy icon was appropriately vile - meaningful in light of the smoldering spirituality of this film.\n\nMost impressive of all, however, is the bravery of the filmmakers to create such an honest portrayal of the cartels. It is thoroughly damning in every sense of the word. One is left to wonder how they navigated the filming process - the real border, government and cartel checkpoints, all in an area that is, at present, actually controlled by the cartel. Are those involved with the film currently safe? It undoubtedly took immense courage to take on such a risk, when mum's the word, as the film so unflinchingly shows.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":700,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For once, justice is done to the nuanced flora, fauna, terrain, and architecture of this region so plagued with one-dimensional portrayals. And it shows the beauty of the people. Yet this only serves to intesify the first-person experience of what violence ravashes so beautiful a place. By grounding a story of Hell in lush Eden, the filmmakers humanize a narrative that would otherwise be overlooked by reductive stereotypes.\n\nSymbolic imagery is worked into the narrative with truly uncommon delicacy: scenic shots of upside down landscapes and a profaned church are together a meditation on the desecration of the land. Intentional closeups on faces are icons. The one unholy icon was appropriately vile - meaningful in light of the smoldering spirituality of this film.\n\nMost impressive of all, however, is the bravery of the filmmakers to create such an honest portrayal of the cartels. It is thoroughly damning in every sense of the word. One is left to wonder how they navigated the filming process - the real border, government and cartel checkpoints, all in an area that is, at present, actually controlled by the cartel. Are those involved with the film currently safe? It undoubtedly took immense courage to take on such a risk, when mum's the word, as the film so unflinchingly shows.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":700,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

What captured my attention from the outset were the spectacular set design and the period costumes that accurately depict life from that time. The production team, particularly director Karim Aïnouz and producer Rodrigo Teixeira, have my ultimate respect in nailing those aspects so accurately. This film entertained and educated me about that period of time and its culture, which are very unique characteristics I don't often see, but love.\n\nThe film is about two inseparable sisters living in Rio de Janeiro during the 1950s, that live under their conservative parents' strict guidance. Even though both sisters are involved in the traditional life that surrounds them, Euridice wants to become a renowned pianist and Guida wants to find true love. When their father separates them and makes them live apart from each other, they work to meet their goals, while hoping that they can reunite one day and celebrate life together, since they are each other's support and joy.\n\nMy favorite scene is when Euridice carefully covers for Guida's secret nighttime outings to dance clubs with a Greek sailor. She encourages her sister to not give in to their parents' strict lifestyle and proposes that they should expose themselves to experiences that will fill them with happiness.\n\nThe important message that I learned from this film is the importance of how women have fought for their place and equality within a patriarchal society. Before, women were submissive to the patriarch, but as time has passed, society has realized what a huge injustice was being made and corrected the social forms. This movie is very big on showing how times were different back then for women and how thankful we all must be that a turn was made. Young women like Euridice and Guida struggled from an early age to find happiness. I rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults.\n\nReviewed by Alejandra G. , KIDS FIRST! Reviewers.

He, at the start of the movie, ends up becoming a big brother. The new addition to the household of course creates some new tensions, and the way Kun ends up dealing with the divided attention of his parents is by travelling through time to meet his family members in different points in time. Like you do.\n\nMamoru Hosoda, the director, is a real up-and-coming name in the anime industry, with some true gems under his name. Wolf Children and Summer Wars to name a few. His second to last film, The Boy and the Beast, did not impress me all that much, but fortunately Mirai is a slight uptick from that. And I've always liked his animation style, and I still do. The almost too simplistic character designs set against elaborate backgrounds are a joy to watch and there's a really great sense of movement in everything he does.\n\nI like the idea of Mirai, on paper. A young boy, settled with new responsibilities, turns to make-belief and fantasy in order to grow as a human being and as a big brother. Unfortunately the focus of the film is on his temper tantrums and his difficulties in accepting that he is not the sole focus of his parents' love. The problem with that being that almost the entirety of the film is him acting like a total brat. And it's hard to get behind a character like that. This film sorely needs a bit more sugar to make the medicine go down, if you know what I mean.\n\nI would also have liked for the movie to confirm that he is in fact imagining all these things. Now it's a weird "is it or is it not" that pleases no one.\n\nThen again, some of the individual segments are really great. I especially liked the bit about his great-grandfather with its post-war aesthetics and its focus on looking ahead and not giving up no matter what the circumstances.\n\nIs it the best movie Mamoru Hosoda has ever done? No, not by a long shot, but it's still a very well animated movie with some truly inspired pieces. The main character is a bit hard to swallow, but then again he's a four-year-old boy. None of them are angels to begin with.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When actual survival is at stake, this story showed well that some of us truly can find the right stuff to survive when no better choices are possible.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137465,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's true it is very quiet and low-key, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing. It has a distinct realistic feel to it, and it manages to be extremely suspenseful without using over-the-top action or an overblown soundtrack. There were several moments that actually had me on the edge of my seat.\n\nFans of Eastwood and McGoohan, who both give fantastic performances, should love this. Fans of prison movies should love this. Fans of suspense movies in general should love this. It is a top-notch movie with good performances all around, and I'd highly recommend it.\n\n10/10 stars. Pure, solid entertainment.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124332,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The masterful use of sound reinforces this greatly and forms a deeply meditative experience akin to ASMR, yet it remains accessible to more or less everyone. There's a profound respect for both the protagonist and the land seen throughout the film, and I find it remarkable how they manage to capture such beauty in almost every single shot. The storytelling is minimalistic and intuitive; the protagonist does not utter a single word throughout the entire movie, and it works incredibly well! The character Lillian is a masterclass in determination, subliminality and self-sufficiency. The other characters sparsely found throughout the film almost seems like extensions of nature itself; indifferent, providing and sometimes harmful but not particularly caring. The music is as grand as nature and as vulnerable as Lillian. There's a melancholy in there that reminds me a fair bit of Arvo Pärt.\n\nAt first the ending seemed slightly fragmented from the rest of the movie, and this appears like the only potential weakspot of the entire movie. No matter how you experience it, the rest of the film stands firmly on it's feet and proves that life is truly about the journey and not the destination.\n\nI watched this with a friend that has a widely different taste in film compared to me. We both sat speechless throughout the entire movie wishing for it to never end. This is an absolute must-see at the theater!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":717,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The masterful use of sound reinforces this greatly and forms a deeply meditative experience akin to ASMR, yet it remains accessible to more or less everyone. There's a profound respect for both the protagonist and the land seen throughout the film, and I find it remarkable how they manage to capture such beauty in almost every single shot. The storytelling is minimalistic and intuitive; the protagonist does not utter a single word throughout the entire movie, and it works incredibly well! The character Lillian is a masterclass in determination, subliminality and self-sufficiency. The other characters sparsely found throughout the film almost seems like extensions of nature itself; indifferent, providing and sometimes harmful but not particularly caring. The music is as grand as nature and as vulnerable as Lillian. There's a melancholy in there that reminds me a fair bit of Arvo Pärt.\n\nAt first the ending seemed slightly fragmented from the rest of the movie, and this appears like the only potential weakspot of the entire movie. No matter how you experience it, the rest of the film stands firmly on it's feet and proves that life is truly about the journey and not the destination.\n\nI watched this with a friend that has a widely different taste in film compared to me. We both sat speechless throughout the entire movie wishing for it to never end. This is an absolute must-see at the theater!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":717,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When it first started, I watched it for the fire and rescue related calls, the action. I find now, it is far less about calls or incidents to which a fire department would respond, and far more about personal relationships and political nonsense. I can get that junk on other shows. Last night I watched what I consider the best episode of Chicago Med produced to date, because it focused on the events of a hospital emergency department the entire episode, not personal relationships.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A year later, I obtained the DVD of the first season and thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact, I thought it might be the best of all three CSI shows but I'll wait on that call until a complete second season is done.\n\nI liked this debut season more than the others for two main reasons:\n\n1 - It did not have all the little soap opera side-stories involving the characters that the two other CSI shows have. Each show was strictly about the crime(s).\n\n2 - All the lead characters are fun to watch and had no annoying personality traits. True, the head guy, played by Gary Sinise, didn't have much of a personality but I liked his low-key, no-nonsense approach. Bill Petersen interjects too much New Age philosophy on his show and David Caruso is so ultra-dramatic that he's almost cartoonish at times. Sinise just does the job with that's it. Same for the rest of the crew. I understand one them, Vanessa Ferlito, left the show after this season, and I'm sorry to hear that. I enjoyed her face and her humor. I can only hope the rest of the cast stays. A good share of the cast seems to be made up of New "Yawkers" with that accent and that just adds to the believability of the show. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed "Stan," played by Carmine Giovinzzo, the best, the most interesting was Melina Kanakaredes. From shot to shot, she's different in appearance from strange and unappealing to gorgeous, depending on the camera angle and lighting. She's hard to figure, both in looks and her character. \n\nI never get tired of those aerial shots of the city, either. Odd they were tinted the blue the first month of the season and then brown-and-gray the rest of the year. As with the other CSI shows, the camera-work is fantastic. Those who have never seen any of the CSI shows on DVD owe themselves a look. They are spectacularly filmed.\n\nHowever, unlike Miami and Las Vegas CSI shows, this is basically a no-glitz affair with the stories dominating. One problem with these shows is they are filmed on Los Angeles movie sets, so most of the time, because of crowds and other problems in filming locally, you don't see the main characters actually in the locales they are supposed to be. It would be fun watching them chase criminals in Central Park, at the Empire State Building, through Madison Square Garden, etc."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44216,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

True, the head guy, played by Gary Sinise, didn't have much of a personality but I liked his low-key, no-nonsense approach.

I can only hope the rest of the cast stays. A good share of the cast seems to be made up of New "Yawkers" with that accent and that just adds to the believability of the show. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed "Stan," played by Carmine Giovinzzo, the best, the most interesting was Melina Kanakaredes. From shot to shot, she's different in appearance from strange and unappealing to gorgeous, depending on the camera angle and lighting. She's hard to figure, both in looks and her character. \n\nI never get tired of those aerial shots of the city, either. Odd they were tinted the blue the first month of the season and then brown-and-gray the rest of the year. As with the other CSI shows, the camera-work is fantastic. Those who have never seen any of the CSI shows on DVD owe themselves a look. They are spectacularly filmed.\n\nHowever, unlike Miami and Las Vegas CSI shows, this is basically a no-glitz affair with the stories dominating. One problem with these shows is they are filmed on Los Angeles movie sets, so most of the time, because of crowds and other problems in filming locally, you don't see the main characters actually in the locales they are supposed to be.

Case in point, "Smokey &amp; The Bandit". Now I am dating myself if that's the only film I can come up with when it comes to trilogies. But car movies are seldomly done in trilogies. Star Wars, The Godfather, Lord of the Rings and Back to the Future are the only exceptions that have worked in the past because there's an on-going story line.\n\nTokyo Drift was a good film. Good plot line (if you disagree, then you're a "Too much to think" film-goer, stay with chick-flicks then). Good action. And of course, cool cars. The fact that it strayed away from Part I &amp; II was a good idea. And film director, Justin Lin did an great job getting his vision to film. The mounted camera on a super-fast go-cart gave some spectacular shots.\n\nIt's a good escape film with the "new kid in town, gets beat up or loses in some sort of competition, learns from a local to be better then wins in the end." But for a trilogy film it's excellent compared to other Part III films that have been released.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":248069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Case in point, "Smokey &amp; The Bandit". Now I am dating myself if that's the only film I can come up with when it comes to trilogies. But car movies are seldomly done in trilogies. Star Wars, The Godfather, Lord of the Rings and Back to the Future are the only exceptions that have worked in the past because there's an on-going story line.\n\nTokyo Drift was a good film. Good plot line (if you disagree, then you're a "Too much to think" film-goer, stay with chick-flicks then). Good action. And of course, cool cars. The fact that it strayed away from Part I &amp; II was a good idea. And film director, Justin Lin did an great job getting his vision to film. The mounted camera on a super-fast go-cart gave some spectacular shots.\n\nIt's a good escape film with the "new kid in town, gets beat up or loses in some sort of competition, learns from a local to be better then wins in the end." But for a trilogy film it's excellent compared to other Part III films that have been released.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":248069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A year later, I obtained the DVD of the first season and thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact, I thought it might be the best of all three CSI shows but I'll wait on that call until a complete second season is done.\n\nI liked this debut season more than the others for two main reasons:\n\n1 - It did not have all the little soap opera side-stories involving the characters that the two other CSI shows have. Each show was strictly about the crime(s).\n\n2 - All the lead characters are fun to watch and had no annoying personality traits. True, the head guy, played by Gary Sinise, didn't have much of a personality but I liked his low-key, no-nonsense approach. Bill Petersen interjects too much New Age philosophy on his show and David Caruso is so ultra-dramatic that he's almost cartoonish at times. Sinise just does the job with that's it. Same for the rest of the crew. I understand one them, Vanessa Ferlito, left the show after this season, and I'm sorry to hear that. I enjoyed her face and her humor. I can only hope the rest of the cast stays. A good share of the cast seems to be made up of New "Yawkers" with that accent and that just adds to the believability of the show. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed "Stan," played by Carmine Giovinzzo, the best, the most interesting was Melina Kanakaredes. From shot to shot, she's different in appearance from strange and unappealing to gorgeous, depending on the camera angle and lighting. She's hard to figure, both in looks and her character. \n\nI never get tired of those aerial shots of the city, either. Odd they were tinted the blue the first month of the season and then brown-and-gray the rest of the year. As with the other CSI shows, the camera-work is fantastic. Those who have never seen any of the CSI shows on DVD owe themselves a look. They are spectacularly filmed.\n\nHowever, unlike Miami and Las Vegas CSI shows, this is basically a no-glitz affair with the stories dominating. One problem with these shows is they are filmed on Los Angeles movie sets, so most of the time, because of crowds and other problems in filming locally, you don't see the main characters actually in the locales they are supposed to be. It would be fun watching them chase criminals in Central Park, at the Empire State Building, through Madison Square Garden, etc."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44216,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When it first started, I watched it for the fire and rescue related calls, the action. I find now, it is far less about calls or incidents to which a fire department would respond, and far more about personal relationships and political nonsense. I can get that junk on other shows. Last night I watched what I consider the best episode of Chicago Med produced to date, because it focused on the events of a hospital emergency department the entire episode, not personal relationships.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Based on the real-life work of forensic anthropologist and novelist Kathy Reichs, it's fun, kicky, and only occasionally too gruesome to look at. Not quite like one of Ms. Reichs' novels, it is still a pleasure for a fan (me!) to watch. Boreanaz' past work on Buffy and Angel stands in good stead here as he delivers lines that stand up to a strong female role without diminishing it. Also like Buffy, humor lends grace to embarrassing social situations that highlight common human vulnerabilities. Surrounding the 2 major players are other characters who add to the thrust of a character driven show. The writers do good work giving each character unique attributes that have nothing to do with hair color or body measurements. The entire cast does a good job presenting real, quirky individuals who don't have to rely on looks to sell the worth of their character to the viewers. That alone is something new for any CSI show. Still some rough edges in writing and delivery (Tempe's "I wish this was the worst I have seen" was painful for all the wrong reasons),"Bones" has great potential.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142383,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. \n\nSandra Oh stands out for her comic timing, but the entire cast is superb. It's not as grave as ER, but is just as compelling. Also, it's a little more accessible than ER and some of the more serious medical dramas. The show is definitely worth catching--if you can't watch it when it airs, TiVo it or rent the first season DVD. It's well worth the time spent! It's great for marathon viewings!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":260027,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It didn't have the excitement and color of the Las Vegas and Miami shows.\n\nWell, I turned out to be premature in my judgment of this show. A year later, I obtained the DVD of the first season and thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact, I thought it might be the best of all three CSI shows but I'll wait on that call until a complete second season is done.\n\nI liked this debut season more than the others for two main reasons:\n\n1 - It did not have all the little soap opera side-stories involving the characters that the two other CSI shows have. Each show was strictly about the crime(s).\n\n2 - All the lead characters are fun to watch and had no annoying personality traits. True, the head guy, played by Gary Sinise, didn't have much of a personality but I liked his low-key, no-nonsense approach. Bill Petersen interjects too much New Age philosophy on his show and David Caruso is so ultra-dramatic that he's almost cartoonish at times. Sinise just does the job with that's it. Same for the rest of the crew. I understand one them, Vanessa Ferlito, left the show after this season, and I'm sorry to hear that. I enjoyed her face and her humor. I can only hope the rest of the cast stays. A good share of the cast seems to be made up of New "Yawkers" with that accent and that just adds to the believability of the show. \n\nAlthough I enjoyed "Stan," played by Carmine Giovinzzo, the best, the most interesting was Melina Kanakaredes. From shot to shot, she's different in appearance from strange and unappealing to gorgeous, depending on the camera angle and lighting. She's hard to figure, both in looks and her character. \n\nI never get tired of those aerial shots of the city, either. Odd they were tinted the blue the first month of the season and then brown-and-gray the rest of the year. As with the other CSI shows, the camera-work is fantastic. Those who have never seen any of the CSI shows on DVD owe themselves a look. They are spectacularly filmed.\n\nHowever, unlike Miami and Las Vegas CSI shows, this is basically a no-glitz affair with the stories dominating. One problem with these shows is they are filmed on Los Angeles movie sets, so most of the time, because of crowds and other problems in filming locally, you don't see the main characters actually in the locales they are supposed to be. It would be fun watching them chase criminals in Central Park, at the Empire State Building, through Madison Square Garden, etc.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44216,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

(Max has however become a blend of Wall Street's Gordon Gecco and Capt. Aubrey  a cold power hungry cut-throat exterior with a bit of a romantic hedonist hiding a Depardieu-like charming buffoon locked inside.) Sir Ridley Scott makes it clear that the real star here is the Provencal countryside in all of its golden sun soaked glory. Russell is the fulcrum that moves us from one beautiful scene to the next, lightly shuffling and dancing in over-sized pajamas with a suit jacket and a tie for a belt.\n\nAnd oddly, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nAs obvious as the story line is (both in the book and the film) it remains absolutely charming and Crowe's performance is an essential part of what makes it work, hammy or no. He looks great and his trust in Scott as a director allows him to simply have fun here  a nice break from all of the heavy (and often heavy handed) Oscar bait bio-pics he's pigeonholed himself into recently.\n\nThe rest of the cast is picture perfect. I've been waiting to see when Freddie Highmore would play a young Russell and he's lovely here, big eyed and gracefully gawky as young Max. He holds his own against Albert Finney's lovingly blustery Uncle Henry. Marion Cotillard is gorgeous as Fanny and also sturdy enough to hold her own against both Max and Crowe himself. Abbie Cornish is pretty and sweet and her American accent is damn near perfect. Isabelle Candelier is a colorful counterpoint to Max's stuffy British ways, but it is Didier Bourdon who nearly walks away with the picture. His is a character we haven't seen done a million times before and whose eyes hint at a story equal in richness to the Château itself. Archie Panjabi is Max's assistant, a character created for the film. As the all knowing and mischievously wicked Gemma she appears ready to run away with this picture. (And as always watch for a cameo by Ridley Scott's longtime partner Gianina Facio  I won't spoil your fun by telling you where she appears.) Again, there is nothing new or groundbreaking here. It will be compared to Under the Tuscan Sun and a long history of countless other films of this nature  an attractive woman or handsome bastard gets in touch with who they really are, gets back to basics and becomes who they were always meant to be.\n\nForgive me for taking this path, but the wine/film comparisons are inevitable with this one.\n\nLike most of the films made today the fresh elements in this film come from the particular vision of the film maker, the chemistry of the cast and the way all of it can come together in a charming and palatable fashion. In other words, the blending of the key ingredient's.\n\nIt all comes down to being a matter of chemistry, craftsmanship and preference. Chemistry causes the grape to ferment and become wine. Craftmanship and experience make that wine something worth drinking. Chemistry amongst the elements of a film  story, cast and setting makes these pieces form a cohesive whole. Craftsmanship and experience make it a palatable film.\n\nAnd the rest is simply a matter of taste.\n\nThough it lacks the crisp originality of a sauvignon blanc, the hipness of a pinot grigio or the bold edginess of a Cabernet, but the elements here come together to make a film that plays pleasantly over the tongue like a decent rose  easy to sip and enjoy and given the chance could well leave you with the warm glow of a late summer afternoon.\n\nBut enough with the wine clichés! You could easily take advantage of the value of a matinée or opt to wait for DVD, though neither will do the scenery justice. This sweetly charming film will hold up equally well as a date movie, a mid week escape or something that you can take Mom to.\n\nWorth a look.\n\n-Roo's Reviews","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89949,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This sweetly charming film will hold up equally well as a date movie, a mid week escape or something that you can take Mom to.\n\nWorth a look.\n\n-Roo's Reviews","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89949,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="pl">Covid: nowojorska kronika</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Pięciu młodych filmowców, mieszkańców Nowego Jorku pomiędzy 17. a 21. rokiem życia, decyduje się opowiedzieć o życiu swoich rodzin dotkniętych pierwszą falą pandemii wirusa COVID-19. Za pomocą kamer rejestrują codzienne zmagania i strach przed niepewnym jutrem. W ten sposób powstaje kameralny, a przy tym głęboko osobisty obraz ukazujący trudną sytuację zwykłych ludzi, będących jednocześnie kluczowymi dla funkcjonowania państwa pracownikami, na początku kryzysu wywołanego koronawirusem w kraju rozdartym nierównościami społecznymi. W produkcji wykorzystano oryginalne animacje Rosemary Colón-Martinez.</desc>

His life changes when an invitation from the heavyweight champ Apollo Creed is given to him.\n\nRomance, Drama, Fight.\n\nStory- With minimum resources and low money, this movie was an underdog itself. Stallone wrote it and fought to play Rocky. When they were low on resources, they changed the story all together and made it even better. The story is flawless and keeps you on the edge of your seat. 9/10 \n\nMusic- The best thing about the movie itself. The music in this movie is guaranteed to give you goosebumps every time you watch it. Bill Conti gives you an excellent score throughout the movie, including the famous "gonna fly now". 10/10 \n\nActing- 4 nominated performances in this movie. The acting is very good as well, especially Burgess Meredith who offers one of the greatest acts I have ever seen. Stallone plays Rocky Balboa and changes his voice very well to be Rocky. He did a very good job. Talia Shire plays Adrian, a shy pet store owner who has never had a BF before. She did a good job as well. Burt Young plays the drunkard Paulie. Burgess Merideth plays the boxing trainer Mickey.

His life changes when an invitation from the heavyweight champ Apollo Creed is given to him.\n\nRomance, Drama, Fight.\n\nStory- With minimum resources and low money, this movie was an underdog itself. Stallone wrote it and fought to play Rocky. When they were low on resources, they changed the story all together and made it even better. The story is flawless and keeps you on the edge of your seat. 9/10 \n\nMusic- The best thing about the movie itself. The music in this movie is guaranteed to give you goosebumps every time you watch it. Bill Conti gives you an excellent score throughout the movie, including the famous "gonna fly now". 10/10 \n\nActing- 4 nominated performances in this movie. The acting is very good as well, especially Burgess Meredith who offers one of the greatest acts I have ever seen. Stallone plays Rocky Balboa and changes his voice very well to be Rocky. He did a very good job. Talia Shire plays Adrian, a shy pet store owner who has never had a BF before. She did a good job as well. Burt Young plays the drunkard Paulie.

I'm not trying to say that if it was weak that I could enjoy it because I thought it would be weak and was prepared for that, but just that the film needs to deliver what it proposes to do and satisfy on those terms – which given how many poor comedies and blockbusters come out of Hollywood, is not as easy as it sounds.\n\nFortunately, ILYM does do this and it does it in a way that will please the majority of viewers.

(Max has however become a blend of Wall Street's Gordon Gecco and Capt. Aubrey  a cold power hungry cut-throat exterior with a bit of a romantic hedonist hiding a Depardieu-like charming buffoon locked inside.) Sir Ridley Scott makes it clear that the real star here is the Provencal countryside in all of its golden sun soaked glory. Russell is the fulcrum that moves us from one beautiful scene to the next, lightly shuffling and dancing in over-sized pajamas with a suit jacket and a tie for a belt.\n\nAnd oddly, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nAs obvious as the story line is (both in the book and the film) it remains absolutely charming and Crowe's performance is an essential part of what makes it work, hammy or no. He looks great and his trust in Scott as a director allows him to simply have fun here  a nice break from all of the heavy (and often heavy handed) Oscar bait bio-pics he's pigeonholed himself into recently.\n\nThe rest of the cast is picture perfect. I've been waiting to see when Freddie Highmore would play a young Russell and he's lovely here, big eyed and gracefully gawky as young Max. He holds his own against Albert Finney's lovingly blustery Uncle Henry. Marion Cotillard is gorgeous as Fanny and also sturdy enough to hold her own against both Max and Crowe himself. Abbie Cornish is pretty and sweet and her American accent is damn near perfect. Isabelle Candelier is a colorful counterpoint to Max's stuffy British ways, but it is Didier Bourdon who nearly walks away with the picture. His is a character we haven't seen done a million times before and whose eyes hint at a story equal in richness to the Château itself. Archie Panjabi is Max's assistant, a character created for the film. As the all knowing and mischievously wicked Gemma she appears ready to run away with this picture.

(Max has however become a blend of Wall Street's Gordon Gecco and Capt. Aubrey  a cold power hungry cut-throat exterior with a bit of a romantic hedonist hiding a Depardieu-like charming buffoon locked inside.) Sir Ridley Scott makes it clear that the real star here is the Provencal countryside in all of its golden sun soaked glory. Russell is the fulcrum that moves us from one beautiful scene to the next, lightly shuffling and dancing in over-sized pajamas with a suit jacket and a tie for a belt.\n\nAnd oddly, this isn't necessarily a bad thing.\n\nAs obvious as the story line is (both in the book and the film) it remains absolutely charming and Crowe's performance is an essential part of what makes it work, hammy or no. He looks great and his trust in Scott as a director allows him to simply have fun here  a nice break from all of the heavy (and often heavy handed) Oscar bait bio-pics he's pigeonholed himself into recently.\n\nThe rest of the cast is picture perfect. I've been waiting to see when Freddie Highmore would play a young Russell and he's lovely here, big eyed and gracefully gawky as young Max. He holds his own against Albert Finney's lovingly blustery Uncle Henry. Marion Cotillard is gorgeous as Fanny and also sturdy enough to hold her own against both Max and Crowe himself. Abbie Cornish is pretty and sweet and her American accent is damn near perfect. Isabelle Candelier is a colorful counterpoint to Max's stuffy British ways, but it is Didier Bourdon who nearly walks away with the picture. His is a character we haven't seen done a million times before and whose eyes hint at a story equal in richness to the Château itself. Archie Panjabi is Max's assistant, a character created for the film. As the all knowing and mischievously wicked Gemma she appears ready to run away with this picture. (And as always watch for a cameo by Ridley Scott's longtime partner Gianina Facio  I won't spoil your fun by telling you where she appears.) Again, there is nothing new or groundbreaking here. It will be compared to Under the Tuscan Sun and a long history of countless other films of this nature  an attractive woman or handsome bastard gets in touch with who they really are, gets back to basics and becomes who they were always meant to be.\n\nForgive me for taking this path, but the wine/film comparisons are inevitable with this one.\n\nLike most of the films made today the fresh elements in this film come from the particular vision of the film maker, the chemistry of the cast and the way all of it can come together in a charming and palatable fashion. In other words, the blending of the key ingredient's.\n\nIt all comes down to being a matter of chemistry, craftsmanship and preference. Chemistry causes the grape to ferment and become wine.

    <desc lang="pl">Pięciu młodych filmowców, mieszkańców Nowego Jorku pomiędzy 17. a 21. rokiem życia, decyduje się opowiedzieć o życiu swoich rodzin dotkniętych pierwszą falą pandemii wirusa COVID-19. Za pomocą kamer rejestrują codzienne zmagania i strach przed niepewnym jutrem. W ten sposób powstaje kameralny, a przy tym głęboko osobisty obraz ukazujący trudną sytuację zwykłych ludzi, będących jednocześnie kluczowymi dla funkcjonowania państwa pracownikami, na początku kryzysu wywołanego koronawirusem w kraju rozdartym nierównościami społecznymi. W produkcji wykorzystano oryginalne animacje Rosemary Colón-Martinez.</desc>

The film has a good twisting plot and Jack Reacher is a mix between James Bond and John McLane from Die Hard. There are some memorable characters and the film draws you in and makes you think. The plot is easy to follow but complex enough to keep you interested without giving you brain ache. In short I liked Jack Reacher and look forward to more films with Jack. \n\nThe plot has plenty of fast action scenes which are thankfully not too over the top and keep the pace of the film going. The ending was also well thought out despite the slightly cheesy last few lines. But they do leave the character ready for follow up films.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":314755,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The film has a good twisting plot and Jack Reacher is a mix between James Bond and John McLane from Die Hard. There are some memorable characters and the film draws you in and makes you think. The plot is easy to follow but complex enough to keep you interested without giving you brain ache. In short I liked Jack Reacher and look forward to more films with Jack. \n\nThe plot has plenty of fast action scenes which are thankfully not too over the top and keep the pace of the film going. The ending was also well thought out despite the slightly cheesy last few lines. But they do leave the character ready for follow up films.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":314755,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="pl">Jestem numerem cztery</title>
    <desc lang="pl">John Smith niczym się nie wyróżnia na tle innych nastolatków mieszkających w prowincjonalnym miasteczku w stanie Ohio. W rzeczywistości jest on jednak jednym z dziewięciu uciekinierów z planety Lorien, którzy ukryli się na Ziemi, gdy ich rodzimymi terenami zawładnęli przedstawiciele wrogiej rasy. Chłopak nie zdaje sobie sprawy, że wciąż grozi mu niebezpieczeństwo. Uczy się w lokalnym liceum i zakochuje się w szkolnej piękności Sarah. Wspólne plany burzy nagłe pojawienie się okrutnych prześladowców z Lorien. Zabili oni już trzech zbiegów. Następny w kolejności jest John. By ocalić siebie i ukochaną, nastolatek musi stanąć do walki z wrogami. Może ich pokonać tylko w jeden sposób - używając swoich nadprzyrodzonych sił i jednocząc się z pozostałymi uchodźcami. Niczym anioł stróż czuwa nad nim Henri, który pomaga mu lepiej rozumieć samego siebie i kontrolować moce takie jak telekineza. Pochodząca z tej samej planety dziewczyna z numerem sześć potrafi natomiast znikać i zaskakiwać wroga, pojawiając się znienacka. Atuty te mogą jednak okazać się niewystarczające w starciu z potęgą prześladowcy.</desc>

As a big fan of the SAW series, the storyline and plot were pretty well written but the rest of the game was just a bit sloppy.\n\nYou play as Detective Tapp from the first SAW film. We all thought he died in the movie by Zep shooting him near the end of the film but we were all wrong. Jigsaw kidnaps him and saves his life. Jigsaw told Detective Tapp that after taking the bullet out of his body, he put in a key in him. This key is a way out of where Tapp and other Jigsaw's victims were currently in which is an abandon asylum. As Detective Tapp, your mission is to survive from maniacs that wants to kill you for the key, survive from Jigsaw's traps, rescuing important characters of the story, solve multiple puzzles, and try to crack the case on who is Jigsaw.\n\nThe game's story is pretty cool. You kind of get to know more a little of Jigsaw, witness characters from other SAW films and some just made for the game, and you actually make your own choice at the end of what you really want after what you experienced through the twisted world of the game. Those are the good things about the game.\n\nThe bad things about the game is mostly the graphics. The graphics of the Xbox360 version is got to be the worst graphics I've ever seen in this console. There's a handful of glitches and the smoothing texture is very delayed if you start from a checkpoint or skipping a cut-scene. The voice acting is a little bit strange. The only voice acting that is really good is Tobin Bell's work (Jigsaw). Everybody else felt like they're amateurs in acting. The controls are a bit strange as well. Later on in the game, you can make explosive traps with household products. You have them equipped but I haven't had a clue on how to plant the trap on the ground until near the end of the game that I can just simply press RT while equipped. It's like you have dementia and you have to figure it out yourself on how to use the controls in the game. If I were the makers of this game, I could have continue working and tweaking things up and plant the release date a month after SAW VI's release date.\n\nOverall, decent game but sloppy. You just have to get use to it. It's a must-have for SAW fans but for regular horror or video game buffs, It's safe to skip this one.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":711,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Zimny poranek w odkrywkowej kopalni kruszców. Krzysztof (Grzegorz Damięcki) zaczyna pierwszy dzień pracy na stanowisku kierownika. Wyraźnie nie pasuje on do środowiska pracowników fizycznych. W trosce o własną pozycję, zamierza trzymać dyscyplinę twardą ręką. Nagły wypadek, którego ofiarą staje się jeden z ukraińskich robotników, wystawia zasady moralne Krzysztofa na próbę. Zdaje on sobie sprawę z tego, że łatwo być stanowczym tylko w sprzyjających okolicznościach. Jednak trudno mu przeciwstawić się złu, kiedy w grę wchodzą dramatyczne konsekwencje.</desc>

Szybko okazuje się, że podróż autostopem nie jest tak ekscytująca, jak się wydawało, kiedy znajduje się w środku nocy na obrzeżach postkomunistycznego miasta. Dziewczyna dostrzega na moście postać, która niebezpiecznie balansuje na barierce. Tak poznaje niezrównoważonego dziwaka Chudego. Oboje postanawiają na jakiś czas obrać taki sam kierunek podróży. Pod osłoną nocy snują się po mieście, w coraz dziwniejsze rejony, doświadczając niezwykłych emocji. Wkrótce między Młodą a Chudym tworzy się nienazwana więź. Całość oparta jest na płaszczyźnie psychodelicznej jak z narkotycznego transu.</desc>

After the body of a local student is found in a forest, the police discover that she was murdered. A new teacher Pawel Zawadzki arrives at her school, but his reason for leaving his city job is unclear. From there develops a wonderful plot that encompasses local corruption, drug dealing and the overlapping worlds of students and adults, linked up by the desire of Pawel to discover the truth behind the girl's death. It is hard to describe in too much detail why this wonderfully shot and atmospheric thriller is so gripping, without giving too much away. Yet I hope I can persuade you to give this a go. I rarely waqtch TV, as so much of it is tripe, let alone be drawn into something so compelling that I would have happily binge watched this series.

    <desc lang="pl">Członkowie dwupokoleniowej rodziny próbują żyć ze świadomością o jej rozpadzie. Niektórzy starają się to akceptować i trwać w takiej rzeczywistości, a inni chcą się z niej wydostać. Liczne problemy, rozpadające się związki i rozwody negatywnie wpływają na stosunki międzyludzkie. Wszystko to odbija się na dzieciach, które w ten sposób tracą szansę na normalny rozwój. Przedstawiana historia widziana jest z perspektywy małego dziecka, obserwującego zachowania swoich rodziców. Rozgrywający się dramat ojca Janusza (Grzegorz Juchiewicz) uwidacznia bezsilność w bezwiednie zapoczątkowanej autodestrukcji.</desc>

As soon as this film started I knew it was one of the good ones. This movie is balls to the wall suspense.The crazy flashing images were just a plus. Ashley Bell is a fantastic actress, Im not one to study movement or expressions but she really shined through in a movie that really just is a typical game of Cat &amp; Mouse. The formula has been done before, but it works for me because of its stylish feel. I appreciate some of the shots of the film, such as a ditch being in the middle of our focus from birds eye view, and our main actress walking around it. The acting from the others are a bit cringe worthy but despite them the suspense and tension still never wears off. I went into this with high expectations (expecting a popcorn type of thriller of course,) and for the most part it was worth while. Check it out when it comes to Redbox or possibly Netflix.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3314,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As soon as this film started I knew it was one of the good ones. This movie is balls to the wall suspense.The crazy flashing images were just a plus. Ashley Bell is a fantastic actress, Im not one to study movement or expressions but she really shined through in a movie that really just is a typical game of Cat &amp; Mouse. The formula has been done before, but it works for me because of its stylish feel. I appreciate some of the shots of the film, such as a ditch being in the middle of our focus from birds eye view, and our main actress walking around it. The acting from the others are a bit cringe worthy but despite them the suspense and tension still never wears off. I went into this with high expectations (expecting a popcorn type of thriller of course,) and for the most part it was worth while. Check it out when it comes to Redbox or possibly Netflix.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3314,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Chłopiec opowiada o tajemniczym odkryciu swojej jedynej przyjaciółce, Sarah Whittle. Podczas nieobecności opiekunów obydwoje rozpoczynają zabawę. Wtedy dochodzi do nieprzewidzianych zdarzeń. Nagle w pokoju pojawiają się nietoperze, a chłopiec zostaje wessany przez grę i znika. Przerażona dziewczynka ucieka. Mija 26 lat. Grę odnajduje rodzeństwo - Judy (Kirsten Dunst) i Peter (Bradley Pierce). Gdy tylko rzucają kostką, w domu pojawia się dorosły Alan (Robin Williams). Postanawia on odszukać swoją przyjaciółkę z dzieciństwa, Sarah (Bonnie Hunt). Niestety, okazuje się, że za mężczyzną przybyły groźne zwierzęta i okrutny myśliwy. By odesłać ich z powrotem, trzeba dokończyć śmiertelnie niebezpieczną rozgrywkę. Saturn za najlepsze efekty specjalne i dla Bonnie Hunt - najlepszej aktorki drugoplanowej oraz nominacja do tej nagrody dla małej Kirsten Dunst.</desc>

For example, Tony and Ziva: for weeks and weeks, he has been trying to get her back from Israel and get her to love him. This has become so tiresome...tiresome...tiresome.\n\nAnd Gibbs storyline involving shooting down some of his own friends is to far out of his to-date character line that it is amost comical, to say the least.\n\nPlease, Writers, whatever you do, please get OFF this track.

The ideal mother of her time and circumstances and the wife a man would fight for.\n\nMark Ruffalo is at the centre of it all with his charming, childlike and exuberant portrayal. He masters the manic episodes, the frailty, the fears, the hopes, the joys and the underlying deep love for his wife and kids.\n\nThe kids, one played by Maya Forbes's own daughter, are really adorable and act at a very high calibre. Creative, funny, aware and awkwardly accepting their weird family antics with a touch of rebellion.\n\nUltimately most of the credit is due to Maya's inventing and passionate storytelling in its form, content, message and lasting meaning. A film that is very human and difficult, but finds glimpse of beauty in little things that we should all hold dear. \n\nAn easy but complex crowd-pleaser with much meat and mastery for the critics and film aficionados.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15378,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A landmark first feature that has enough laughs but loads of conflicting emotions.\n\nZoe Saldana is a strong presence with her loving/loathing/longing and everything in between character. The ideal mother of her time and circumstances and the wife a man would fight for.\n\nMark Ruffalo is at the centre of it all with his charming, childlike and exuberant portrayal. He masters the manic episodes, the frailty, the fears, the hopes, the joys and the underlying deep love for his wife and kids.\n\nThe kids, one played by Maya Forbes's own daughter, are really adorable and act at a very high calibre. Creative, funny, aware and awkwardly accepting their weird family antics with a touch of rebellion.\n\nUltimately most of the credit is due to Maya's inventing and passionate storytelling in its form, content, message and lasting meaning. A film that is very human and difficult, but finds glimpse of beauty in little things that we should all hold dear. \n\nAn easy but complex crowd-pleaser with much meat and mastery for the critics and film aficionados.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15378,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
