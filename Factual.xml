This is a film that develops slowly, is mostly quiet, and can be frustrating. It builds slowly, scene upon scene, to tell the story of a country damaged by war with those left forced to think about their motivations and what comes next. I didn't quite know what I was watching until the end when I was pleasantly surprised that everything added up to a new kind of film that was quite worth my attention. There is nothing sci-fi about this so don't get your hopes up. This film is, however, absolutely beautiful to look at and has a strong directorial point of view, examining environment, machine, space, and our relation to them.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1379,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was expecting this movie to be the nail in the coffin for the Spongebob franchise, and I was legitimately concerned that I would never see a good thing come from the series ever again. Boy was I wrong. Sponge Out of Water is an absolute TREAT for both old and new fans of the series alike, and the movie kept me entertained to the very end. The 2D animation is the best animation I have seen in a LONG time. I found every frame enjoyable, and it almost has a Ren and Stimpy like feel to it which made me appreciate it so much more. (If you ever watch/re-watch this movie, take a good look at the facial animations during the 2D parts, they're absolutely brilliant). Not only this, but the jokes and gags are hilarious, and only occasionally fall short, but when they do, they make sure to make up for it. (Listen for the "my leg!" recurring gag!). Also this movie is sure to leave you wondering "what will happen next?!" As you can never quite predict what the writers will throw out at you (others have compared this movie to an acid trip, and I don't want to spoil anything, but I found it a rather enjoyable one) The only thing I did not like was the "superpowers" part, (this was the part that turned me off in the first place) as I felt some of them tried "too hard" to make the audience laugh, and it just didn't feel like Spongebob. Thankfully this part only lasts about 20 minutes, and moves onto one of the greatest movie endings, tying it up all in a bow with a nice rap battle that came out of nowhere (Creators of Epic Rap Battles of History), and some interpretative dance from Squidward that parodies his famous dance moves from a previous episode. All in all, this movie would have been a 10/10 if Spongebob stayed anchored, and never had left the water. The live action visuals were impressive, but during those scenes, the comedy hit a dry spell until the last moments of the movie. If you're a long time fan of Spongebob, this is a great movie to relive your childhood a little bit more. (Hopefully the new season of the TV show will be just as good!)

In the West, he is known through his latest films (Shaolin Soccer and Kung Fu Hustle), but in the East he's been a comedy phenomenon for years. He started his career in the early 90s as an actor, launched by several famous Hong Kong directors. It didn't take him long to start directing films himself, which brought him his current fame.\n\nA new Chow film is probably the most important public film event throughout the larger part of Asia. That said, the stakes were high for CJ7.\n\nChow is best known for his typical comedy formula: a mix of Hong-Kong humor, parody and crazy special effects that make his films stand out from the crowd. In that sense, CJ7 will be a surprise to many viewers. Talking about viewer expectations, Chow's new film could be compared to Danny Boyle's Millions. A film from a director that throws himself at the children's market without losing too much of its own identity, but with the chance of losing many of its initial fans.\n\nCJ7 contains enough typical Chow humor to make it recognizable, but at the same time CJ7 is targeted at a younger audience, with many themes lifted directly from other children's films. Take ET, add some Totoro, mix it with Chow's comedy and what you have is something close to CJ7. It's probably a good thing to realize this before going into the movie, as many will go in with the wrong idea and will be left disappointed by the film.\n\nIf you get used to the idea that this film is a bit different from Chow's other films, it turns out to be a pretty sweet, nifty and funny film after all. Most of the main roles are played by small kids, and they do a pretty great job. The main role is a bit too soft maybe, but the mini-triad kid is hilarious, the fat kids are plain weird (I wonder how they were filmed) and the little girl is really too cute.\n\nOf course there's also the alien, which is a cuddly little animal. It's digitally created but feels like a living, breathing, rubber bath toy. An awesome creation that plays a large part in the film's charm. To make it complete, Chow himself takes on the role of the father, which he does well (as usual). I think Chow's style of acting can easily put people off, as he seems pretty aware of the comedic scenes he's delivering (much like Takeshi Kitano), but his presence on screen is warm and compelling enough not to be bothered by it.\n\nThe film looks pretty lush and colorful, Chow really made some progress in the visual department. Although the special effect are still behind Hollywood standards, Chow keeps them functional and funny at all times, which makes the lacking technical qualities easy to forgive. The soundtrack could have been a bit less dramatic I think, although I guess those are the downsides of making a film mostly targeted at kids.\n\nCJ7 is still a funny film, though the number and range of gags is a lot smaller. They are replaced by a pretty typical but warm children's tale. The result is a film that could charm you as easily as it could disappoint you. Chow is enough of a director to pull it off, but those wanting another typical Chow comedy will be left with empty hands. Those willing to go along with Chow's fluff will be treated to a fun and cutesy film. 4.0*/5.0*","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14881,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The 2D animation is the best animation I have seen in a LONG time. I found every frame enjoyable, and it almost has a Ren and Stimpy like feel to it which made me appreciate it so much more. (If you ever watch/re-watch this movie, take a good look at the facial animations during the 2D parts, they're absolutely brilliant). Not only this, but the jokes and gags are hilarious, and only occasionally fall short, but when they do, they make sure to make up for it. (Listen for the "my leg!" recurring gag!). Also this movie is sure to leave you wondering "what will happen next?!" As you can never quite predict what the writers will throw out at you (others have compared this movie to an acid trip, and I don't want to spoil anything, but I found it a rather enjoyable one) The only thing I did not like was the "superpowers" part, (this was the part that turned me off in the first place) as I felt some of them tried "too hard" to make the audience laugh, and it just didn't feel like Spongebob. Thankfully this part only lasts about 20 minutes, and moves onto one of the greatest movie endings, tying it up all in a bow with a nice rap battle that came out of nowhere (Creators of Epic Rap Battles of History), and some interpretative dance from Squidward that parodies his famous dance moves from a previous episode. All in all, this movie would have been a 10/10 if Spongebob stayed anchored, and never had left the water. The live action visuals were impressive, but during those scenes, the comedy hit a dry spell until the last moments of the movie. If you're a long time fan of Spongebob, this is a great movie to relive your childhood a little bit more. (Hopefully the new season of the TV show will be just as good!) Go see this movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Then Lynch, by means of a weird machine called Animus , explores the records of his ancestor Aguilar: Michael Fassbender himself , and to be aware he is an undercover descendant of a member who belongs to a mysterious sect . Lynch gets skills as a Master Assassin , facing off the eerie secret society of the Templars in Granada, where Spanish kings Ferdinand and Isabella are taking over the last Muslim fortress in Spain . Meanwhile, the obscure order of Templars quest for the magic relic : "The Apple of Eden" which bears the key to control human freedom. Welcome to the Spanish Inquisition. Your destiny is in your blood . Enter the Animus. It's time to make history. Our survival is locked in his past. We work in the Dark, to serve the Light. We are Assassins. Nothing is True . Everything is Permitted.\n\nA strange plot freely based on the famous game in which a condemned prisoner unlocks his genetic memories and experimenting the adventures of an ancestor in 15th Century . Concerning a dark brotherhood nicknamed "The Assassins" that protects ¨The Apple of Eden¨ against the known Templars , an opressive and powerful Knights Order. There is a historical setting as King Ferdinand of Spain and Queen Isabella are besiegeing the Granada kingdom where rules the last Muslim ruler , Boabdil . And other historic figures as Torquemada who presided Inquisition trial , being played by Javier Gutierrez, this character was even performed by Marlon Brando himself in "1492 the Discovery" (1992) by John Glen . As well as appearance by Christopher Columbus embarking on Palos de Moguer Huelva to discover America , being briefly played by Gabriel Andreu . Decent main cast and support cast delivering acceptable interpretations . Michael Fassbender gives a passable acting as the brave convict , sentenced to lethal injection , who discovers he is descended from a bizarre secret society and then he will attempt to stop the nasty Templars . Marion Cotillard is the heroine who runs a revolutionary technology at the Abstergo Company that fakes deaths and takes condemned people to practice them rare experiments . Jeremy Irons is her father called Alan Rikkin, the CEO of the technological enterprise . Secondary cast is pretty good, such as : Charlotte Rampling, Michael Kenneth Williams , Matias Varela , Essie Davies as Cal's mother , Brendan Gleeson and his son Brian Gleeson . And with plenty of Latin actors playing Spanish people as Carlos Bardem, Javier Gutierrez as Torquemada , Gabriel Andreu as Colón , Julio Jordán and Juan Pablo Shuk .And Arab actors interpreting Muslim roles : Kemaal Elis as Price Ahmed and Abdella as Sultan Muhammad.\n\nIt packs colorful and evocative cinematography by Adam Arkapaw . Although excessive use of regular Chrome and abundant 3D Computer Generator . Shot on location, mostly in Spain : Sevilla , Alhambra of Granada, Cabo Gata, desert Tabernas, Almeria, and Island of Malta, and London. As well as thrilling and moving musical score by Kurzel , director's brother . The picture was professional but regularly directed by Justin Kurzel who has made a few films as ¨The story of the Kelly Gang¨, ¨The turning¨, ¨Snowtown¨ and his greatest hit : ¨Macbeth¨ that was also played by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, in fact during this shooting , actor/producer Fassbender convinced Justin to make ¨Assassin's Creed¨. Rating : 5.5/10. Acceptable and passable. The motion picture will appeal to Michael Fassbender , Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons fans.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":189032,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Then Lynch, by means of a weird machine called Animus , explores the records of his ancestor Aguilar: Michael Fassbender himself , and to be aware he is an undercover descendant of a member who belongs to a mysterious sect . Lynch gets skills as a Master Assassin , facing off the eerie secret society of the Templars in Granada, where Spanish kings Ferdinand and Isabella are taking over the last Muslim fortress in Spain . Meanwhile, the obscure order of Templars quest for the magic relic : "The Apple of Eden" which bears the key to control human freedom. Welcome to the Spanish Inquisition. Your destiny is in your blood . Enter the Animus. It's time to make history. Our survival is locked in his past. We work in the Dark, to serve the Light. We are Assassins. Nothing is True . Everything is Permitted.\n\nA strange plot freely based on the famous game in which a condemned prisoner unlocks his genetic memories and experimenting the adventures of an ancestor in 15th Century . Concerning a dark brotherhood nicknamed "The Assassins" that protects ¨The Apple of Eden¨ against the known Templars , an opressive and powerful Knights Order. There is a historical setting as King Ferdinand of Spain and Queen Isabella are besiegeing the Granada kingdom where rules the last Muslim ruler , Boabdil . And other historic figures as Torquemada who presided Inquisition trial , being played by Javier Gutierrez, this character was even performed by Marlon Brando himself in "1492 the Discovery" (1992) by John Glen . As well as appearance by Christopher Columbus embarking on Palos de Moguer Huelva to discover America , being briefly played by Gabriel Andreu . Decent main cast and support cast delivering acceptable interpretations . Michael Fassbender gives a passable acting as the brave convict , sentenced to lethal injection , who discovers he is descended from a bizarre secret society and then he will attempt to stop the nasty Templars . Marion Cotillard is the heroine who runs a revolutionary technology at the Abstergo Company that fakes deaths and takes condemned people to practice them rare experiments . Jeremy Irons is her father called Alan Rikkin, the CEO of the technological enterprise . Secondary cast is pretty good, such as : Charlotte Rampling, Michael Kenneth Williams , Matias Varela , Essie Davies as Cal's mother , Brendan Gleeson and his son Brian Gleeson . And with plenty of Latin actors playing Spanish people as Carlos Bardem, Javier Gutierrez as Torquemada , Gabriel Andreu as Colón , Julio Jordán and Juan Pablo Shuk .And Arab actors interpreting Muslim roles : Kemaal Elis as Price Ahmed and Abdella as Sultan Muhammad.\n\nIt packs colorful and evocative cinematography by Adam Arkapaw . Although excessive use of regular Chrome and abundant 3D Computer Generator . Shot on location, mostly in Spain : Sevilla , Alhambra of Granada, Cabo Gata, desert Tabernas, Almeria, and Island of Malta, and London. As well as thrilling and moving musical score by Kurzel , director's brother . The picture was professional but regularly directed by Justin Kurzel who has made a few films as ¨The story of the Kelly Gang¨, ¨The turning¨, ¨Snowtown¨ and his greatest hit : ¨Macbeth¨ that was also played by Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard, in fact during this shooting , actor/producer Fassbender convinced Justin to make ¨Assassin's Creed¨. Rating : 5.5/10. Acceptable and passable. The motion picture will appeal to Michael Fassbender , Marion Cotillard and Jeremy Irons fans.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":189032,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Then Lynch, by means of a weird machine called Animus , explores the records of his ancestor Aguilar: Michael Fassbender himself , and to be aware he is an undercover descendant of a member who belongs to a mysterious sect . Lynch gets skills as a Master Assassin , facing off the eerie secret society of the Templars in Granada, where Spanish kings Ferdinand and Isabella are taking over the last Muslim fortress in Spain . Meanwhile, the obscure order of Templars quest for the magic relic : "The Apple of Eden" which bears the key to control human freedom. Welcome to the Spanish Inquisition. Your destiny is in your blood . Enter the Animus. It's time to make history. Our survival is locked in his past. We work in the Dark, to serve the Light. We are Assassins. Nothing is True . Everything is Permitted.\n\nA strange plot freely based on the famous game in which a condemned prisoner unlocks his genetic memories and experimenting the adventures of an ancestor in 15th Century .

There is a historical setting as King Ferdinand of Spain and Queen Isabella are besiegeing the Granada kingdom where rules the last Muslim ruler , Boabdil . And other historic figures as Torquemada who presided Inquisition trial , being played by Javier Gutierrez, this character was even performed by Marlon Brando himself in "1492 the Discovery" (1992) by John Glen . As well as appearance by Christopher Columbus embarking on Palos de Moguer Huelva to discover America , being briefly played by Gabriel Andreu . Decent main cast and support cast delivering acceptable interpretations . Michael Fassbender gives a passable acting as the brave convict , sentenced to lethal injection , who discovers he is descended from a bizarre secret society and then he will attempt to stop the nasty Templars . Marion Cotillard is the heroine who runs a revolutionary technology at the Abstergo Company that fakes deaths and takes condemned people to practice them rare experiments .

His portrayal of August was amazing, he made him likable and interesting and I was always compelled by his scenes. The character reminded me a lot of Miles in "King Kong" (played by Jack Black), a character that also wanted fame and success more than anything and used questionable and even cruel methods to get it. He was terrifying in some scenes too, but always believable. Also, in the beginning of the movie i really felt the chemistry between August and Marlena, which made the character even more interesting; however, I did feel like Jacob and Marlena had chemistry too, and in my opinion this way it was more realistic (both men loved her and she also cared about both of them). \n\nI loved the movie, and I really recommend it to everyone.

It's not. It's about 3 wives of gangsters who do their husbands dirty work while the husbands are locked up. They pack pistols. Fight, and deal with slimy gangsters.\n\nNothing stood out at all in movie. Script was average nothing overly brilliant.\n\nIt was just ok.

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long "suffering" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.\n\n I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":421122,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

From the beginning with Gabriel (I always love Johnathan Pryce - I never got over "Brazil") and the old Cole Porter together in the empty theatre, I was sold on the film. Sometimes flashbacks annoy me. In this case, the interaction (one-sided, but still there) between the old Cole Porter and his past made the transition to his life magical and fun. It didn't feel like a biographical view of his life.\n\nFrom the opening scene in the theatre, it just got better as it went along. Kevin Kline's portrayal of Cole Porter was rich and nuanced. He seemed to be truly in love with Linda, yet he still had his other side. Ashley Judd as Linda seemed perfect. When the old Cole Porter sees her again, he says, "My god, she was lovely!" and she was. I identified enough with her and with Kevin Kline that I was saddened by her death in the movie. They sold me on their characters. I ended up feeling empathy for Linda; the lovely, lovable and steadfast; and respect and admiration for the Cole Porter figure.\n\nBut, what made the movie fly for me was the music (go figure!). It was Cole Porter, release 1.1. A bunch of his great songs were re-arranged and presented by modern singers - all the way from jazz (Diane Krall) to varieties of pop (Elvis Costello). Each of the singers brought a new feel to the Cole Porter songs and really made the movie a pleasure.\n\nWhen my wife and I finished the movie on the DVD we spent another hour watching all the special features. We both hated to see the movie end. We just wanted it to go on and on. Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom.........","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10968,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

From the beginning with Gabriel (I always love Johnathan Pryce - I never got over "Brazil") and the old Cole Porter together in the empty theatre, I was sold on the film. Sometimes flashbacks annoy me. In this case, the interaction (one-sided, but still there) between the old Cole Porter and his past made the transition to his life magical and fun. It didn't feel like a biographical view of his life.\n\nFrom the opening scene in the theatre, it just got better as it went along. Kevin Kline's portrayal of Cole Porter was rich and nuanced. He seemed to be truly in love with Linda, yet he still had his other side. Ashley Judd as Linda seemed perfect. When the old Cole Porter sees her again, he says, "My god, she was lovely!" and she was. I identified enough with her and with Kevin Kline that I was saddened by her death in the movie. They sold me on their characters. I ended up feeling empathy for Linda; the lovely, lovable and steadfast; and respect and admiration for the Cole Porter figure.\n\nBut, what made the movie fly for me was the music (go figure!). It was Cole Porter, release 1.1. A bunch of his great songs were re-arranged and presented by modern singers - all the way from jazz (Diane Krall) to varieties of pop (Elvis Costello). Each of the singers brought a new feel to the Cole Porter songs and really made the movie a pleasure.\n\nWhen my wife and I finished the movie on the DVD we spent another hour watching all the special features. We both hated to see the movie end. We just wanted it to go on and on. Like the beat, beat, beat of the tom-tom.........","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10968,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Director Shane Black loved the term and chose it as the movie's title because, "it so clearly represented what this film is." And what exactly is this film? Good question. For starters, it's original. It's a nice change of pace from all of the sequels and remakes we've been inundated with recently. I needed this breath of fresh air after being blind-sided by the news that a remake of Robocop might be on its way.\n\nIt's also funny and action-packed. The pace comes at us almost as quickly as the clever dialogue, making it nearly impossible for the average viewer to get bored. You may be offended, you may not appreciate the dark humor, and you may not get the style, but I would predict the majority of you won't get bored. Will I refund your ticket money if you *do* get bored? No, absolutely not. Don't be silly. I'll just say, "Oh well, I guess you're just in the minority on this one!" What I like most about Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is it's so hard to "genre-lize." See what I did there? Add that term to the Movie Mark Dictionary. When you can't "genre-lize" something then you can't easily force it into any one specific genre. Clever, huh? That's what makes Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang so fun. Is there action? Yes! After all, it's by the same guy who wrote the Lethal Weapon movies. But it's not an action movie.\n\nIs there humor? Indeed. The laughs mostly come from the chemistry between Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. and some of the crazy situations they find themselves in. This is my kind of dark humor. I love to be caught off guard by unexpected moments that make me laugh at things that might not be so funny if they were witnessed in the real world. But this isn't a comedy. The humor is never forced and doesn't have to resort to slapstick or flatulent puppies just to get cheap laughs. Sure, there's a scene that involves peeing on a corpse, but it has to be seen in its context to be appreciated.\n\nIf I were forced to affix a label to this then I suppose I'd say it's a darkly comedic murder mystery. It takes itself just seriously enough to keep you in suspense, but it's irreverent enough to simply be fun and entertaining. It works well enough as a farce without ever coming off as a pure parody.\n\nMy main complaint is that the story does get a little too confusing. I admit that I openly mocked other reviews that called the story "needlessly complex," but now that I have seen it I totally understand what these reviews are talking about. You'll want to pay careful attention or you'll get lost pretty quickly. I'd even suggest taking notes. If you're not careful you'll become so immersed with keeping up with the rapid-fire dialogue that you could lose focus on the plot details. It's not mind-blowing, but there are just so many characters and minutiae to keep up with that it's easy to lose track of what exactly is going on. If your friends call you "ol' goldfish attention span" then you could be in trouble.\n\nI'm not going to lie to you and tell you that this movie is for everybody. The language gets pretty rough, there is strong sexual content, Val Kilmer is a detective who just happens to be gay and jokes are made at his expense, there's a decent amount of gunplay, and some people just might not appreciate the unconventionality on display.\n\nBut I loved the fact that this wasn't formulaic and that the look and style was different than the norm. Black admits to de-saturating the colors in post-production to give the film a crude, rough look. Perhaps some might like their movies a little more bright, but I thought it was quite effective at giving the film the pulp detective story vibe that Black was going for.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this to my mother, so I won't pretend to know whether this fits *your* taste either. It all depends on how you view these kinds of things. Is it gratuitous or knowingly over-the-top? Clever or too clever for its own good? Cheesy or comfortable in its self-awareness? Ask yourself what it takes to offend your senses and let that be your guide.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":218046,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Director Shane Black loved the term and chose it as the movie's title because, "it so clearly represented what this film is." And what exactly is this film? Good question. For starters, it's original. It's a nice change of pace from all of the sequels and remakes we've been inundated with recently. I needed this breath of fresh air after being blind-sided by the news that a remake of Robocop might be on its way.\n\nIt's also funny and action-packed. The pace comes at us almost as quickly as the clever dialogue, making it nearly impossible for the average viewer to get bored. You may be offended, you may not appreciate the dark humor, and you may not get the style, but I would predict the majority of you won't get bored. Will I refund your ticket money if you *do* get bored? No, absolutely not. Don't be silly. I'll just say, "Oh well, I guess you're just in the minority on this one!" What I like most about Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is it's so hard to "genre-lize." See what I did there? Add that term to the Movie Mark Dictionary. When you can't "genre-lize" something then you can't easily force it into any one specific genre. Clever, huh? That's what makes Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang so fun. Is there action? Yes! After all, it's by the same guy who wrote the Lethal Weapon movies. But it's not an action movie.\n\nIs there humor? Indeed. The laughs mostly come from the chemistry between Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. and some of the crazy situations they find themselves in. This is my kind of dark humor. I love to be caught off guard by unexpected moments that make me laugh at things that might not be so funny if they were witnessed in the real world. But this isn't a comedy. The humor is never forced and doesn't have to resort to slapstick or flatulent puppies just to get cheap laughs. Sure, there's a scene that involves peeing on a corpse, but it has to be seen in its context to be appreciated.\n\nIf I were forced to affix a label to this then I suppose I'd say it's a darkly comedic murder mystery. It takes itself just seriously enough to keep you in suspense, but it's irreverent enough to simply be fun and entertaining. It works well enough as a farce without ever coming off as a pure parody.\n\nMy main complaint is that the story does get a little too confusing. I admit that I openly mocked other reviews that called the story "needlessly complex," but now that I have seen it I totally understand what these reviews are talking about. You'll want to pay careful attention or you'll get lost pretty quickly. I'd even suggest taking notes. If you're not careful you'll become so immersed with keeping up with the rapid-fire dialogue that you could lose focus on the plot details. It's not mind-blowing, but there are just so many characters and minutiae to keep up with that it's easy to lose track of what exactly is going on. If your friends call you "ol' goldfish attention span" then you could be in trouble.\n\nI'm not going to lie to you and tell you that this movie is for everybody. The language gets pretty rough, there is strong sexual content, Val Kilmer is a detective who just happens to be gay and jokes are made at his expense, there's a decent amount of gunplay, and some people just might not appreciate the unconventionality on display.\n\nBut I loved the fact that this wasn't formulaic and that the look and style was different than the norm. Black admits to de-saturating the colors in post-production to give the film a crude, rough look. Perhaps some might like their movies a little more bright, but I thought it was quite effective at giving the film the pulp detective story vibe that Black was going for.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this to my mother, so I won't pretend to know whether this fits *your* taste either. It all depends on how you view these kinds of things. Is it gratuitous or knowingly over-the-top? Clever or too clever for its own good? Cheesy or comfortable in its self-awareness? Ask yourself what it takes to offend your senses and let that be your guide.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":218046,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Ruining friendships, manipulating, gaslighting, not taking responsibility for your actions, pretty much being a narcissist not cool.\n\nSebastian Stan and Jamie Dornan have life experience of being in their 30's so of course it's believable. But Shailene Woodley was cast to be a "30 something" yet she's still in her 20's, late 20's to exact and it shows. She doesn't even have that experience yet of being a 30 something.\n\nAlso for once it would be nice to see Sebastian Stan in a role where he's not just the "bad boy".\n\nI now refer to this movie as "The movie that ruined my Ben&amp;Jerry's Ice Cream, it was that bad"","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4240,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There's a specular escape in Spain, an explosion in MI6 headquarters London and a chase on the River Thames to apprehend an assassin (Sicillian star, Maria Grazia Cucinotta) that climaxes at the Millennium Dome. All this action before the James Bond title song and it's carried out not just for show, but as it's all part of the story's later developments.\n\nMichael Apted directs the 19th Bond instalment in which Brosnan gives his finest performance as 007, he appears, confident, intellectual, more dangerous and authentic as the spy. In this he is injured and carries his ailment throughout the film, making him more vulnerable and real in life threaten situations, leaving the entertaining but bland Tomorrow Never Dies behind. \n\nFor the most part this instalment is more grounded and played serious with fewer gags than in previous Bonds, certainly less than Moore's outings. A lot of this is due to Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein screenplay which lends itself as a mystery, whodunit thriller theme and the villains, have more shades of grey as well as the heroes.\n\nDespite, Denise Richards beauty with brains role as Dr. Christmas Jones, she still appears as the typical Bond girl by the end. Robert Carlyle character Renard is given depth and ulterior motives as the villain but he still is cliché Bond Villain with scars. This aside, Sophie Marceau is excellent as femme fatale oil baron heiress Elektra King and M's (Judie Dench) late friends daughter. Dench is given more to do and shines on screen, and regulars Desmond Llewelyn (Q), Samantha Bond (Miss Moneypenny) and Colin Salmon reprise their roles. Robbie Coltrane makes a welcomed return as Zukovsky to briefly assist Bond, and Goldie makes an appearance as a henchman. Comedy legend John Cleese plays Q's side kick R. \n\nThe music score and Barry's trademark theme comes in just at the right moments to heighten the action on screen. And as a bonus the title songs music is interlaced throughout the movie.\n\nThe World Is Not Enough is only marred by some poor cringe-worthy quips that are synonyms with the franchise. It's a shame that all the hard work of writers, Bronson's and Apted's subtly was discarded in Die Another Day (2002), where it was CGI heavy and returned to a Moore- like, lighter spectacle adventure.\n\nThis Bond is in the tradition of the earlier Connery outings, the vein of Dalton's steely incarnation, and a credit must goto Pierce Brosnan as this influenced the style of the later Casino Royale rework.\n\nUltimately, The World Is Not Enough due to it's great plot is one of the better Bonds that can be enjoyed by fans and the causal viewer."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":190922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There's a specular escape in Spain, an explosion in MI6 headquarters London and a chase on the River Thames to apprehend an assassin (Sicillian star, Maria Grazia Cucinotta) that climaxes at the Millennium Dome. All this action before the James Bond title song and it's carried out not just for show, but as it's all part of the story's later developments.\n\nMichael Apted directs the 19th Bond instalment in which Brosnan gives his finest performance as 007, he appears, confident, intellectual, more dangerous and authentic as the spy. In this he is injured and carries his ailment throughout the film, making him more vulnerable and real in life threaten situations, leaving the entertaining but bland Tomorrow Never Dies behind. \n\nFor the most part this instalment is more grounded and played serious with fewer gags than in previous Bonds, certainly less than Moore's outings. A lot of this is due to Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and Bruce Feirstein screenplay which lends itself as a mystery, whodunit thriller theme and the villains, have more shades of grey as well as the heroes.\n\nDespite, Denise Richards beauty with brains role as Dr. Christmas Jones, she still appears as the typical Bond girl by the end. Robert Carlyle character Renard is given depth and ulterior motives as the villain but he still is cliché Bond Villain with scars. This aside, Sophie Marceau is excellent as femme fatale oil baron heiress Elektra King and M's (Judie Dench) late friends daughter. Dench is given more to do and shines on screen, and regulars Desmond Llewelyn (Q), Samantha Bond (Miss Moneypenny) and Colin Salmon reprise their roles. Robbie Coltrane makes a welcomed return as Zukovsky to briefly assist Bond, and Goldie makes an appearance as a henchman. Comedy legend John Cleese plays Q's side kick R. \n\nThe music score and Barry's trademark theme comes in just at the right moments to heighten the action on screen. And as a bonus the title songs music is interlaced throughout the movie.\n\nThe World Is Not Enough is only marred by some poor cringe-worthy quips that are synonyms with the franchise. It's a shame that all the hard work of writers, Bronson's and Apted's subtly was discarded in Die Another Day (2002), where it was CGI heavy and returned to a Moore- like, lighter spectacle adventure.\n\nThis Bond is in the tradition of the earlier Connery outings, the vein of Dalton's steely incarnation, and a credit must goto Pierce Brosnan as this influenced the style of the later Casino Royale rework.\n\nUltimately, The World Is Not Enough due to it's great plot is one of the better Bonds that can be enjoyed by fans and the causal viewer.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":190922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The humour that they're going for doesn't work at all I chuckled maybe once, and it was the same for my theatre.

Like Dr Who Merlin features likable characters, moments of comedy and a little bit of tension that kids and grown ups can both enjoy.\n\nThere is good chemistry between the main characters. Good sets, decent special effects and each show works well on its own and as part of a series.\n\nDon't pick too many holes in the factual details though. There are many ethnic groups in Uther's court, which probably wasn't truly representative of the population of England at that time in history. But hey, magic doesn't really exist so why not make a new TV show that has its auditions open to any actor regardless of ethnic background.\n\nI think Merlin will run for at least another series. It would be a shame if it didn't continue. Whatever the future holds for the show the excellent Colin Morgan has a bright career ahead of him.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75316,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Perhaps that is so.  But I believe being a series it can also expand on a lot of things the movie didn't have time for.\n\nA plot, characters, and humour add the entertainment factor to the StarGate, which in it's movie phase was just a concept thrown into a film.\n\nHowever being a series the writers often seem to write episodes which diverge from the main plot and end up looking like a traditional science fiction story, or an episode entirely focused on developing a character. I despise this, but many people to enjoy a break from the fate-of-the-world type hype that happens in most episodes.\n\nPersonally I think this is the greatest show to ever hit the screens, and a lot of people agree with me.  A lot of sci-fi fans love this one.  I am not a sci-fi fan, but this very concept has always been with me even before I saw the Stargate film, so I was very interested in this whole phenomenon. A lot of history buffs watch this one, as most races of people on the show are decendants from ancient Earth civilisations.  A lot of people watch it because the cast is just so sexy! (Go Amanda and Teryl!)\n\nIt really is a truly fantastic show! I recommend everyone watch it, no matter what your impression was when you first heard the title etc...","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":85425,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Szybko okazuje się, że podróż autostopem nie jest tak ekscytująca, jak się wydawało, kiedy znajduje się w środku nocy na obrzeżach postkomunistycznego miasta. Dziewczyna dostrzega na moście postać, która niebezpiecznie balansuje na barierce. Tak poznaje niezrównoważonego dziwaka Chudego. Oboje postanawiają na jakiś czas obrać taki sam kierunek podróży. Pod osłoną nocy snują się po mieście, w coraz dziwniejsze rejony, doświadczając niezwykłych emocji. Wkrótce między Młodą a Chudym tworzy się nienazwana więź. Całość oparta jest na płaszczyźnie psychodelicznej jak z narkotycznego transu.</desc>

The office they work in is reminiscent of the one in "The Apartment". Three very clever characters, great comedic acting from Parton as Doralee and Tomlin as Violet. Jane Fonda, who I never cared much for, was good as the naive Judy. Sterling Hayden has a great cameo at the end as the "Chairman of the Board". A funny revenge comedy about Every Office, U.S.A..

    <desc lang="pl">Członkowie dwupokoleniowej rodziny próbują żyć ze świadomością o jej rozpadzie. Niektórzy starają się to akceptować i trwać w takiej rzeczywistości, a inni chcą się z niej wydostać. Liczne problemy, rozpadające się związki i rozwody negatywnie wpływają na stosunki międzyludzkie. Wszystko to odbija się na dzieciach, które w ten sposób tracą szansę na normalny rozwój. Przedstawiana historia widziana jest z perspektywy małego dziecka, obserwującego zachowania swoich rodziców. Rozgrywający się dramat ojca Janusza (Grzegorz Juchiewicz) uwidacznia bezsilność w bezwiednie zapoczątkowanej autodestrukcji.</desc>

In the Introduction, the voice-over and narrator (Tilda Swinton) reflects on the often overlooked role of female directors, and that this documentary aims to correct that once and for all. We then dig in, class style almost, into 40 further chapters about any and all aspects of film making, starting with "Openings", and then on to "Tone", "Believability", "Introducing a Character", "Meet Cute", and so on, you get the idea. Each chapter is subdivided into further subchapters (typically anywhere from 4 to 6), and of course each of them chock full of movie clips. If this sounds like it's almost too good to be true, well it is true nevertheless. Finger lickin' good for movie lovers!\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest from UK writer-director Mark Cousins, whose previous work includes "The Eyes of Orson Welles", among many others. Here his ambition is ever larger than usual, and he takes on the Herculean task of documenting what women directors have accomplished over the last 100 years or so, almost encyclopedia-like. I will readily admit that I had never heard of quite a few of these women directors. To be clear: Cousins isn't just looking at the US or the UK, no, he is examining this from a global perspective! Hence plenty of attention is given to female directors from the Soviet Union, Japan, and many other countries too many to name. It absolutely blows the mind.\n\nThis documentary isn't geared towards the masses, but instead is waiting to be discovered and treasured by serious film buffs (of which I consider myself one). I happen to stumble onto this earlier this week when I was channel-surfing, and noticed this listed on Turner Classic Movies. TCM is airing this documentary in weekly episodes of about 70 min. each (typically 3 chapters per episode), with every episode including a 10 min. interview with Cousins to introduce that night's episode. New episodes air on Tuesday at 8 pm Eastern. I can't wait to see this entire series as it unfolds in the next 10 weeks or so. "Women Make Film: A New Road Movie Through Cinema" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":226,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT14H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Otherwise, it's a tricky piece of entertainment and well worth watching.\n\nISABELLE HUPPERT has a little trouble getting her lines across with her French accent being quite a handicap but she's beautiful to look at.

He's having an affair with the boss' wife and nobly tells her that he'll give details of the assailant (which she saw) to keep their affair hidden from her husband. So far, so good. The story is stylishly photographed with the appropriate menacing mood and atmosphere.\n\nBut he soon becomes the man suspected of the crime and it's from that point on that the plot contrivances become just a little too implausible, straining credibility until the very suspenseful ending. Too bad. Otherwise, it's a tricky piece of entertainment and well worth watching.\n\nISABELLE HUPPERT has a little trouble getting her lines across with her French accent being quite a handicap but she's beautiful to look at. ELIZABETH McGOVERN does a nice job as Guttenberg's partner in finding the real killer.\n\nIt moves quickly under writer/director CURTIS HANSON's direction. While many consider it "counterfeit Hitchcock", it's still worth a look.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4960,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Make no mistake, Fear Of Flying and Heavy Metal are both terrible movies but are so clichéd, cheap and poorly acted that they are hilarious to watch, and this is just as bad the others, which equals just as amusing.\n\nHaving saved the world from an anthrax bomb in Fear Of Flying, saved the world from being taken over by evil in Heavy Metal, big Craig now has the responsibility of stopping a hacker from control of the world's first automated jetliner is the! Yeah, as if! The plot itself is the source of major hilarity. The overall look of the movie has that whole Canadian B-movie feel. No stock footage is used this time around, instead we have a phony CGI plane which crashes with very cheap and unconvincing special effects.\n\nBut it's with the characters where it really gets amusing. First up is Sheffer's character, who is fired for saying he flies better when drunk. Like in Fear Of Flying, he's clearly phoning his performance and doesn't do much other than read his lines. It really makes me wonder why he decided to take the lead in four extremely similar B-movies. John Piper Ferguson appears to be in a different film, and appears to be enjoying every minute of his ridiculous character, which is a stereotypical "computer geek". He's dressed in drab clothes and sporting greasy hair and glasses, and his best friend is a rare Australian spider! The writers also seem confused as to whether this character is an evil psychopathic menace, or a pathetic character who we're supposed be sympathetic to. He befriends a little girl who lives in the same block, which appears to be an attempt to humanise the character. The way he handles the character itself is pretty hilarious. Not for one second taking it seriously, he jumps around the room and hams it up to the max. His character is great fun to watch but not exactly in the way I believe the filmmakers intended it to be. He's clearly just poking fun at the ridiculous character and seems bemused to have this on his CV. \n\nThe movie itself is also incredibly poorly pieced together. It feels like they made it as they went on, culminating in an ending so ridiculous that I can't even begin to describe it. I won't spoil it for you but I laughed a LOT when I saw what finally lead them to the "hacker". It involves the pet spider and an extremely lucky coincidental turn of events.\n\nOverall, this is rubbish and only one member of the cast seems to be aware of that, but it's at least funny rubbish.

But when a movie is a very good play, we should be happy as well because there just aren't that many good things around.\n\nThis is a play, there's no mistaking. All the dynamics in it are seated in the words, all the motives in the four beings. There is no cinematic device used or necessary, except the revealing of the passport at the end, and I am sure that was handled differently in the stage version.\n\nMike Nichols makes a living out of taking constructions that work well on the stage and adding a few cinematic glosses so that the thing gives the impression it was born as a screen being. I find his tricks in this regard distracting, even a bit offensive because he hasn't adapted as the visual vocabulary has. \n\nNever mind. Just eliminate the film components of its being and focus on the stage components and you still have something worthwhile, because here Nichols is still fresh.\n\nYou can read other folks to learn the story. It hardly matters. What matters to me is the clever, deep way the writer has constructed the thing. The visceral effect is from the panic and desperation of love. Nothing new there. What makes this effective, I think, are two things. Writerly things.\n\nThe first is that he hasn't just described the tippy balance of living in a romance. He hasn't just displayed the radical fuzziness and unpredictability of a world where that is all you know. He's made it the root of the story. This story has absolutely none of the logic to it that you expect when you see a love story. Everything seems real and natural after it has happened, but there's no way at all to predict what will happen next when you are in the thing. Its a great help in storytelling; you have to cling fast to what is happening. Its the best type of engagement, sucking you in by simply making you wonder, even worry about what is going to happen next. Its rare. Its good.\n\nI'd like to point out how the four characters are constructed. A popular writing technique is to take one whole soul and break it into bits. Then the bits can get fleshed out imperfectly and interact so that the interaction has a being. In this case, start with a movie. What four pieces do you need? The writer (Dan), the photographer (Anna), the actor (Alice) and the director, the person concerned with the "skin" of the thing.\n\nIts no accident, I think that it is impossible to settle on any one of these characters. You can go through this experience time and time again, each time tracing a different person's path, or the path of a relationship or even an urge.\n\nThis part is great too. Apart from Nichols' cinematic naivety, there's only one blot: Julia Roberts. She just doesn't understand what it means to be part of an assembly. She's not an actress in the real sense, the theatrical sense that Nichols knows how to sculpt.

Twins at the same time so different yet so similar and bound by a strong and extremely credible and deep brotherly love, similar also in the kind of life, an unsatisfactory, melancholy life where something is missing enough to bring both to attempt suicide just like their father had done before them to look for an escape from the disappointments and injustices of life. A relationship that has suffered from a distance that lasted more than ten years but perhaps it is the only thing that can complete their life and that can make them move forward together. One of the biggest surprises of the film is precisely the interpretations of the two protagonists, Kristen Wiig who proves to be unexpectedly talented even in dramatic roles and an extraordinary Bill Hader that represents the soul of the film thanks to its performance in perfect harmony with its charismatic and complexed character. What is missing from the film is a more incisive personality and a better beat and amalgamated rhythm that would have helped especially to make it more engaging and less heavy, in any case manages to convey a variety of emotions thanks to many scenes that I will hardly forget because of their really strong emotional impact.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40784,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Twins at the same time so different yet so similar and bound by a strong and extremely credible and deep brotherly love, similar also in the kind of life, an unsatisfactory, melancholy life where something is missing enough to bring both to attempt suicide just like their father had done before them to look for an escape from the disappointments and injustices of life. A relationship that has suffered from a distance that lasted more than ten years but perhaps it is the only thing that can complete their life and that can make them move forward together. One of the biggest surprises of the film is precisely the interpretations of the two protagonists, Kristen Wiig who proves to be unexpectedly talented even in dramatic roles and an extraordinary Bill Hader that represents the soul of the film thanks to its performance in perfect harmony with its charismatic and complexed character. What is missing from the film is a more incisive personality and a better beat and amalgamated rhythm that would have helped especially to make it more engaging and less heavy, in any case manages to convey a variety of emotions thanks to many scenes that I will hardly forget because of their really strong emotional impact.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40784,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'd actually call it THE new break-out series to watch for 2016. It's nice to know there are still true Creatives working in the industry who can produce a gripping, interesting program without the benefit of a huge budget or glossing every other scene over in tons of fancy CGI. \n\nI wouldn't mind just a bit more in the special effects arena, but there is a Realness to the plot/episodes that manages to transcend the lack of technical effects, which let's the viewer's imagination do some of the best work. That may be the singular quality that makes it so phenomenal to watch! I also think that as this sci-fi series grows its following, Travelers could be a lot like other Cult Favorites that were lower budget but grew up --just enough-- to start incorporating a few more well-placed, topically-consistent special effects (think Lost Girl, Fringe, DW, Orphan Black, etc).\n\nThe plot is well-premised, based on a peek at a frightening future that is almost too easy for viewers to conjure up on their own. Travelers may be firmly anchored in Here and Now, but the Future and Past are folded into the Present with excellent story lines and smooth, logical character development. This yields amazingly restrained but thoughtful performances from the actors, including the ever-talented Eric McCormack (in, what may very well be, the best role of his career). The episodes are so subtle yet intense that each one will grab you by the brain and you won't want to stop watching. I've re-watched the pilot episode a few times now, and it still hasn't gotten old. Like a very good book, each new pass yields a little more for the imagination to chew on. \n\nI highly recommend this gem of a show and truly hope Travelers gets picked up for a long, healthy run. Fingers crossed!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48258,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
