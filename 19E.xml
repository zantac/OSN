This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started.

Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16201,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135585/","name":"Freddy Rodríguez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the "Most Wanted" episode. That episode was the Pilot for "FBI: Most Wanted" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there. Now give them the surrounding plots and characters that made S1 so good CBS. Put S1 on All Access too while you're at it!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12189,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16201,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135585/","name":"Freddy Rodríguez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next.

If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the "Most Wanted" episode. That episode was the Pilot for "FBI: Most Wanted" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there.

Would it trigger me into drinking? Would it portray drinking in a positive light? Obviously I threw my doubts aside and watched it and I am glad I did. This film primarily tells the tale of Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) who is going through the motions of life. He is no longer effective as a teacher and his family life is lacking due to the alienation of his wife and kids. However, on a boozy night out with a group of co-workers / friends an idea is formed, based on Norwegian philosopher and psychologist Finn Skårderud's theory that humans are born with a blood alcohol level 0.050 lower than it should be, and that that amount should be drunk every day in order to bring about optimum performance levels. As all four friends engage in drinking in the morning things appear to work well, until the inevitable escalation. First off, this film is genuinely funny. Secondly, it is moving. Third, it is beautiful to look at. However if I were to judge this film as person who has a troubling relationship with alcohol and try to pinpoint a message to the film, then I would have some trouble. I believe the film is a commentary on the absurdity of Danish drinking culture. Not being Danish I maybe can't fully comprehend the social intricacies, but being British I can certainly understand (drinking is our culture).

Would it trigger me into drinking? Would it portray drinking in a positive light? Obviously I threw my doubts aside and watched it and I am glad I did. This film primarily tells the tale of Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) who is going through the motions of life. He is no longer effective as a teacher and his family life is lacking due to the alienation of his wife and kids. However, on a boozy night out with a group of co-workers / friends an idea is formed, based on Norwegian philosopher and psychologist Finn Skårderud's theory that humans are born with a blood alcohol level 0.050 lower than it should be, and that that amount should be drunk every day in order to bring about optimum performance levels. As all four friends engage in drinking in the morning things appear to work well, until the inevitable escalation. First off, this film is genuinely funny. Secondly, it is moving. Third, it is beautiful to look at. However if I were to judge this film as person who has a troubling relationship with alcohol and try to pinpoint a message to the film, then I would have some trouble. I believe the film is a commentary on the absurdity of Danish drinking culture. Not being Danish I maybe can't fully comprehend the social intricacies, but being British I can certainly understand (drinking is our culture). For better or worse this film doesn't appear to state definitively whether drinking alcohol is good or bad. Certainly you view tragedy born from over imbibing, but then it shows that there are some positives. For someone like me who wishes to moderate but can't and wants a binary judgement, this rubs me the wrong way.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106998,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-24","keywords":"heavy drinking,drinking,teacher,high school,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4070162713","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ4NGY3ZWEtMWYyMy00MzY4LWFlNzktYjdmMGFjYTIxNGJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ4NGY3ZWEtMWYyMy00MzY4LWFlNzktYjdmMGFjYTIxNGJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four friends, all high school teachers, test a theory that they will improve their lives by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in their blood.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586568/","name":"Mads Mikkelsen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488917/","name":"Thomas Bo Larsen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2099237/","name":"Magnus Millang"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0899121/","name":"Thomas Vinterberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136662/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001935/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0338571/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0899121/","name":"Thomas Vinterberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2105585/","name":"Tobias Lindholm"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That's the point!","reviewBody":"Reading the message boards and some of the reviews for this film, I was amused (and I confess, a bit surprised) at how few viewers seemed to grasp the point. This is the sort of film that you have to think about while watching; it requires something on the part of the viewer. It's not meant to be passive entertainment. Yes, Tatou's character is annoying. Yes, Baer's character is irritating. But that's the whole idea. Tatou's "Michele" is a shallow, superficial fashion model in search of a "great cause" to identify with. (Of course, we know that no top model was ever like that, don't we!) Her constant reading of self-help books and what I like to call "bathtub philosophy" (like bathtub gin, it is home made and of dubious quality) leads her on a "spiritual quest" in the modern sense of the buzzword that spirituality has become--the search for a feel-good factor that will make her feel better about herself, her decisions and her life. Baer's "François" considers himself to be above all need for religion, heritage, even his own history. He's too intellectual (in his own eyes) to need any of those "crutches". And yet he is drawn into a relationship with the dysfunctional, needy Michele because neither one is happy with themselves and both hope to find someone to fill the gaping hole in their lives.\n\nI have known many people of this type personally...they wander from one idea, one philosophy, one country, career or "lifestyle" to another without ever really committing to anything. That's why it says "To be continued" at the end of the film: these people will search forever, without ever seeing what's right in front of their noses. Their personal movie will go on...and on...and on. When the lights come up at the end of the show of their lives, Death will take them totally by surprise.\n\nAt first, I found the choppy editing annoying and confusing; it looks like a poorly made end-of-term project for film school. But that also helps make a point. Real life doesn't follow a nice, smooth script, and you can't edit the final rushes to suit yourself. It is what it is, with all its mistakes, out-takes, missed cues and forgotten lines. This is one of those minor films that can grow on you with time, if you learn to see beyond the surface into the ideas behind the emotions. It's only "shallow" if you fixate on the reflections...the water underneath is deep, and full of surprises. No, it's not Oscar material. It will never have mass appeal.

Danish production, shot in South Africa, it looked convincingly American west. It's very old school in its story, good guy vs bad guy, revenge, gun fights, the whole nine yards. And it's a pretty fine movie too.\n\nDanish guy waits for his wife and son to arrive in America to start new lives, but bad guys are going to spoil their plan. There's no way he's going to let them bad guys go, after toiling for 7 years to start a new life only to see it destroyed as soon as his family arrives. And did I mention he fought wars in the Danish army before he moved to America? Oh yeah, this Dane know how to shoot straight too.\n\nYou really do get the feeling that this guy wants no trouble and just wants to get on with his life, but it's trouble that comes looking for him.

Danish production, shot in South Africa, it looked convincingly American west. It's very old school in its story, good guy vs bad guy, revenge, gun fights, the whole nine yards. And it's a pretty fine movie too.\n\nDanish guy waits for his wife and son to arrive in America to start new lives, but bad guys are going to spoil their plan. There's no way he's going to let them bad guys go, after toiling for 7 years to start a new life only to see it destroyed as soon as his family arrives. And did I mention he fought wars in the Danish army before he moved to America? Oh yeah, this Dane know how to shoot straight too.\n\nYou really do get the feeling that this guy wants no trouble and just wants to get on with his life, but it's trouble that comes looking for him.

I recommend to ignore watching seasons 4-5 because the writing, and acting changed for the negative. The two main characters in Billions were prominent in seasons 1-3, while in seasons 4-5 these two main characters seemed to be placed in the background. The show is definitely worth watching for the first three seasons while after these three seasons it seems to go into a different and sadly disappointing viewing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75514,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-01-01","keywords":"u.s. attorney,hedge fund,white collar crime,rivalry,profanity","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0316079/","name":"Paul Giamatti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0507073/","name":"Damian Lewis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1745019/","name":"Maggie Siff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048667/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0695646/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002718/","name":"Brian Koppelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505522/","name":"David Levien","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3376444/","name":"Andrew Ross Sorkin"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 5 Part 2 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi996196377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRlNWYxNjMtZTYwZC00OWY1LTkwMjktN2ZiZGRkYTc0NTY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRlNWYxNjMtZTYwZC00OWY1LTkwMjktN2ZiZGRkYTc0NTY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Bobby Axelrod and Chuck Rhodes have been unscrupulous adversaries and underhanded allies, but nothing has prepared them for the ruthless machinations of billionaire Mike Prince, who'll use everything -- and everyone -- at his disposal to come out on top.

It is well written and the cinematography and sets really take you back to what it could have been in Berlin 1920s. The poverty, life, rich, poor, politics, morality, ethics and corruption are all part of the story. I have the benefit of being able to watch this with English subtitles or I would have missed the opportunity to really enjoy this show. Unfortunately, whom ever translated it, their English is not the first language and at times the sentences are backwards in English which is normally when someone is translating verbatim but I get the gist of it.

The poverty, life, rich, poor, politics, morality, ethics and corruption are all part of the story. I have the benefit of being able to watch this with English subtitles or I would have missed the opportunity to really enjoy this show. Unfortunately, whom ever translated it, their English is not the first language and at times the sentences are backwards in English which is normally when someone is translating verbatim but I get the gist of it. If you like time pieces and or like shows such as Endeavor, George Gently, Trapped, Modus and similar then you are likely to enjoy this program.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21197,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-10-13","keywords":"berlin germany,1920s,police,weimar republic,interwar period","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1432815/","name":"Volker Bruch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2939186/","name":"Liv Lisa Fries","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2914059/","name":"Leonie Benesch"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061958/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044017/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359634/","name":"Henk Handloegten","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0902022/","name":"Achim von Borries"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer Season 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2628238873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3YWI2YzctZjNmYS00OGRhLTk3MzgtNDA2ZWU3ZmVjODA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmQ3YWI2YzctZjNmYS00OGRhLTk3MzgtNDA2ZWU3ZmVjODA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sure, I winced when Freda Black went on and on about the porn, as if its existence on Peterson's computer in and of itself indicates anything.

In the 1800s, two elderly maiden ladies (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in remote Jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities, and personal happiness in order to continue their long-dead father's religious ministry to the small flock he served. One of the women's youthful admirers sends to them a Frenchwoman, Babette (Stéphane Audran), whose husband and son have been killed in France and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate. Although they do not really require her services, the sisters engage her as maid and cook--and as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined; indeed, the entire village admires and depends upon her.\n\nOne day, however, Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now, by village standards, a wealthy woman. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France, the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation. The meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember--but not for reasons that might be expected, for Babette's feast proves to be food for both body and soul, and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her.\n\nThe film is extraordinary in every way, meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them. As the film progresses, we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to God and their all-too-human frailties, and the scenes in which Babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful, and incredibly memorable. There have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love, but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of BABETTE'S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul. Highly, highly recommended.\n\nGary F.

I am not an intellectual, so my review will be brief. At its most basic, "8 1/2" (a.k.a. "Otto e mezzo") concerns Guido, a film director (supposedly a surrogate for Fellini himself), who is having what amounts to a midlife crisis. Guido is frustrated in his film-making, and by his relations with other people in his life. But the film's story does not proceed in a traditional, linear fashion. Fellini more or less abandons logical narration, in favor of "open form" narration, wherein the story's causal chain of events is broken.\n\nThus, trying to figure out what is going on in this film can be hard. Guido's fantasies, memories, dreams, and reality co-mingle in a kind of cinematic stew. Fellini presents viewers with a kaleidoscope of surreal B&amp;W images of ordinary objects and eccentric, chattering characters which interact with Guido and with each other, in ways that defy logic, and give breathtaking meaning to the term symbolism. Followers of psychologist Carl Jung would have a field day. In style, the film is flamboyant. In substance, the film is maddeningly subliminal. And yet, even the most metallic cynic, Pauline Kael notwithstanding, must surely appreciate the rareness of Fellini's probing introspection.\n\nGiven the bizarre, unstructured content of "8 1/2", I wonder about the issue of necessity. Suppose Fellini had added an extra ten minutes to the screenplay, or deleted ten minutes. Would that have made any difference? Apart from Guido, if this or that character had been deleted, how would that have changed the story's significance? And if, as some have suggested, the film is a mirror image of Fellini's own confused psyche, can the story be construed as an intuition of his future film-making?\n\n"Otto e mezzo" is not for everyone.

I am not an intellectual, so my review will be brief. At its most basic, "8 1/2" (a.k.a. "Otto e mezzo") concerns Guido, a film director (supposedly a surrogate for Fellini himself), who is having what amounts to a midlife crisis. Guido is frustrated in his film-making, and by his relations with other people in his life. But the film's story does not proceed in a traditional, linear fashion. Fellini more or less abandons logical narration, in favor of "open form" narration, wherein the story's causal chain of events is broken.\n\nThus, trying to figure out what is going on in this film can be hard. Guido's fantasies, memories, dreams, and reality co-mingle in a kind of cinematic stew. Fellini presents viewers with a kaleidoscope of surreal B&amp;W images of ordinary objects and eccentric, chattering characters which interact with Guido and with each other, in ways that defy logic, and give breathtaking meaning to the term symbolism. Followers of psychologist Carl Jung would have a field day. In style, the film is flamboyant. In substance, the film is maddeningly subliminal. And yet, even the most metallic cynic, Pauline Kael notwithstanding, must surely appreciate the rareness of Fellini's probing introspection.\n\nGiven the bizarre, unstructured content of "8 1/2", I wonder about the issue of necessity. Suppose Fellini had added an extra ten minutes to the screenplay, or deleted ten minutes. Would that have made any difference? Apart from Guido, if this or that character had been deleted, how would that have changed the story's significance? And if, as some have suggested, the film is a mirror image of Fellini's own confused psyche, can the story be construed as an intuition of his future film-making?\n\n"Otto e mezzo" is not for everyone. Like a Zen koan, "8 1/2" invites frustration. It is above all else a celebration of ambiguity and abstraction, a cinematic experience to ponder, especially on the heels of four or five martinis ... or 8 1/2, if you really want to induce immense intellectual insight.

The film concerns young Peggy Heller (excellently portrayed by Judy Geeson), who, after suffering a nervous breakdown, moves with her new teacher husband to a large, private boys' school on 1,200 acres of English countryside. Poor Peggy is soon made the victim of a string of attacks by a stalker with a prosthetic hand, and her lot is hardly made more comfortable by the presence of the very strange headmaster (Peter Cushing) or his haughty young wife (Joan Collins). The film builds to a surprise ending of sorts that probably won't surprise many, especially those viewers who have already seen a certain classic Vincent Price horror movie from 1958. Still, the film does offer some compensations, including very fine performances by the actors just mentioned, as well as by Ralph Bates, playing Peggy's husband. Viewers will appreciate just how fine the acting is, perhaps, after a second viewing, with a greater knowledge of all the characters' secret motivations. The film also offers some beautiful scenery, both in terms of the autumnal Hertfordshire countryside AND Ms. Collins herself. Thirty-nine years old here, and nine years prior to incarnating TV's ultimate bitch on wheels, Alexis Carrington Colby Dexter, etc. on "Dynasty," she really is quite gorgeous to look at.

The film concerns young Peggy Heller (excellently portrayed by Judy Geeson), who, after suffering a nervous breakdown, moves with her new teacher husband to a large, private boys' school on 1,200 acres of English countryside. Poor Peggy is soon made the victim of a string of attacks by a stalker with a prosthetic hand, and her lot is hardly made more comfortable by the presence of the very strange headmaster (Peter Cushing) or his haughty young wife (Joan Collins). The film builds to a surprise ending of sorts that probably won't surprise many, especially those viewers who have already seen a certain classic Vincent Price horror movie from 1958. Still, the film does offer some compensations, including very fine performances by the actors just mentioned, as well as by Ralph Bates, playing Peggy's husband. Viewers will appreciate just how fine the acting is, perhaps, after a second viewing, with a greater knowledge of all the characters' secret motivations. The film also offers some beautiful scenery, both in terms of the autumnal Hertfordshire countryside AND Ms. Collins herself. Thirty-nine years old here, and nine years prior to incarnating TV's ultimate bitch on wheels, Alexis Carrington Colby Dexter, etc. on "Dynasty," she really is quite gorgeous to look at. (Sadly, she and Cushing, though playing man and wife, share no screen time whatsoever in this picture.) But the film belongs to Geeson, who appears in every single scene (with one major exception). Just five years after her "To Sir, With Love" debut, she turns in a very credible and ingratiating performance.

I suppose anyone brought up on fin de siecle Hollywood would interpret that as `slow and boring'. But this was Hollywood tackling an intellectual piece with, well, intellect. I must confess that the thought of a 1945 Hollywood attempt at Oscar Wilde did not appeal. Memories of one or two previous efforts at English literary classics set alarm bells ringing.

And this, in a sense, detracts from the depths to which Gray descends in order to be forever youthful and live life with scant regard for others. And in many years of watching BBC Victorian costume dramas I don't recall seeing such outfits on the backs of London's society ladies! However some of the other detail is first class. In particular Sir Thomas's decision to remain at table (`never could resist Aunt Agatha's quails') in spite of Lord Henry's outrageous comments rings true through to today. As the script had it `think like a Liberal, eat like a Tory'.\n\n The acting is excellent with Hurd Hatfield's portrayal quite remarkable in that he wears the same expression virtually throughout, in order, no doubt, to conceal his true emotions. George Sanders, as Lord Henry, steals every scene he's in thanks to a rapid delivery of Wilde's witticisms that would have Groucho Marx and Woody Allen in awe. Angela Lansbury is, perhaps, a little too demure for a theatrical singer from the East End but, no doubt, this was a result of director's orders.\n\nEssential viewing for anyone interested in the history of film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12538,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1945-03-03","keywords":"painting,painter,soul,hedonist,deal with the devil","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2741026585","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001695/","name":"George Sanders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0368836/","name":"Hurd Hatfield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001656/","name":"Donna Reed"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0928492/","name":"Oscar Wilde"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As the script had it `think like a Liberal, eat like a Tory'.\n\n The acting is excellent with Hurd Hatfield's portrayal quite remarkable in that he wears the same expression virtually throughout, in order, no doubt, to conceal his true emotions. George Sanders, as Lord Henry, steals every scene he's in thanks to a rapid delivery of Wilde's witticisms that would have Groucho Marx and Woody Allen in awe. Angela Lansbury is, perhaps, a little too demure for a theatrical singer from the East End but, no doubt, this was a result of director's orders.\n\nEssential viewing for anyone interested in the history of film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12538,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1945-03-03","keywords":"painting,painter,soul,hedonist,deal with the devil","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2741026585","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001695/","name":"George Sanders","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0368836/","name":"Hurd Hatfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001656/","name":"Donna Reed"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0928492/","name":"Oscar Wilde"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The story is all about Lady Hamilton and her unhappy marriage, her love for Nelson, and the consequences of leaving her stodgy husband to live adulterously and with the man she loved.  (He was already famous before Trafalger, this was the "Monicagate" of its day)  It's a fine soap opera, centered around a performance that can only be called luminous.\n\nThe camera doesn't just love Leigh, it gets down on its knees and worships her.  Even in GWTW she never looked so unbelievably beautiful, and she's also completely charming and sensitive.  The great Sir Laurence Olivier doesn't have a chance, he barely registers.  He's handicapped by a serious lack of screen time and a dreadful red pony-tail wig, but the director seems to have decided to give him short shrift so he can squeeze in a few more exquisite close-ups of Leigh being enchanting.

The story is all about Lady Hamilton and her unhappy marriage, her love for Nelson, and the consequences of leaving her stodgy husband to live adulterously and with the man she loved.  (He was already famous before Trafalger, this was the "Monicagate" of its day)  It's a fine soap opera, centered around a performance that can only be called luminous.\n\nThe camera doesn't just love Leigh, it gets down on its knees and worships her.  Even in GWTW she never looked so unbelievably beautiful, and she's also completely charming and sensitive.  The great Sir Laurence Olivier doesn't have a chance, he barely registers.  He's handicapped by a serious lack of screen time and a dreadful red pony-tail wig, but the director seems to have decided to give him short shrift so he can squeeze in a few more exquisite close-ups of Leigh being enchanting.  And she is, oh is she ever...","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4310,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"1941-04-30","keywords":"reference to voltaire,husband and wife co star,courtesan,period drama,reference to marie antoinette","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3419717657","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ3MTc3MTYtNDE3MC00M2Q3LWI4ZWEtMWIxMTdkYTg0YWIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ3MTc3MTYtNDE3MC00M2Q3LWI4ZWEtMWIxMTdkYTg0YWIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000046/","name":"Vivien Leigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000059/","name":"Laurence Olivier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0610253/","name":"Alan Mowbray"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0466099/","name":"Alexander Korda"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0145685/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281556/","name":"Walter Reisch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0792670/","name":"R.C.

She carried 8 15-inch guns and a powerful secondary battery and could make 30 knots.  It wasn't one of the biggest or most powerful battleships ever built.  The Japanese had the Yamato and Mushashi towards the end of the war, juggernauts with 18-inch cannons.  There's a limit to gigantism of course, and in the case of battleships it had to do with whether they could fit physically through the Panama Canal, a concern the Japanese had long put behind them.  So the Bismark wasn't the sort of sacred monster that sheer size would make her.  But she LOOKED absolutely great.  Sleek, well balanced, with her superstructure done the way an architect might have done it, not an engineer.  She looked built for speed, and endurance too.  For an example of the opposite trend, take a look at Rodney or Nelson.  More powerfully armed, with 9 16-inch guns carried in three turrets, all set forward of the superstructure.  Man, that is one ugly design.  And, more than that, Bismarck's crew were highly trained and she was equipped with one of the world's best optical fire-control systems.  It wasn't just luck that sank the Hood and damaged any smaller ships that go too close; it was good shooting.  (Her shooting didn't fall off until that final bombardment.) Winston Churchill called her "a masterpiece of naval construction," although not in this movie.  She kept large elements of the fleet pinned down at home simply by sitting in her protected port and being available.\n\nI must have seen this movie a dozen times and each time I begin by wondering if I'll be able to sit through it again.  (I've got some of the exchanges memorized.)  I generally make it, though.  It's too good in its own dated way to pass up.  \n\nThe model work is not bad at all for its time.  The reviewer who said this film called for black and white was correct.  It looks cold and frightening on the North Atlantic.  Almost everything would have been, or at least seemed, gray even if it had been shot in color.  The peformances are up to professional standards.  More is a different character here from his usual jocular one -- frosty, demanding, and no nonsense.  Until finally, overcome with emotion, he breaks down in an understated scene.  Dana Wynter, his assistant, spots him and discreetly leaves him alone.  She's too beautiful to criticize as an actress.  She radiates purity and anima and gently draws More out of his shell.  Naismith is a familiar face, as are many of the others.  And there is a running gag in this underground bunker where More is plotting the Bismarck's demise.  Nobody knows what time it is or, if they know it's 9 o'clock, they don't know if its morning or evening.  Even the Germans aboard the Bismarck are lent some humanity by the script writers. The cadets look like earnest fresh-faced kids.  The Captain is a practical man, worried about his ship and his crew.  Only Karel Stepanek, as Lutjens, belongs in another, much earlier movie, say one made in 1943.  He is well out of the frame established in the rest of the film.  Stricken with awe when he gets a birthday greeting from You-Know-Who.  Some of the dialogue is made up, out of necessity.  Who knows what went on on the Bismarck's bridge, especially during that last catastrophic shelling?  Back in the bunker, Dana Wynter looks down at the wooden models on her chart where a dozen British warships surround the single Bismarck and pound her to pieces.  "I don't feel like cheering," she says.  Well, "War is all hell."  Maybe that's why human beings seem to need another one every twenty years or so, to remind ourselves.  \n\nWhat a waste of great ships, and of good men, on both sides.

She carried 8 15-inch guns and a powerful secondary battery and could make 30 knots.  It wasn't one of the biggest or most powerful battleships ever built.  The Japanese had the Yamato and Mushashi towards the end of the war, juggernauts with 18-inch cannons.  There's a limit to gigantism of course, and in the case of battleships it had to do with whether they could fit physically through the Panama Canal, a concern the Japanese had long put behind them.  So the Bismark wasn't the sort of sacred monster that sheer size would make her.  But she LOOKED absolutely great.  Sleek, well balanced, with her superstructure done the way an architect might have done it, not an engineer.  She looked built for speed, and endurance too.  For an example of the opposite trend, take a look at Rodney or Nelson.  More powerfully armed, with 9 16-inch guns carried in three turrets, all set forward of the superstructure.  Man, that is one ugly design.  And, more than that, Bismarck's crew were highly trained and she was equipped with one of the world's best optical fire-control systems.  It wasn't just luck that sank the Hood and damaged any smaller ships that go too close; it was good shooting.  (Her shooting didn't fall off until that final bombardment.) Winston Churchill called her "a masterpiece of naval construction," although not in this movie.  She kept large elements of the fleet pinned down at home simply by sitting in her protected port and being available.\n\nI must have seen this movie a dozen times and each time I begin by wondering if I'll be able to sit through it again.  (I've got some of the exchanges memorized.)  I generally make it, though.  It's too good in its own dated way to pass up.  \n\nThe model work is not bad at all for its time.  The reviewer who said this film called for black and white was correct.  It looks cold and frightening on the North Atlantic.  Almost everything would have been, or at least seemed, gray even if it had been shot in color.  The peformances are up to professional standards.  More is a different character here from his usual jocular one -- frosty, demanding, and no nonsense.  Until finally, overcome with emotion, he breaks down in an understated scene.  Dana Wynter, his assistant, spots him and discreetly leaves him alone.  She's too beautiful to criticize as an actress.  She radiates purity and anima and gently draws More out of his shell.  Naismith is a familiar face, as are many of the others.  And there is a running gag in this underground bunker where More is plotting the Bismarck's demise.  Nobody knows what time it is or, if they know it's 9 o'clock, they don't know if its morning or evening.  Even the Germans aboard the Bismarck are lent some humanity by the script writers. The cadets look like earnest fresh-faced kids.  The Captain is a practical man, worried about his ship and his crew.  Only Karel Stepanek, as Lutjens, belongs in another, much earlier movie, say one made in 1943.  He is well out of the frame established in the rest of the film.  Stricken with awe when he gets a birthday greeting from You-Know-Who.  Some of the dialogue is made up, out of necessity.  Who knows what went on on the Bismarck's bridge, especially during that last catastrophic shelling?  Back in the bunker, Dana Wynter looks down at the wooden models on her chart where a dozen British warships surround the single Bismarck and pound her to pieces.  "I don't feel like cheering," she says.  Well, "War is all hell."  Maybe that's why human beings seem to need another one every twenty years or so, to remind ourselves.  \n\nWhat a waste of great ships, and of good men, on both sides.  And an argument could even be made that Bismarck's sister ship, the Tirpitz, played an even more important part in the war simply by staying put and tying down so many British ships that were needed elsewhere.  Our side "wins," of course.  Our side almost always wins when we're the side that's funding the movie.  A lot of viewers will expectably feel relief when the threat represented by Bismarck is over, but they probably won't feel much like cheering.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7226,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1960-02-11","keywords":"war at sea,dying young,mass death,naval,north atlantic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sink The Bismarck!","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1067255321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY1Y2UxZGQtZjZhOS00MWU0LWIyNTctYzA0NmQ0ODlmOTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGY1Y2UxZGQtZjZhOS00MWU0LWIyNTctYzA0NmQ0ODlmOTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this historical film","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0603336/","name":"Kenneth More","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0944073/","name":"Dana Wynter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0617846/","name":"Carl Möhner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0318150/","name":"Lewis Gilbert"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0636002/","name":"Edmund H.

"Accattone" is the directorial debut of the Italian neo-realist, Pier Paolo Pasolini, but by a strange coincidence it ended up being the very last of all his movies that I saw. I had seen everything he ever did, including short films by the time I got to "Accatone" and still found it masterful. \n\nFranco Citti stars as the title character, he is a handsome pimp in Rome's post-war lower depths, with an endearing face that speaks volumes of his street-wise upbringing in the slums. To those unaccustomed with Southern Italian culture the way he spends his days with the other local pimps, playing cards and being lazy may seem vile, but it is actually a well grounded tradition, as is also his support of the entire family of his imprisoned friend, Ciccio, who depend on him for survival. He is obviously a fellow mobster, and their code of honor is at stake when Accatone discovers that he is in prison as a result of his whore, Maddalena, played by Silvana Corsini, who denounced Ciccio to the authorities. Even though she is recovering from a broken leg, Accatone forces her to go on the streets, where she is used, beaten and abandoned by Accatone's pals after he tells them the story, then she is found by the police and arrested. Accattone nearly starves to death from the total lack of income, he even sells all his jewelry to get by. He tries to reunite with his wife, with whom he has fathered at least one child, but she sees through his seduction act and her virile, beautiful brother beats up Accatone in an intense erotically-charged scene that seems to simulate sexual assault as much as violence between the men. \n\nAfter meeting the innocent and beautiful Stella, (Franca Pasut) he is smitten and tries to get a job, so he can support her and his family but he is not accustomed to hardship and has the lack of patience that is typical of spoilt types that have never been trained to work does not make the job last for very long. \n\nNever have I seen a more humane, direct and simple depiction of the tragic life of these undesirables of society. Pasolini is a master painter narrating with a few gestures all their hardship and suffering. Even getting a plate of food in this world is a memorable accomplishment. We see the whole setting as a sideline of modern society's inability to function properly. The 'corrections' by the police seem to be the most unjust of all, and Pasolini presents this panorama of human failing as an allegory of human struggle and spiritual redemption.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8129,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1961-11-22","keywords":"deception,italy,1950s,ethical dilemma,moral dilemma","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0162948/","name":"Franco Citti"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0665186/","name":"Franca Pasut"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0181122/","name":"Silvana Corsini"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001596/","name":"Pier Paolo Pasolini"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029259/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055606/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001596/","name":"Pier Paolo Pasolini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0162952/","name":"Sergio Citti"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"Accattone" is the directorial debut of the Italian neo-realist, Pier Paolo Pasolini, but by a strange coincidence it ended up being the very last of all his movies that I saw. I had seen everything he ever did, including short films by the time I got to "Accatone" and still found it masterful. \n\nFranco Citti stars as the title character, he is a handsome pimp in Rome's post-war lower depths, with an endearing face that speaks volumes of his street-wise upbringing in the slums. To those unaccustomed with Southern Italian culture the way he spends his days with the other local pimps, playing cards and being lazy may seem vile, but it is actually a well grounded tradition, as is also his support of the entire family of his imprisoned friend, Ciccio, who depend on him for survival. He is obviously a fellow mobster, and their code of honor is at stake when Accatone discovers that he is in prison as a result of his whore, Maddalena, played by Silvana Corsini, who denounced Ciccio to the authorities. Even though she is recovering from a broken leg, Accatone forces her to go on the streets, where she is used, beaten and abandoned by Accatone's pals after he tells them the story, then she is found by the police and arrested. Accattone nearly starves to death from the total lack of income, he even sells all his jewelry to get by. He tries to reunite with his wife, with whom he has fathered at least one child, but she sees through his seduction act and her virile, beautiful brother beats up Accatone in an intense erotically-charged scene that seems to simulate sexual assault as much as violence between the men. \n\nAfter meeting the innocent and beautiful Stella, (Franca Pasut) he is smitten and tries to get a job, so he can support her and his family but he is not accustomed to hardship and has the lack of patience that is typical of spoilt types that have never been trained to work does not make the job last for very long. \n\nNever have I seen a more humane, direct and simple depiction of the tragic life of these undesirables of society. Pasolini is a master painter narrating with a few gestures all their hardship and suffering. Even getting a plate of food in this world is a memorable accomplishment. We see the whole setting as a sideline of modern society's inability to function properly. The 'corrections' by the police seem to be the most unjust of all, and Pasolini presents this panorama of human failing as an allegory of human struggle and spiritual redemption.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8129,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1961-11-22","keywords":"deception,italy,1950s,ethical dilemma,moral dilemma","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0162948/","name":"Franco Citti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0665186/","name":"Franca Pasut","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0181122/","name":"Silvana Corsini"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001596/","name":"Pier Paolo Pasolini"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029259/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055606/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001596/","name":"Pier Paolo Pasolini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0162952/","name":"Sergio Citti"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's a great part for Douglas with his incredible charm and quick burn when someone does him wrong.\n\nThe Big Sky was RKO Pictures big production for 1952. I'd like to say that Howard Hughes spared no expense in making this film, shooting a good deal of it in the Grand Tetons, the actual location for the adventures of many fur trappers. But for the life of me I don't understand why Hughes and RKO after doing that, didn't spring for color.\n\nPossibly because director Howard Hawks wanted black and white. His last epic film Red River had done well in black and white. Still I really think something was missed. RKO did use color on films with a lot less budget.\n\nThere's a lot of similarity between The Big Sky and Red River. Both films involve a group of men on an epic journey into the unknown for business reasons. In Red River, John Wayne has to get that huge herd to market and has to use a trail few have used. In The Big Sky a group of independent trappers basically want to land a nice fur contract with the Blackfeet Indians where few whites have gone up the Missouri River. Going against them is a fur trading consortium kind of like the one John Jacob Astor put together.\n\nThe trappers are mostly French Canadian Metis headed by Steven Geray, but also along is Arthur Hunnicutt who speaks the Indian language. Their ace in the hole is Elizabeth Threatt, a Blackfoot princess the trappers have rescued and are bringing back to her people in the hopes that her old man will be grateful. Hunnicutt is also the narrator of the film.\n\nDouglas and Dewey Martin join up with the group in St. Louis and the trappers have the usual adventures as they take the flatboat up into the Missouri River country. The scenes showing journey upriver are nicely photographed.\n\nTwo others in the cast merit attention. Hank Worden does a nice job as a lost Blackfoot Indian who the trappers pick up. He may not be playing with a full deck, but he does come in handy. Jim Davis is one lean and mean villain as the company troubleshooter who wants to keep the independents out.\n\nArthur Hunnicutt got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role, The Big Sky proved to be his career film. Unfortunately he lost to Anthony Quinn for Viva Zapata. Still Hunnicutt's folksy charm was always something to look forward to in any film he was ever in.\n\nThe Big Sky is one of the best films ever done about the mountain man era of the American frontier. If they'd only spent for color.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4110,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"1952-10-24","keywords":"grand teton national park,yellowstone national park,native americans,voice over narration,narrated by character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4189896729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFiM2UwYzYtMTA2OS00Zjc3LWI3NDUtZWE2ODdhN2Q5NWYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFiM2UwYzYtMTA2OS00Zjc3LWI3NDUtZWE2ODdhN2Q5NWYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The success of the journey focuses on keeping the Indian girl alive as well as themselves to complete trade with the Blackfeet."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000018/","name":"Kirk Douglas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0552185/","name":"Dewey Martin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0861910/","name":"Elizabeth Threatt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001328/","name":"Howard Hawks"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078135/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0629580/","name":"Dudley Nichols"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0349238/","name":"A.B.

    <desc lang="fr">Portrait. Issu d'une famille d'intellectuels parisiens, Denis Gheerbrant se forme à l'IDHEC (maintenant rattaché à la Femis) en réalisation et prise de vue. En parallèle, il porte son regard partout où l'attire son appareil photo. Dès l'adolescence, il se sent " derrière une vitre " en compagnie des autres. C'est dans cette solitude qu'il trouve sa place, caméra à l'épaule, et commence à filmer la vie qui l'entoure, ses œuvres échappant aussi bien au genre du cinéma romanesque qu'au documentaire. Entre images et silences, il livre des bribes de réflexions sur le regard et les relations qui existent entre le sujet, le filmeur et sa caméra.</desc>

Be sure to stay till after the credits have rolled.\n\n7 out of 10, the sound track is a must buy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":109125,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2009-04-01","keywords":"pirate radio station,pop music,pirate radio,1960s,pirate broadcasting","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pirate Radio","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1266090521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2ODk3MTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM5NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2ODk3MTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM5NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A comedy about an illegal radio station in the North Sea in the 1960s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000450/","name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0631490/","name":"Bill Nighy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296545/","name":"Nick Frost"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"],"duration":"PT2H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Ip Man was the Wing Chun grandmaster and his most famous student was Bruce Lee. This film chronicles the years leading up to his success as a martial arts teacher. It stars Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as Ip Man and Zhang Ziyi as Gong Er, his main love interest. Kar Wai Wong directed and co-wrote the movie (with Jingzhi Zou and Haofeng Xu). Wong is famous for directing and writing other popular Hong Kong period piece dramas like '2046' and 'IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE'. I'd rate this flick about the same as Wong's others; I thought it was extremely beautiful to look at but it's also a tad too hard to follow and uninvolving.\n\nThe story focuses as much on Gong Er (Ziyi) as it does Ip Man and follows a love story between the two as they keep in contact for many years following a fight for Gong's family's honor. Ip Man had defeated her father, Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang) in a battle that was as much about philosophical ideas as combat. The film follows Ip Man's years during the Second Sino-Japanese War, in 1938, struggling through poverty with his family. It also focuses on Gong Er's attempt at vengeance against the man who murdered her father, Ma San (Zhang Jin).\n\nThe story is told in a very disjointed way and it was really hard for me to keep up with what was going on in it. I often find these epic Hong Kong Kung Fu flicks to be dull anyway and wasn't too interested in seeing this one. It did get mostly good reviews from critics though and it's nominated for two 2014 Oscars (in Cinematography and Costume Design). It definitely deserves those award nominations and is very breathtaking to look at. I also think Zhang Ziyi is one of the more beautiful and sexy women in cinema today and she gives a great performance here. I'm not sure how I feel about Leung Chiu-Wai as an actor, he's not bad in this movie but I didn't really learn to care for his character much at all. The martial-arts scenes are grand and epic though and I'm sure fans of the genre will be more than pleased.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTUUB4nMD6M","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32958,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-01-08","keywords":"ip man character,falling off a balcony,girl,crying,starving to death","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4109412633","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5NTA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMDc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5NTA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMDc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A story inspired by the life and times of the legendary kung fu master, Ip Man, and set in the tumultuous Republican era that followed the fall of ChinaÂ’s last dynasty, a time of chaos, division and war that was also the golden age of Chinese martial arts."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504897/","name":"Tony Chiu-Wai Leung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018221/","name":"Jin Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939182/","name":"Kar-Wai Wong"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070147/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074316/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239007/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939182/","name":"Kar-Wai Wong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1802940/","name":"Jingzhi Zou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4192630/","name":"Haofeng Xu"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Ben Stiller, who usually seems to have little clue how to use his specific talents, gives his best performance to date in front of and behind the camera. This is a film that may not resemble the source material verbatim, but the spirit is clearly alive, with a few touches to modernize the idea. As a whole, it's a sweet, confident, and poignant film that has a lot to say, but I think it speaks only to those willing to listen.\n\nWalter Mitty (Stiller) is a negative asset manager for Life magazine- basically, his is the department responsible for bringing in and processing the film from the field that will go into the magazine (and by his 'department', I mean Walter and his assistant (Martinez) ). In essence, in the time Walter has worked at the publication, the very soul of the magazine has been processed on his watch. It's prescient, that his seemingly simple position holds so much sway, but we'll return to that idea.\n\nHis problem, it seems, is that he daydreams. Mind you, this isn't the type of absent-mindedness that you or I take part in. Walter misses large chunks of actual time in his fantasy land, jolted back to reality by silence, love interests, or transition managers. In his escapes, Walter is well-traveled and mysterious, interesting and not invisible to others. He's confident and allowed to pursue that which he wants. In other words, he's the full version of himself. I like how this film pulls back the comedic reigns here- Stiller too often becomes, well, Stiller, and overdoses on the comedy. Here, the humor is subtle and fits the tone of the film. It also doesn't pander, or make us feel sorry for Walter. There's a very good reason his life is the way it is, and again, it's presented without pretense.\n\nI mentioned a transition manager, profiled in full douchebag by Adam Scott. Well, the print version of Life is going under in this film, and switching to an online format. Positions like Walter's are likely to be eliminated, as well as accounting spots like the one Cheryl (Wiig) holds down. However, before the end, they want to send up one last issue, and long-time contributor Sean O'Connell (Penn), who has sent a roll of film containing an image he specifically wants to become the last cover. The problem is that Walter has either misplaced it, or it was lost along the way. This causes him to seek it out, thus finally spurring him to make his fantasies become, well, realities.\n\nI think a good portion of society can identify with an individual that finally lets loose a bit, that allows himself, finally, the adventure he deserves. A lesser film would make these emotional breakthroughs farcical, ala "Last Holiday", but this is subtle and decent. That's why the big reveal of what that last cover image is a fantastic moment. I believed in this Walter Mitty as a hard- working guy who missed out on life thus far due to some bad luck. It was wonderfully refreshing to see a character, despite his quirks, find happiness in the midst of just being, well, a good guy.\n\nI caution those looking simply for a pandering, feel-good story around the holidays. That's not what this is. Instead, Stiller and crew have taken the spirit of the source material and adapted it to our world. Granted, there are a few goofs- for example, Walter seems keen on good rock music and skateboard culture, but he isn't aware of a popular David Bowie song? Also, how does one get a clementine cake, sweet as it may be, through customs? Those things don't doom the film, but I do feel it's another reason this will divide people- those that claim this has nothing to offer but cynical product placement messages, and those like myself that sense a broader theme of becoming who we want to be, and understanding where we lose our way. That's a powerful thought, and this quietly beautiful film has the sense to not beat us over the head with it. After all, the film does tell us that "beautiful things don't ask for attention".

The story is never too important when it's a comedy, it's all about the laughter. In this case I didn't laughed once, maybe one or two shy forced smiles. And even the story was pretty boring if you ask me. I don't know what they tried to do, probably being arty farty or something, but that's exactly the kind of movies I really don't like.

My big thank you to the 27th French Cinepanorama held in this month, after having gained twenty more years experience in life, now I know how to enjoy this movie. If I saw the movie right after it was freshly produced in 1983, I am very sure I would not understand the main plot or subplot, the observant director Claude Sautet, not to mention his ideas.

Both men are capable of winning the heart of many. Every one around them likes them. They go around women one after one pretty successfully, it's nothing novel to see that they have two or three at one time. For instance, Alex has frequent trysts with rich poodle Gloria, from whom he tactfully draws out a free-interest loan of FFr100,000. Besides, he is concurrently after Claire, an English language instructor whom he knew seventeen years ago at her father's wedding on a boat. On top of these two relationships, he keeps a punctuated contact with the down-and-out Coline.\n\nOn the surface, both Jerry and Alex are candies to all. Cruelly and honestly, it is Gilbert, Alex's room-mate and colleague, who is sharp at pointing out their common blind spot: they are not related to anybody, both American Jerry and French Alex only think about themselves. What different is, Jerry's ending gives us hope while the final rainy scene of Alex at his well-received amusement park tells us what reality tends to be like: remaining alone.\n\nWhen Alex is successful with his career, his dream park, all his women left: both Gloria and Claire return to their husbands, Coline follows a younger waiter of the restaurant.

With the indecision that best characterizes him, he tries to win her back while jeopardizing both his relationship with his current girlfriend Muriel and his work for the football player.\n\nThe thing that seduced me the most in this droll comedy as one could wish, although the director Laurent Tirard inserted melancholic moments which never break the tone and the storytelling of the film is the things Raphaël and Kevin say about books dealing with celebrities.

He was the ideal man for this role unlike Claude Miller's versatile "Betty Fisher et Autres Histoires" (2001). And the direction of actors doesn't lie fallow. I was very taken with Marie-Josée Croze and the formidable sincerity she gave to her character Muriel. Clovis Cornillac is also well served with his football player Kevin who is as uncertain as Raphaël but on another basis. He doesn't know which style to confer to his biography! Why not "à la Charles Baudelaire"? Unless another idea comes to his mind...\n\nThe film showcases a scene which sums up best Raphaël's antsy state of mind: he's in his car on a street of Paris. The lights turn green but he doesn't move off and starts to cry. Not only because of Jeff's death but also because of the ghost life he leads in which he acts an impostor. It's high time he set out his stalls and a chain of unexpected events will unconsciously steer him towards his real direction...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1595,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-09-08","keywords":"self discovery,romantic rivalry,pregnancy,narrative,ghost writer","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046347/","name":"Edouard Baer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0189887/","name":"Marie-Josée Croze"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180404/","name":"Clovis Cornillac"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016687/","name":"Laurent Tirard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037192/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016687/","name":"Laurent Tirard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0897065/","name":"Grégoire Vigneron"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Why not "à la Charles Baudelaire"? Unless another idea comes to his mind...\n\nThe film showcases a scene which sums up best Raphaël's antsy state of mind: he's in his car on a street of Paris. The lights turn green but he doesn't move off and starts to cry. Not only because of Jeff's death but also because of the ghost life he leads in which he acts an impostor. It's high time he set out his stalls and a chain of unexpected events will unconsciously steer him towards his real direction...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1595,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-09-08","keywords":"self discovery,romantic rivalry,pregnancy,narrative,ghost writer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046347/","name":"Edouard Baer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0189887/","name":"Marie-Josée Croze","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180404/","name":"Clovis Cornillac"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016687/","name":"Laurent Tirard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037192/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016687/","name":"Laurent Tirard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0897065/","name":"Grégoire Vigneron"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

At the movie's beginning, we are informed that over 100,000 wild mustangs roam in the US, from which several hundreds are taken to prisons each year for training by inmates. The opening scenes bring us one of those round-ups, as a chopper is directing a herd of mustangs towards captivity. We are introduced to Roman, locked up (for what crime?) in a maximum security prison in Nevada. "I'm not good with people", he tells the reclassification officer, so she puts him in the outdoor maintenance program. Initially it's just cleaning up horse manure, but eventually he gets to work with one of the mustangs. In a parallel story, Roman is visited by his highly pregnant daughter, and their meeting is - strained... At this point we're 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the feature length directing debut of Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre (better known for her acting career in France), and what a debut it is! She also co-wrote the script. She brings a multi-faceted story: yes, there is the redemption side where a hardened criminal finds new hope when bonding with a mustang, but there is also the complicated father-daughter angle (which surprised me on several occasions as that played out), and of course there is the aspect of life in prison. Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts was made to play the role of Roman: a very physical yet nuanced performance (in the same way that it reminded me of Marlon Brando--but I'm not saying that Schoenaerts is in the league of Brando!). Bruce Dern has a small role as the heard of the mustang training program. The photography is eye-candy from start to finish. And then there are the mustangs, themselves a character in the movie. In the end, the biggest treasure that was uncovered in this film may well be Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre. I can't wait to see what she will do next. (Please note that Robert Redford is credited as Executive Producer.)\n\n"The Mustang" premiered to immediate acclaim at this year's Sundance film festival, It is not a coincidence that this movie is currently certified 95% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. "The Mustang" recently opened at my art-house movie theater here in Cincinnati. The Friday early evening screening where I saw this at was attended poorly (5 people to be exact, myself included). That is a shame. Maybe the movie will find a wider audience as it is released in different formats.

Still, despite very good reviews, there was always a severe lack of hype and passion it seemed (certainly here). Maybe that's why I was so surprised. Usually this kind of heavy-edited, heavy- flashback-intercutting-with-main-story film alienates me emotionally for that reason. Too much back and forth. I had the same problem with 2007's Into The Wild, which so often prevented me from getting too involved with it. For some reason I didn't have that problem here. The actual story, as well as the dramatic ticks in the flashbacks and even in the present, aren't anything we haven't seen before dozens of times. However, the film really managed work despite that. The editing I found to enhance the film immensely, and the specific style of the intercutting with her memories managed to make the film more powerful. \n\nI like Witherspoon just fine in Walk The Line, but it was all mostly surface-level. She was fun, but any lasting impact? Not at all. She's truly fantastic here, and she will get a very deserved nomination tomorrow. Now, everyone knows how much I'd been rooting for Laura Dern for a nomination. I hadn't seen it, but she's one of my favorite actresses. But so many reports of her role being super small, almost a cameo. Her role technically is super small, less than 10 minutes for sure, but the relationship between her and Witherspoon is the central relationship at the core here. Dern's presence is felt throughout to an incredible degree. And she really does have a meaty role for such short screen time. It reminds me of Jessica Chastain in The tree Of Life and also to Patricia Arquette in Boyhood, perfect depiction of that feeling of compassion and motherly love that is eternal. Dern is one of those actors that can move me with so little, so I don't think this was at all anything difficult for her, but either way, she manages to become such an undeniable, powerful part of the film. The editing is part of the reason that central relationship works, but the scenes Dern gets to convey her entire character are flawlessly acted and, so beautifully ethereal. I had feared for a while there that it would be such a small role she'd make no lasting impact, but of course she'd make an impact.

It's dreamlike scenes on islands really got to me. You really felt like you were a traveler. It was also awesome how an eerie secret comes about, regarding a secret island.

Brainy but reclusive, she is so driven to create good work that her life is consumed with writing and research. Not only that, she is now bunking with her parents, for her old apartment has to be "fumigated". Naturally, her parents want Mary to experience love, marriage, and children so they keep trying to get her out of the house. Setting her up with the son of close friends, Mary reluctantly agrees to go out with Steve (Bradley Cooper). But, oh joy! Steve is a looker and has an intriguing job as the cameraman for a cable news reporter, Hartman (Thomas Haden Church). Mary likes, likes, likes what she sees. But, since the puzzle-writer won't stop talking and makes heavy romantic advances, Steve gets spooked only minutes into their first date and he bolts, citing his need to get to a new work assignment. But, Mary is dizzy in love. She bumbles her next crossword duties, gets fired and, suddenly, decides to follow Steve to his current location, and the next one, too. Steve is horrified and tries to get rid of her but Hartman tells Mary, privately, that Steve is secretly happy she is there and that she should not get discouraged in her pursuit of love. Its a puzzlement! Will Mary get her heart's desire? In the world of romantic comedies, this one is an odd duck. It is interesting and has many good elements but doesn't achieve overall success. However, its weaknesses do not include the cast, for Bullock, Cooper, and especially Haden Church, are great. All of the supporting cast members are very fine, too. In fact, its the actors' skills that elevate the film beyond its script and tentative direction. Yes, it tries to make some good statements about individuality, media hype, and the like. But, it never totally succeeds in getting its points across with aplomb. On a lesser note, the costumes and sets are quite nice indeed. In short, if you love Bullock, Cooper, Haden Church or quirky movies, you might give this one a whirl.

It really impressed me there.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2013-04-24","keywords":"reference to jean paul sartre,water lily,philosophy,absurdism,surrealism","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4269714713","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyOTE1OTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEwMzk4MTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyOTE1OTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEwMzk4MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in a charmingly surreal Paris, wealthy bachelor Colin spends his time developing his pianocktail (a cocktail-making piano) and devouring otherworldly dishes prepared by his trusty chef Nicolas. When Colin learns that his best friend Chick, a fellow acolyte of the philosopher Jean-Sol Partre, has a new American girlfriend, our lonely hero attends a friend's party in hopes of falling in love himself. He soon meets Chloe and, before they know it, they're dancing to Duke Ellington and plunging headfirst into a romance. Their whirlwind courtship is tested when an unusual illness plagues Chloe; a flower begins to grow in her lungs. To save her, Colin discovers the only cure is to surround Chloe with a never-ending supply of fresh flowers.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244151/","name":"Romain Duris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0255362/","name":"Gad Elmaleh"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0327273/","name":"Michel Gondry"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314274/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002435/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0327273/","name":"Michel Gondry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2236676/","name":"Luc Bossi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0895644/","name":"Boris Vian"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Billy Crystal and Bette Midler made a great pairing, I don't know why it hadn't been done before. Crystal brings his great acerbic wit combined with Midler's warm demeanor and the great comedic timing of both makes for gold medal hilarity. Marisa Tomei is great as a new-age parent with high anxiety when it comes to allowing her parents into her automated life. Bailee Madison is a little fireball, and she is one to keep an eye on. With her innate acting ability she will have you on the edge of tears one moment and laughing till you pee the next. Madison is an absolute joy to watch and it was great to see her paired up with classic comedic talent like Crystal and Midler. The writing is fair, but luckily with such a well-placed cast you hardly notice those short-comings. This is definitely one I would take the whole family to, it's got enough for all to enjoy. I highly recommend it for the holiday season, it will have you walking out with a smile.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2012-12-25","keywords":"misbehavior,grandfather granddaughter relationship,fired,grandfather grandson relationship,grandmother granddaughter relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3366168345","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2Mzg5NjAwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQyMDY3OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2Mzg5NjAwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQyMDY3OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Artie and Diane agree to look after their three grandkids when their type-A helicopter parents need to leave town for work.

Billy Crystal and Bette Midler made a great pairing, I don't know why it hadn't been done before. Crystal brings his great acerbic wit combined with Midler's warm demeanor and the great comedic timing of both makes for gold medal hilarity. Marisa Tomei is great as a new-age parent with high anxiety when it comes to allowing her parents into her automated life. Bailee Madison is a little fireball, and she is one to keep an eye on. With her innate acting ability she will have you on the edge of tears one moment and laughing till you pee the next. Madison is an absolute joy to watch and it was great to see her paired up with classic comedic talent like Crystal and Midler. The writing is fair, but luckily with such a well-placed cast you hardly notice those short-comings. This is definitely one I would take the whole family to, it's got enough for all to enjoy. I highly recommend it for the holiday season, it will have you walking out with a smile.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2012-12-25","keywords":"misbehavior,grandfather granddaughter relationship,fired,grandfather grandson relationship,grandmother granddaughter relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3366168345","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2Mzg5NjAwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQyMDY3OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2Mzg5NjAwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjQyMDY3OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Artie and Diane agree to look after their three grandkids when their type-A helicopter parents need to leave town for work.

The excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes "A Grand Day Out," "The Wrong Trousers," and also "A Close Shave" some of the best animated footage ever put on television. Winning several Oscars and also countless other awards, Nick Park became quite the popular man in the U.K., yet his impact on the United States has not been big. After the third Wallace and Gromit short, there was all this speculation about a full-length Wallace and Gromit movie, yet for years nothing had happened. Then in 2000 instead of a full-length Wallace and Gromit film, we get another brilliant claymation film from Nick Park, which was Chicken Run, which almost got nominated for best picture in the Academy Awards. Perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove Park to finally work on a Wallace and Gromit project.\n\n5 years later (these kinds of films do take long you know) and a lot of anticipation, Wallace and Gromit finally hits the big screen. Despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this movie delivers in so many ways. This film will be a delight for both kids and parents. With tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults. This rather difficult technique is one that only Pixar has already perfected and DreamWorks has had a lot of trouble doing lately. Despite the DreamWorks logo slapped onto the poster, this film is mainly from the very creative staff of Aardman Animations.\n\nWallace and Gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople's crops from being ruined by rabbits, which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately. Their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection. Complications arise when Wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople. To add to that, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of Victor. Simple plot yes, but there is more than meets the eye, be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way, kind of like in the other Wallace and Gromit cartoons.\n\nIn animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film. Despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage, the payoff is fantastic. There is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice. Even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film. Whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible, or it is the oh-so-adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film, most Curse of the Were-Rabbit's humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late. Just picture the movie Madagascar, except funnier much fewer pop culture references, and better animation.\n\nCasting was great, even though in a film with not much dialogue, it was not that important. Peter Sallis yet again does a wonderful job as Wallace, even though in this movie there was no stand-out quote that can be used anytime (The Wrong Trousers: "It's the wrong trousers Gromit, and they've gone wrong!"). Ralph Fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain Victor and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit "Fight Club") lends her lovely voice as she plays Wallace's love interest. Even though nothing could top the final chase in "The Wrong Trousers," Curse of the Ware-Rabbit did have plenty of action scenes, including one fantastically done chase scene between Gromit and Victor's evil dog. Last but not least, the rabbits really steal the show at some moments. Whether it is their cute expressions, their funny movements, or their howling, the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars. The funniest rabbit in the movie is the "cursed" rabbit himself, to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter.\n\nBottom Line: Despite not being as memorable as "The Wrong Trousers", this film is just as good and entertaining as Chicken Run. Unlike almost every movie to come out this year, the movie does not drag at all, clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun, it will leave everyone watching it asking for more. There is very little wrong with the film; it was a pure delight to watch. This film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar, uncut, raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-Year-Old Virgin, Wedding Crashers, and Sin City) and for families and those who want harmless entertainment; that is a good thing. Highly recommend, this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade.

The excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes "A Grand Day Out," "The Wrong Trousers," and also "A Close Shave" some of the best animated footage ever put on television. Winning several Oscars and also countless other awards, Nick Park became quite the popular man in the U.K., yet his impact on the United States has not been big. After the third Wallace and Gromit short, there was all this speculation about a full-length Wallace and Gromit movie, yet for years nothing had happened. Then in 2000 instead of a full-length Wallace and Gromit film, we get another brilliant claymation film from Nick Park, which was Chicken Run, which almost got nominated for best picture in the Academy Awards. Perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove Park to finally work on a Wallace and Gromit project.\n\n5 years later (these kinds of films do take long you know) and a lot of anticipation, Wallace and Gromit finally hits the big screen. Despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this movie delivers in so many ways. This film will be a delight for both kids and parents. With tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults. This rather difficult technique is one that only Pixar has already perfected and DreamWorks has had a lot of trouble doing lately. Despite the DreamWorks logo slapped onto the poster, this film is mainly from the very creative staff of Aardman Animations.\n\nWallace and Gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople's crops from being ruined by rabbits, which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately. Their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection. Complications arise when Wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople. To add to that, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of Victor. Simple plot yes, but there is more than meets the eye, be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way, kind of like in the other Wallace and Gromit cartoons.\n\nIn animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film. Despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage, the payoff is fantastic. There is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice. Even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film. Whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible, or it is the oh-so-adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film, most Curse of the Were-Rabbit's humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late. Just picture the movie Madagascar, except funnier much fewer pop culture references, and better animation.\n\nCasting was great, even though in a film with not much dialogue, it was not that important. Peter Sallis yet again does a wonderful job as Wallace, even though in this movie there was no stand-out quote that can be used anytime (The Wrong Trousers: "It's the wrong trousers Gromit, and they've gone wrong!").

But "OSS 117 -Le Caire nid d'espions" and its sequel "OSS 117 Rio ne répond plus" fare much better than "Imogène McCarthery, despite the latter's excellent cast (Lambert Wilson, Michel Aumont, Danièle Lebrun, Lionel Abelanski and the three funny actors who play the Soviet spies, Francis Leplay, Nicolas Vaude and Pierre Laplace) and its satisfying natural and artificial settings. What makes the two former films superior to "Imogène" is that they are not content to tell their (superficial) story, they also play on the stereotypes of the B or Z-films of the period the action is set in. OSS 117 is a self-centered, racist chauvinist and does not realise it, whereas we spectators are aware of it Thus we laugh at the fool while, by extension, these human flaws are denounced. In "Imogène", on the contrary, you are asked to be complicit with the title character, who has similar foibles (she is an unrepentant Scottish nationalist, and base all of her behavior on this stiff principle, generating an endless series of repetitive gags). As a result, if you disapprove of ultra nationalism, you will not really have a ball watching Catherine Frot always criticizing the English and the Welsh or breaking her engagement just because her fiancé is too ... tolerant! "Imogène McCarthery" is the first film directed by Franck Magnier and Alexandre Charlot, who once wrote for the famous satiric TV show "Les Guignols de l'Info". Their texts were incisive and biting.

But "OSS 117 -Le Caire nid d'espions" and its sequel "OSS 117 Rio ne répond plus" fare much better than "Imogène McCarthery, despite the latter's excellent cast (Lambert Wilson, Michel Aumont, Danièle Lebrun, Lionel Abelanski and the three funny actors who play the Soviet spies, Francis Leplay, Nicolas Vaude and Pierre Laplace) and its satisfying natural and artificial settings.

    <title lang="fr">Le papillon</title>
    <desc lang="fr">Le papillon: Directed by Philippe Muyl. With Michel Serrault, Claire Bouanich, Nade Dieu, Jacques Bouanich. This is the story of a young girl named Elsa who was raised by a single mother (Isabelle) in the city. Isabelle and Elsa begin the film moving in next door to an elderly man who collects butterflies (Julien). Isabelle who "spends a lot of time with her friends" does not pay much attention to her daughter who walks home because her mother forgot to pick her up from school. After meeting her new neighbor, Elsa finds out about the butterflies and in short annoys Julien for a while. Julien receives a mystery package from a fellow entomologist. Julien sets out on his annual attempt to find a rare species of butterfly that he had once promised his son he would find (son dead) in the French country side, specifically a region known as Vercors. Elsa stows away in his car. After being discovered she convinces him to let her come to Vercors with him. They bond while hiking and camping until Julien, who is initially annoyed by Elsa, near the end of the film seems to have a grandfather-granddaughter relationship with her. Elsa falls in a well. The police arrest Julien. Elsa tells everyone it is cool. Isabelle starts paying attention to her child. Julien and Elsa are friends. The mystery package contained a caterpillar which turned out to become the rare species of butterfly Julien set out to find. The species is called Isabelle.

Himalaya is a work of art.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1999-12-15","keywords":"nepal,buddhism,himalayas,salt,caravan","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Himalaya","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2494365977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0YjQ5YjMtNTE2Yi00ODJlLTllMDctMWE5Yjk5ZGJhNTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0YjQ5YjMtNTE2Yi00ODJlLTllMDctMWE5Yjk5ZGJhNTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0508303/","name":"Thilen Lhondup","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477312/","name":"Gurgon Kyap","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874661/","name":"Lhakpa Tsamchoe"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0885108/","name":"Eric Valli","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213340/","name":"Michel Debats"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058643/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013404/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0044383/","name":"Nathalie Azoulai","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206797/","name":"Olivier Dazat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0306627/","name":"Louis Gardel"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Nolan has outdone himself !!","reviewBody":"What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?\n\nDom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!\n\nBut then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'\n\nThen what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a "forger" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. \n\nThere is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.\n\nLeonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.\n\nTo conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! \n\nMy Rating: 10/10\n\nThanks &amp; Regards","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2165826,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nolan has outdone himself !!","reviewBody":"What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?\n\nDom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!\n\nBut then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'\n\nThen what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a "forger" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. \n\nThere is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.\n\nLeonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.\n\nTo conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! \n\nMy Rating: 10/10\n\nThanks &amp; Regards","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2165826,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The radioactive parts are called the colonies, where bad girls are sent to die of radiation poisoning. The time is the near future, after the inevitable nuclear war, and the breakdown of government as we know it.\n\nThe society depicted in The Handmaid's Tale is a nightmare: everyone is watched by the Eyes, unknowable, unseen government spies. Women are forbidden to have jobs. They are irrevocably assigned to classes. At the top are the chaste, but morally superior, Wives, almost all of whom have been rendered infertile by the inevitable unclear war. At the bottom are the housekeepers, or Marthas, who are non-entities. In the middle are the Handmaids of the title, who are fertile, but tightly controlled. The term Handmaid is a Biblical term that is used in the Old Testament stories of Abraham, Sarah, Jacob and Rachel.

They are prohibited from using makeup or doing anything to make themselves attractive. Handmaids are forced to turn their offspring over to the morally "fit" Wives.\n\nRobert Duvall, a Commander in whose home Offred is placed, gives a family Bible reading performance that will curdle the blood of true people of faith.

I really liked the first half, which is a visually striking, surreal existential drama that can be seen as a commentary on suburban life.\n\nAt first much of the movie is weirdly, darkly comical, but as it moves along the comical parts give way to despair and horror. This makes sense, and I think it's a reasonable direction for the movie to go based on its premise. But while the first half is *fun*, the second half is very much not, and that feels like a bit of a bait and switch.\n\nThe movie is also, at an hour and a half, too long.

I really liked the first half, which is a visually striking, surreal existential drama that can be seen as a commentary on suburban life.\n\nAt first much of the movie is weirdly, darkly comical, but as it moves along the comical parts give way to despair and horror. This makes sense, and I think it's a reasonable direction for the movie to go based on its premise. But while the first half is *fun*, the second half is very much not, and that feels like a bit of a bait and switch.\n\nThe movie is also, at an hour and a half, too long. It's basically an extended Twilight Zone episode that takes one concept and explores it. There aren't really twists per se, we never learn much about this world, we just see how these people's lives unfold in this bizarre situation.\n\nUltimately I'm torn between rating this 6 or 7, since parts of it are quite good.

The Millennium Films production "London Has Fallen" is really a glorified Cannon movie, and that's why I had fun with it. Oh, I will admit that a lot of it is silly and/or bad. The CGI is often kind of cheap, the depiction of the story's terrorists and their intricate plans is really hard to swallow, and the movie is quite predictable. But it's enjoyable all the same.

The Millennium Films production "London Has Fallen" is really a glorified Cannon movie, and that's why I had fun with it. Oh, I will admit that a lot of it is silly and/or bad. The CGI is often kind of cheap, the depiction of the story's terrorists and their intricate plans is really hard to swallow, and the movie is quite predictable. But it's enjoyable all the same. The first twenty five or so minutes are kind of slow, but then it starts delivering almost non stop action until the end. It's certainly never dull, and even a little exciting at times despite the fact you'll know how each scene will end as soon as it starts.

Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like "the only law is gravity" and "everyone dies, it's just a matter of how", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi.

His role should have been cut since he almost ruined the entire movie.\n\nMany people are complaining that the new rating kills the film and I disagree. The fight scenes are tamer and safer when compared to the original. He actually doesn't really use his sword to kill nor is much blood shown. However, the fight scenes are still pretty good and there are a lot of entertaining scenes like the train scene at the end. There were some boring scenes but they didn't last long. Also, the film is really cheesy and some of this does get annoying, nothing too major though. In the end, if you expect something like the original movie than you will end up disappointed.

So chances were quite good that the production qualities would be somewhat uncertain, even being based on Patricia Highsmith's novel, the same author of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" (1999), amazingly adapted by Anthony Minghella and one of the finest movies of his career.\n\nAfter Minghella's adaptation, which was praised by everyone for its outstanding visual and technical qualities, and his skills to develop the story as a captivating and progressive dramatic thriller, also including a character that does not exist in the book that instead of negatively change the course of the story only increased the hitchcockian tone he gave to the plot, Hollywood didn't produced anything like that since then. \n\nWhen people watch the trailer of "The Two Faces of January" some honorable resemblances to Minghella's adaptation of Highsmith's Ripley will pop, and strong comparisons will be inevitable. That's what I felt, so my expectations were high. The attempts to repeat the same successful formula were so evident that one of the executive producers is Max Minghella, son of the late director. \n\nReally, the comparisons cannot be avoided, but rather to become nostalgic references or even an excellent opportunity to honor Minghella and his merits achieved by one of his greatest works, "Two Faces Of January" becomes a very frustrating experience in many aspects. \n\nThe condensed narrative, the thrilling moments involving the unknown past of each one of the characters and some key events that occur within the first half hour conducted by Alberto Iglesias music (with great references to Bernard Herrmann's in Psycho) clearly lead and prepare the viewer to a thrilling expected atmosphere. But unfortunately the robustness presented loses strength when the story achieves a shallow plateau that forgets to explore the past of each one of the characters as well as never taking truly advantage of their personal psychological conflicts as happen in the book, especially Rydal, the main character.\n\nThe title is a reference to Janus, a roman god with two faces, guardian of the transitions, doors, decisions and the beginning. One face looks to the past and the other to the future. This mythical figure represents the reckoning that Rydal is about to face and the dangerous decisions he will have to take. Also, the story take place in early January, which also means a new beginning in popular culture. In the book Highsmith makes clear those associations with the title when Rydal feels a strange and painful resemblance between Chester and his late father, and between Colette and a girl he was madly in love when a teenager. The transference he makes of these two strong figures of his life to Chester and Colette is what leads Rydal keeps himself close to them in the unconscious quest to solve his traumatic relationship with his hateful father and also try to continue an interrupted love interest he had in the past. \n\nBut in the movie, none of this fundamental matters are explored the way it should. There are only brief moments that loosely make clear Chester's resemblances to Rydal's late father but no major developments about that is given to clarify the reasons why the love-hate relationship grows so strong between them. Hossein makes it feels like all the love-hate relationship is because they share the same love interest: Colette. On the contrary of the psychological thriller that the book is, the movie makes it all a common passion crime flick, with silly police chasings, love triangle in the simplest possible way exploiting a naive Colette that does not exist, since the book makes reference to her recurring infidelity. The result is an empty movie with a trite ending that makes entire plot feels redundant rather than being Rydal's final journey in search for absolution over his most inner conflicts.\n\nEven developing an excellent job, Viggo Mortensen has his talent wasted here because of the forgettable film that it strikingly is. Kirsten Dunst seems to not yet have learned how to be sophisticated without always look like a college student, and as always, her best moments are when her character is under pressure. Wasted are also the locations in Greece and Turkey instead of doing the same thing Minghella did when making all the exuberance within the Italian landscapes an extra mix of beauty and soft cruelty in "The Talented Mr. Ripley". Oscar Isaac has impressive moments, perhaps because he did know the original work and also that his character is much more complex than the script provided, but for the viewer that is poorly cleared thru the 96 minutes, the attitudes of his character will feel just like an empty and romantically misplaced fixation without any coherent foundation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30560,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Romance","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-05-16","keywords":"greece,ruins,athens greece,american in europe,foot chase","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2448730905","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MDQ0NTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk1MjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MDQ0NTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk1MjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"1962, Athens: Rydal, a young man acting as a tour guide while scamming visitors on the side gets entangled in the lives of Chester and Colette MacFarland, a seemingly glamorous American couple.

Since the 60's, the french directors have always been fascinating by American cinema. But most of them use the American cinema's codes to transpose them in a french environment : from Truffaut' "Tirez Sur Le Pianiste" - which plays with the stereotypes of the Film noir in a french universe - to Gans' "Pacte Des loups" - which transposes the western codes in the pre-revolutionary France.\n\nAnd it seems that, with "Quatre étoiles", Christian Vincent tries to archive this form of transformation of American's codes with the french touch. Indeed, the director quotes himself American's comedies from the 40's and says they're direct influence to make this film. "Quatre étoiles" tries to transfers the atmosphere of American's classical comedies from Los Angeles to Cannes. But unfortunately, it doesn't work. Why ? \n\nLike in a Cukor' or Lubitch' comedy, the character - a young an inconstant woman - inherit, out of nowhere, 50000 euros and decides to spend it all in a week in Cannes, where, in search of adventures, she falls in love with a small time crook, played by José Garcia. And if a lot of situations are similar to 40's and 50's American films, it never reaches their level of grace and humor. It's true that we have, like in American movies, a young and in-experimented girl who knows exactly what she wants, and who decides to change her life and social position in a day, and that we also have an impossible love story between two characters who hate each other, and are still stuck together, but everything seems so small compared to its models.\n\nWhen, in a American movie, the character would have inherit millions of dollars, the character here has only a few euros left, which can't provokes great and hilarious contrasted situations. The movie always avoid absurd situations and epic quiproquos, like it is afraid of its comical potential : everything stays calm and little, like the characters, who are just a reduction of American stereotypes : like the talkative-but-not-so-bad-crook. And when you reduce stereotypes, nothing much stays.\n\nWhat stays after this very little movie is a small impression of boring, just tempered by the presence of the great Francois Cluzet, who plays a very funny half-brained ex-formula 1 driver, who falls in love with the wrong girl.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1269,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-05-03","keywords":"riviera,bath,topless female nudity,female nudity,paris france","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2180234265","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M2YTI4ZDctYzk0MS00NDA3LTk0YjQtODdiNTE5OWI1NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M2YTI4ZDctYzk0MS00NDA3LTk0YjQtODdiNTE5OWI1NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305296/","name":"José Garcia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494161/","name":"Renée Le Calm"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0141140/","name":"Isabelle Carré"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898603/","name":"Christian Vincent"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037192/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206797/","name":"Olivier Dazat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898603/","name":"Christian Vincent"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And when you reduce stereotypes, nothing much stays.\n\nWhat stays after this very little movie is a small impression of boring, just tempered by the presence of the great Francois Cluzet, who plays a very funny half-brained ex-formula 1 driver, who falls in love with the wrong girl.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1269,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-05-03","keywords":"riviera,bath,topless female nudity,female nudity,paris france","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2180234265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M2YTI4ZDctYzk0MS00NDA3LTk0YjQtODdiNTE5OWI1NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M2YTI4ZDctYzk0MS00NDA3LTk0YjQtODdiNTE5OWI1NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305296/","name":"José Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494161/","name":"Renée Le Calm","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0141140/","name":"Isabelle Carré"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898603/","name":"Christian Vincent"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037192/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206797/","name":"Olivier Dazat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898603/","name":"Christian Vincent"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geo-political situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic , a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinema \n\nYou can't fault the film for its production values . It contains a who's who of prestigious big hitting British character actors such as Oldman , Hurt and Firth alongside up and coming peers such as Hardy and Cumberbatch . We also get a host of under rated actors in Strong and Burke and at a casting level none of this can be faulted . The look of the film is fantastic with the brownish dull hues reflecting both Communist Eastern Europe and run down Britain in the early 1970s and a day after seeing the movie my abiding memory of the film is the cinematography \n\nThe problem is that - and I'm afraid to admit this - is that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time . A British agent is shot and caputured in Hungary and MI6 believes he was set up by a mole . I understood this but then we cut to a character after character discussing who the mole might be , do we have a mole and we don't have a mole and very soon I was very lost . This film topped the film charts in Britain for a grand total of three weeks and one suspects by way of a backhanded compliment many people went to the cinema for a second and third time in order to unravel the plot .

Every once in a while, particularly during summer months when studios are rolling out their blockbuster hopefuls, you'll see a couple of movies released that seem to be mirror images of one-another. Not exactly the same, but similar enough that it seems like they must have some common ancestor.\n\nThe reason why this happens is pretty straight forward and has to do with the unusual way the movie industry works. Often, the scripts for movies aren't developed in-house by the studios, but rather purchased from freelance writers who come up with an idea and then "pitch" it to multiple studios looking for a buyer.\n\nThe process works for both the writers and the studios. There is a catch, however, which is that the person pitching relies upon a studio honoring an informal agreement not to use an idea without compensating the creator. The problem is that less scrupulous studio executives will have no problem passing on an idea and then blatantly copying it for their own movie. And even though everyone involved knows what's happening, it's pretty rare for anyone to actually sue over it, so it tends to keep happening.\n\nA famous example of this (famous in the relative sense) happened with the movies 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. The original author who pitched 'Deep Impact' watched a studio exec take copious notes during the pitch, pass on it, and then rush to create a script and get his ripped off version made in time to compete with 'Deep Impact', which was purchased by another studio.\n\nThis usually happens when someone creates a script that captures the zeitgeist; that taps into an idea that just clicks with what people are talking and thinking about and it becomes the "must have" idea of the year.\n\nUnless you're an industry insider, it can be difficult to know which movie was the original concept and which was the ripoff, but generally the original idea will be more polished and well thought out. 'Armageddon', for example, famously had such huge plot holes that the cast was complaining about them during filming.\n\n'Olympus Has Fallen' (OHF) came out around the same time as 'White House Down' (WHD). Both movies feature an attack on the white house with an invading force, aided by a turncoat secret service agent, conquering the presidential security in an attempt to take him hostage. Both movies also have a protagonist who isn't secret service, but has some connection to the agency and ultimately proves that he deserves to be guarding the president. Both movies involve protecting a child caught in the crossfire. Both have failed attempts by special forces to re-take the building. Both involve explosions that destroy the building. Both movies involve forcing a change to foreign policy. And so on, you get the idea.\n\nI don't know which was the original, but I have a guess. The movies were made during the presidency of Barack Obama. After he was elected, there was a lot of speculation about whether he would be the subject of an assassination attempt. To African Americans Obama represented an almost unbelievable event: one of their own elected to the most powerful office in the nation. And there was a great deal of angst about losing him violently, the way a number of prominent black leaders had been lost in the past. I think that was the kernel that sparked the original screenplay; this clash of the old power base and the new one in the symbolic seat of national power.\n\nTo my mind, WHD was the liberal take on the idea while OHF was the conservative counter. WHD featured a charismatic black president clearly modeled after Obama, right down to his attempts to quit smoking. The villains are white supremacist types backed by the old-guard military industrial complex who are fearful of the changes the president was making to foreign policy. And the protagonist is a millennial trying to prove he was worthy of the responsibility of protecting the president, perhaps an analogy for the young political activists that brought new methods of campaigning to Obama's election.\n\nOHF, by contrast, features a white male president with villains who were almost exclusively Asian, and rather than representing the supporters of the status quo they are actively looking to tear down American force abroad, suggesting that the bad guys can't stand how effective the traditional American foreign policy is. In other words, the message is "we are winning and they are getting desperate". Even the protagonist is more representative of the target audience: a middle-aged man with a penchant for defiantly vowing to destroy the villains and defend our way of life.\n\nNeither movie is particularly deep; it's mostly about the action sequences. In other words, these are popcorn movies. But I do think it's interesting how two such similar base ideas can manifest such different messages.

Every once in a while, particularly during summer months when studios are rolling out their blockbuster hopefuls, you'll see a couple of movies released that seem to be mirror images of one-another. Not exactly the same, but similar enough that it seems like they must have some common ancestor.\n\nThe reason why this happens is pretty straight forward and has to do with the unusual way the movie industry works. Often, the scripts for movies aren't developed in-house by the studios, but rather purchased from freelance writers who come up with an idea and then "pitch" it to multiple studios looking for a buyer.\n\nThe process works for both the writers and the studios. There is a catch, however, which is that the person pitching relies upon a studio honoring an informal agreement not to use an idea without compensating the creator. The problem is that less scrupulous studio executives will have no problem passing on an idea and then blatantly copying it for their own movie. And even though everyone involved knows what's happening, it's pretty rare for anyone to actually sue over it, so it tends to keep happening.\n\nA famous example of this (famous in the relative sense) happened with the movies 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. The original author who pitched 'Deep Impact' watched a studio exec take copious notes during the pitch, pass on it, and then rush to create a script and get his ripped off version made in time to compete with 'Deep Impact', which was purchased by another studio.\n\nThis usually happens when someone creates a script that captures the zeitgeist; that taps into an idea that just clicks with what people are talking and thinking about and it becomes the "must have" idea of the year.\n\nUnless you're an industry insider, it can be difficult to know which movie was the original concept and which was the ripoff, but generally the original idea will be more polished and well thought out. 'Armageddon', for example, famously had such huge plot holes that the cast was complaining about them during filming.\n\n'Olympus Has Fallen' (OHF) came out around the same time as 'White House Down' (WHD). Both movies feature an attack on the white house with an invading force, aided by a turncoat secret service agent, conquering the presidential security in an attempt to take him hostage. Both movies also have a protagonist who isn't secret service, but has some connection to the agency and ultimately proves that he deserves to be guarding the president. Both movies involve protecting a child caught in the crossfire. Both have failed attempts by special forces to re-take the building. Both involve explosions that destroy the building. Both movies involve forcing a change to foreign policy. And so on, you get the idea.\n\nI don't know which was the original, but I have a guess. The movies were made during the presidency of Barack Obama. After he was elected, there was a lot of speculation about whether he would be the subject of an assassination attempt. To African Americans Obama represented an almost unbelievable event: one of their own elected to the most powerful office in the nation. And there was a great deal of angst about losing him violently, the way a number of prominent black leaders had been lost in the past. I think that was the kernel that sparked the original screenplay; this clash of the old power base and the new one in the symbolic seat of national power.\n\nTo my mind, WHD was the liberal take on the idea while OHF was the conservative counter. WHD featured a charismatic black president clearly modeled after Obama, right down to his attempts to quit smoking. The villains are white supremacist types backed by the old-guard military industrial complex who are fearful of the changes the president was making to foreign policy. And the protagonist is a millennial trying to prove he was worthy of the responsibility of protecting the president, perhaps an analogy for the young political activists that brought new methods of campaigning to Obama's election.\n\nOHF, by contrast, features a white male president with villains who were almost exclusively Asian, and rather than representing the supporters of the status quo they are actively looking to tear down American force abroad, suggesting that the bad guys can't stand how effective the traditional American foreign policy is. In other words, the message is "we are winning and they are getting desperate". Even the protagonist is more representative of the target audience: a middle-aged man with a penchant for defiantly vowing to destroy the villains and defend our way of life.\n\nNeither movie is particularly deep; it's mostly about the action sequences. In other words, these are popcorn movies. But I do think it's interesting how two such similar base ideas can manifest such different messages. While WHD is about the (then) rising tide of the progressive political movement and the supposed fear within groups that traditionally held power in the US, OHF is all about the traditional conservative message of Jingoism and the need to protect ourselves from the parts of the world that don't share our values.\n\nWhatever the case may be, OHF was successful enough to green light a second film 'London Has Fallen', which is a continuation of the themes, only with (primarily) middle-eastern villains instead of Asian ones, and an upcoming 'Angel Has Fallen'. Personally, I thought OHF was decent but unspectacular.

Kim Ki-duk is one of the most notable exceptions. Being Korea's most notorious film maker isn't an easy accomplishment in the first place, given that no other country produces so many veritable authors of cinema. But being able to increase the radicality of one's cinematic language while maintaining the same themes is quite a feat indeed.\n\nKim's Golden Lion-winning previous work 'Pieta' was already almost silent; with 'Moebius' he has not only succeeded in making an entertaining silent film which isn't a reminiscence of a bygone era, but actually managed to push the limits of film as a medium a bit further ahead. The closest film which could compare is 'Themroc', not just because there's no dialog apart from lascivious or painful grunts, but because it almost seems to be a parody of that film's social critique: 'Moebius' quite on the contrary admits to its own silliness.\n\nMany reviewers seem to take the symbols too seriously. The Buddha heads, knifes used for castration and masturbation and of course the body part which is the main plot device (as well as what the title may ironically refer to) - they may all mean something, but they certainly don't have to. There may be tons of allusions to Greek mythology, but it's entirely possible that this is just what you want - or do not want - to read into the film. If these metaphors were any clearer - then this would make 'Moebius' a lot less brilliant. I prefer to think that, as in many of Kim's previous films, it's the effect which is the meaning, and there's not much of a meaning hidden underneath the effect.\n\nWhich is why I think of 'Moebius' as one of this year's very few 'must-sees' - unless one suffers from castration anxiety.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5575,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-09-05","keywords":"knife,mother son incest,male full frontal nudity,genital mutilation,castration","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Moebius","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2716642329","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZmZTU0YjYtYjc5Ni00YmY1LWE2ZDgtMzRiNGVmM2RiYWU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZmZTU0YjYtYjc5Ni00YmY1LWE2ZDgtMzRiNGVmM2RiYWU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Moebius"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0128345/","name":"Jae-Hyun Cho"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5178424/","name":"Yeong-ju Seo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3569306/","name":"Na-ra Lee"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1104118/","name":"Kim Ki-duk"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119829/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1104118/","name":"Kim Ki-duk"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But being able to increase the radicality of one's cinematic language while maintaining the same themes is quite a feat indeed.\n\nKim's Golden Lion-winning previous work 'Pieta' was already almost silent; with 'Moebius' he has not only succeeded in making an entertaining silent film which isn't a reminiscence of a bygone era, but actually managed to push the limits of film as a medium a bit further ahead. The closest film which could compare is 'Themroc', not just because there's no dialog apart from lascivious or painful grunts, but because it almost seems to be a parody of that film's social critique: 'Moebius' quite on the contrary admits to its own silliness.\n\nMany reviewers seem to take the symbols too seriously. The Buddha heads, knifes used for castration and masturbation and of course the body part which is the main plot device (as well as what the title may ironically refer to) - they may all mean something, but they certainly don't have to. There may be tons of allusions to Greek mythology, but it's entirely possible that this is just what you want - or do not want - to read into the film. If these metaphors were any clearer - then this would make 'Moebius' a lot less brilliant. I prefer to think that, as in many of Kim's previous films, it's the effect which is the meaning, and there's not much of a meaning hidden underneath the effect.\n\nWhich is why I think of 'Moebius' as one of this year's very few 'must-sees' - unless one suffers from castration anxiety.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5575,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-09-05","keywords":"knife,mother son incest,male full frontal nudity,genital mutilation,castration","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Moebius","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2716642329","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZmZTU0YjYtYjc5Ni00YmY1LWE2ZDgtMzRiNGVmM2RiYWU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZmZTU0YjYtYjc5Ni00YmY1LWE2ZDgtMzRiNGVmM2RiYWU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Moebius","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0128345/","name":"Jae-Hyun Cho","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5178424/","name":"Yeong-ju Seo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3569306/","name":"Na-ra Lee"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1104118/","name":"Kim Ki-duk"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119829/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1104118/","name":"Kim Ki-duk"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However, while I adored DELICATESSEN and gave it a very high score, I wasn't nearly as impressed by CITY OF LOST CHILDREN--mostly because this film seemed to emphasize set design and weirdness, while plot seemed almost unimportant. In DELICATESSEN, there were of course the weirdness and odd sets, but the story and acting was so much more important and this made me care much more for the characters. In CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, it felt more like I was gawking at a freak show and there was just no emotional involvement--none.\n\nIn many ways, the film was reminiscent of several of Terry Gilliam's films--particularly BRAZIL. However, once again, BRAZIL had better characters and made me laugh. CITY OF LOST KIDS was just creepy and weird but with practically no charm.\n\nNow this isn't to say it's a bad film or that I didn't like it--I did. But instead of an involving or funny film, it was almost all visuals and weirdness. As for the plot, it sure took me a long time to even understand what was happening--and it seemed like I needed captions to explain the captions as I read along with the film!! But given the amazing sets and cool characters, it still kept my attention. I particularly enjoyed seeing Dominique Pinon playing a bunch of clones. I have liked this odd looking actor ever since I first saw him in DIVA and he was the best character in both this film and DELICATESSEN. His delivery and manner is just captivating.\n\nNow usually in most of my reviews I give a summary of the plot. Here it's very tough because I still am not 100% sure what I saw!! It all involves an evil genius who was created by one of the Dominique Pinons. This guy spends much of the movie kidnapping kids and trying to steal their dreams (kind of like an evil twist on MONSTERS INC.). At the same time, some evil freaks led by conjoined twins are thrown in as rival baddies. In the midst of this, Ron Perlman (who speaks no French in real life) and a little girl set off in search of Perlman's stolen little brother.

However, while I adored DELICATESSEN and gave it a very high score, I wasn't nearly as impressed by CITY OF LOST CHILDREN--mostly because this film seemed to emphasize set design and weirdness, while plot seemed almost unimportant. In DELICATESSEN, there were of course the weirdness and odd sets, but the story and acting was so much more important and this made me care much more for the characters. In CITY OF LOST CHILDREN, it felt more like I was gawking at a freak show and there was just no emotional involvement--none.\n\nIn many ways, the film was reminiscent of several of Terry Gilliam's films--particularly BRAZIL. However, once again, BRAZIL had better characters and made me laugh. CITY OF LOST KIDS was just creepy and weird but with practically no charm.\n\nNow this isn't to say it's a bad film or that I didn't like it--I did. But instead of an involving or funny film, it was almost all visuals and weirdness. As for the plot, it sure took me a long time to even understand what was happening--and it seemed like I needed captions to explain the captions as I read along with the film!! But given the amazing sets and cool characters, it still kept my attention. I particularly enjoyed seeing Dominique Pinon playing a bunch of clones. I have liked this odd looking actor ever since I first saw him in DIVA and he was the best character in both this film and DELICATESSEN. His delivery and manner is just captivating.\n\nNow usually in most of my reviews I give a summary of the plot. Here it's very tough because I still am not 100% sure what I saw!! It all involves an evil genius who was created by one of the Dominique Pinons. This guy spends much of the movie kidnapping kids and trying to steal their dreams (kind of like an evil twist on MONSTERS INC.). At the same time, some evil freaks led by conjoined twins are thrown in as rival baddies. In the midst of this, Ron Perlman (who speaks no French in real life) and a little girl set off in search of Perlman's stolen little brother. There's more to it than that, but really I didn't think the story was that important--it was more a chance to give a canvas to all the weird sets and characters.\n\nOverall, I liked seeing the film but I never came close to loving it. I recommend it for those with an appreciation for the very weird and perhaps lovers of French cinema.

It is really, really very good. It gives a very good flavor of the politics world, uses and customs, men, women, and so on. You see how people handle power, how power ends up controlling them. At no moment it is a "left wing" or a "right wing" movie, but it really focuses on the human dimension of the people. It uses many historical details from former 5th republic presidents, such as Miterrand (left), Giscard (right), Chirac (current one, right), De Gaulle (right/center). Dupontel is really amazing considering the all different types of roles he can fit in. In Bernie, in Monique, in this one, he plays 3 totally different persons, but always very accurately and well. To sum up, this is worth seeing. The girl (president's daughter is really cute, though she is not the best actor in the movie). The dude (Mathieu) is doomed to be loved by girls, and it's true that he is nearly perfect.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":557,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-09-20","keywords":"french president,female rear nudity","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0243355/","name":"Albert Dupontel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753737/","name":"Jérémie Renier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0723623/","name":"Claude Rich"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0217803/","name":"Lionel Delplanque"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065548/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079800/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0146460/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0217803/","name":"Lionel Delplanque"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1217275/","name":"Raphaël Meltz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2409312/","name":"Agnès Caffin"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is really, really very good. It gives a very good flavor of the politics world, uses and customs, men, women, and so on. You see how people handle power, how power ends up controlling them. At no moment it is a "left wing" or a "right wing" movie, but it really focuses on the human dimension of the people. It uses many historical details from former 5th republic presidents, such as Miterrand (left), Giscard (right), Chirac (current one, right), De Gaulle (right/center). Dupontel is really amazing considering the all different types of roles he can fit in. In Bernie, in Monique, in this one, he plays 3 totally different persons, but always very accurately and well. To sum up, this is worth seeing. The girl (president's daughter is really cute, though she is not the best actor in the movie). The dude (Mathieu) is doomed to be loved by girls, and it's true that he is nearly perfect.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":557,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-09-20","keywords":"french president,female rear nudity","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0243355/","name":"Albert Dupontel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753737/","name":"Jérémie Renier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0723623/","name":"Claude Rich"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0217803/","name":"Lionel Delplanque"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065548/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079800/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0146460/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0217803/","name":"Lionel Delplanque","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1217275/","name":"Raphaël Meltz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2409312/","name":"Agnès Caffin"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Hopefully her hand is on the pulse of a lot of different subsets of culture.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40629,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2016-10-14","keywords":"road movie,jealousy,truck stop,runaway,road trip","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"American Honey","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi832944921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjVjODgyNGItOTM0Yi00YTEzLTgyYTYtOTQ1MjRjZGU3YTQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjVjODgyNGItOTM0Yi00YTEzLTgyYTYtOTQ1MjRjZGU3YTQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for American Honey","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7603745/","name":"Sasha Lane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479471/","name":"Shia LaBeouf","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2142336/","name":"Riley Keough"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0036349/","name":"Andrea Arnold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0337243/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0715579/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0036349/","name":"Andrea Arnold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8237023/","name":"Ian Urbina"],"duration":"PT2H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The vacationers include the Mossbacher family - Nicole (Connie Britton), a successful type-A exec, who can't help but treat her family like disobedient employees; her husband, Mark (Steve Zahn), dealing with both an embarrassing health crisis and a terminal inferiority complex; their teenaged son, Quinn (Fred Hechinger), a socially awkward gamer, experiencing the wonder of nature for the very first time; their daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and her friend, Paula (Brittany O'Grady), sharp-tongued college sophomores who cast a sardonic eye on the lifestyles and belief systems of everyone around them.  The handsome, entitled Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) is here with his beautiful bride, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario).  Shane and Rachel are in the throes of young love, but as they get to know each other better in this new, intimate environment, clouds of doubt appear - and by the time Shane's intrusive mother, Kitty (Molly Shannon) surprises them with an unwelcome visit, their fairytale honeymoon has begun to unravel. And finally, there is Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy, unstable woman, recovering from the death of her mother, traveling alone to the hotel, looking for love and in desperate need of a massage."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

At stake is a large amount of money.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1033643/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"DICK STEEL"},"dateCreated":"2008-05-07","inLanguage":"English","name":"A Nutshell Review: What Happens In Vegas","reviewBody":"My only trip to the US (not counting the toddler days) where I can remember what the heck I was doing, was back in December 2005 (gee, time flies!) where I spent a total of 7 full days trawling the streets as well as the casinos up and down the Strip and its outskirts, and seriously, it's never as sexy as that portrayed in the movies (or that television series), though you'd truly never really run out of things to do, despite everything being overly expensive at tourist prices. I think I still possess a mental map of everything on the Strip!\n\nAnd of course, Vegas is famous amongst other things besides the Elvis impersonators, live entertainment etc, is the ability to conduct quicky marriages, which is what Ashton Kutcher's Jack Fuller and Cameron Diaz's Joy McNally get themselves into during a night of drunken stupor and cheap dares, two lonely souls who journey to Sin City as an escapism from their failed lives, where you can enjoy all the pleasures the city have to offer, before the drudge comes kicking in when you receive that credit card bill.\n\nSo begins the story when the duo find themselves in a situation to annul their marriage given a night of impulse that they cannot remember, but cannot do so when McNally's quarter was inserted into a jackpot machine by Fuller, and that brought them a cool 3 million dollars jackpot. Which they can't agree how to split the money, and a quirky judge sentenced them to 6 months "hard marriage" to work through their marital vows, before their frozen cash can be touched. As what the trailer had already explicitly spelt out, it's War of the Roses in Mr and Mrs Smith styled couch-therapy sessions by Queen Latifah, with comedy ranging from the slapstick, to the plain juvenile toilet tricks.\n\nAttempts to elevate the movie and give the characters more depth, come in the form of Jack Fuller learning to believe in himself and to shed his playboy, non-committal ways, and with Joy McNally having to learn to let her hair down, lighten up, and basically doing something she loves rather than to continue doing things that she dislikes, in true "live your dream" fashion. And throw in a quirky boss and ideal parents into the mix, you'd have a whole host of supporting cast to boost variety in this rather predictable tale, where you can see the outcome shining brightly like a star in a moonless night.\n\nI thought Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz could be playing themselves, i.e. one's dating an older woman, the other other no qualms in dating younger men. Well, at least their characters had never felt the need to reveal their ages, but you can tell Diaz is a spring chicken no longer since her big screen debut in The Mask. Typical of all her roles, Diaz again plays a ditzy blonde with quirky skill sets, and I thought somebody should really consider giving her a role in an action movie, since she has on display, really menacing looking biceps, and a scene where she got to show off her combo moves of a right hook and reverse roundhouse kick.\n\nKutcher on the other hand is, well, Kutcher from Punk'd, with nothing really new offered in his role of the smooth talking slacker with brooding good looks. Instead, the one who stole the show was sidekick Rob Corddry as Hater, Fuller's best friend and lawyer. He would already be familiar to some as the crazy Homeland Security agent in Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay, and I'd stick my neck out to say this is one guy to watch over the next few comedic movies, as he totally let it rip in this movie with his crazy antics.\n\nAt best, What Happens in Vegas is ideal for those itching for yet another formulaic romantic- comedy from the factories of Hollywood, or for those who missed out on the hot tickets for Speed Racer. Stay behind after the end credits roll for a final coda.

At stake is a large amount of money.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1033643/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"DICK STEEL","dateCreated":"2008-05-07","inLanguage":"English","name":"A Nutshell Review: What Happens In Vegas","reviewBody":"My only trip to the US (not counting the toddler days) where I can remember what the heck I was doing, was back in December 2005 (gee, time flies!) where I spent a total of 7 full days trawling the streets as well as the casinos up and down the Strip and its outskirts, and seriously, it's never as sexy as that portrayed in the movies (or that television series), though you'd truly never really run out of things to do, despite everything being overly expensive at tourist prices. I think I still possess a mental map of everything on the Strip!\n\nAnd of course, Vegas is famous amongst other things besides the Elvis impersonators, live entertainment etc, is the ability to conduct quicky marriages, which is what Ashton Kutcher's Jack Fuller and Cameron Diaz's Joy McNally get themselves into during a night of drunken stupor and cheap dares, two lonely souls who journey to Sin City as an escapism from their failed lives, where you can enjoy all the pleasures the city have to offer, before the drudge comes kicking in when you receive that credit card bill.\n\nSo begins the story when the duo find themselves in a situation to annul their marriage given a night of impulse that they cannot remember, but cannot do so when McNally's quarter was inserted into a jackpot machine by Fuller, and that brought them a cool 3 million dollars jackpot. Which they can't agree how to split the money, and a quirky judge sentenced them to 6 months "hard marriage" to work through their marital vows, before their frozen cash can be touched. As what the trailer had already explicitly spelt out, it's War of the Roses in Mr and Mrs Smith styled couch-therapy sessions by Queen Latifah, with comedy ranging from the slapstick, to the plain juvenile toilet tricks.\n\nAttempts to elevate the movie and give the characters more depth, come in the form of Jack Fuller learning to believe in himself and to shed his playboy, non-committal ways, and with Joy McNally having to learn to let her hair down, lighten up, and basically doing something she loves rather than to continue doing things that she dislikes, in true "live your dream" fashion. And throw in a quirky boss and ideal parents into the mix, you'd have a whole host of supporting cast to boost variety in this rather predictable tale, where you can see the outcome shining brightly like a star in a moonless night.\n\nI thought Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz could be playing themselves, i.e. one's dating an older woman, the other other no qualms in dating younger men. Well, at least their characters had never felt the need to reveal their ages, but you can tell Diaz is a spring chicken no longer since her big screen debut in The Mask. Typical of all her roles, Diaz again plays a ditzy blonde with quirky skill sets, and I thought somebody should really consider giving her a role in an action movie, since she has on display, really menacing looking biceps, and a scene where she got to show off her combo moves of a right hook and reverse roundhouse kick.\n\nKutcher on the other hand is, well, Kutcher from Punk'd, with nothing really new offered in his role of the smooth talking slacker with brooding good looks. Instead, the one who stole the show was sidekick Rob Corddry as Hater, Fuller's best friend and lawyer. He would already be familiar to some as the crazy Homeland Security agent in Harold and Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay, and I'd stick my neck out to say this is one guy to watch over the next few comedic movies, as he totally let it rip in this movie with his crazy antics.\n\nAt best, What Happens in Vegas is ideal for those itching for yet another formulaic romantic- comedy from the factories of Hollywood, or for those who missed out on the hot tickets for Speed Racer. Stay behind after the end credits roll for a final coda. There are 2 at the beginning of the end credits, but hold out right until the end before you decide to make for the exit.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":168924,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-05-07","keywords":"jackpot,wedding,drunkenness,hit in the crotch,father son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What Happens in Vegas ...

In their research, they discover how flawed and corrupt the market is.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1596363/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Zuranthium"},"dateCreated":"2015-11-15","inLanguage":"English","name":"An unexpected and necessary masterpiece","reviewBody":"Comedy is tragedy + time, right? We're now over 7 years out from the apex of the American financial crisis, which spiraled outward across the world, and yet what has really changed? People are still making millions/billions off the suffering of others, corporate control reigns supreme, fraud is common and remains largely unknown, wealth continues to be ever more concentrated in the grasp of a few, and the remainder of the populace are treated as proverbial rats and made to feel uncouth should they question the system and question not wanting to live their lives playing this sadistic game. Taking 2 pennies and selling them to someone for a hundred dollars remains a legal activity, just call those pennies by a different name and suddenly it's okay to pass them off as fair market.\n\nIt doesn't sound funny at all, but The Big Short succeeds in turning this demented and corrupt circus into something improbably hilarious and probing. The power of comedy is its ability to let us see something from a different viewpoint, allow us to process it in ways we wouldn't have been able to otherwise. As we might laugh at children for the hilariously unaware things they say and do, so too will humankind in the future hopefully laugh at how completely pathetic and ignorant our present society has been. Martin Scorsese opened the flap up into the circus entrance with "The Wolf of Wall Street" and, while making good points, was perhaps a bit too concerned with his own technique and had a bit too much indulgence, reveling in the frivolity of it all. The Big Short completely blows the top of the circus and dissects it in every way, starting with the widespread fraud and greed in business, and then examining how it has seeped into our entire existences. Even the good guys here are ultimately out there to make money, lots of it. Isn't that what society tells us we must to do, in order to be valuable? It's sick.\n\nMcKay's approach here is "throw everything in, including the kitchen sink" and that creates an energetic, brilliantly matched representation of the subject matter. This does not mean he is lacking control, however. The story being told includes so many facets and characters that it easily could have fallen into disarray, but McKay makes every single character memorable and illuminates every piece of jargon that could be confusing from the outset. It's a huge accomplishment and a far more important one than might seem apparent. The things that were allowed to happen in the realms of business, finance, and banking are absolutely INSANE and unbelievable. It has to be largely comedic because there's no other way of delivering this vast amount of information and complete failure of our entire society and make it all snap into place so continuously, without being ripped apart by the overwhelming darkness of it all. This isn't simply circumstantial and theoretical and mysterious to a degree, as in Oliver Stone's "JFK", but the cold hard truth.\n\nIt's not enough to even ask for the truth anymore and ask for answers, we need to question the entire system, a whole web of poisonous bonds that have tightly wound themselves so entirely around us. The work of the film itself is allowing us to project our thoughts, our fears, our anger, and our confusions into this convoluted conundrum. All while being told the truth, so that we at least have a place to even start down the correct path of understanding. It's acting as our own investigative journey in a time when actual news and journalism has become a tiny spec of its former self. We now have more information than ever available to us, yet it's often so shrouded and twisted as to become unrecognizable. There are still those who fear education for what it would do to their own position in life, how it would challenge their own reality. We are still held under the thumb of "greed is good", "thinking you're inherently better is good", "vanity is good".\n\nThe shiny mainstream hallmarks of a typical Hollywoood commercial product - the agreeable lighting and manicured actors and tidy locations - are so perfectly representative in this film of the emptiness within the characters and indeed in our entire society. After all the progress we think we've made towards world peace and human rights and medical advances and the stability of the human race, have we lost sight of what a fulfilling life and a world of justice should really be? Aren't we still captive to the same pointless rituals and superficialities, doesn't a veritable monarch and royal court still control most everything? We are now living our lives working for something that can be wiped out with the stroke of a keyboard. We are told something of monetary worth that is non-existent, for all intents and purposes, is something we should strive for. Making a bet on the outcome of another bet is a whole industry. The non-existent and ridiculous and pointless directly hurts the lives of many.\n\nThe Big Short is one of the most important films of this era and one of the best. I wanted to laugh and cry at the same time. It is an illumination, a magical pairing of a director's sensibility to exactly the correct form that most fully allows it to blossom and hold water. It is water which the film warns us will be the next basic human necessity to be denied by those few who hold power.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":388913,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-12-23","keywords":"mortgage,finance,bank,banking,short selling","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1593618969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI1NDY1MTY1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg1OTIzNzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI1NDY1MTY1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg1OTIzNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When four outsiders saw what the big banks, media and government refused to, the global collapse of the economy, they had an idea:  The Big Short.

I had two worries going into the film: what happens if they change it and make it awful; and, I had imagined Tamara a little older than Gemma Arterton - maybe she was not right for the part. Film makers often disappoint (the "Time Travellers wife" is a case in point where an excellent story was ruined by someone not understanding the multiple viewpoints in the book).\n\nNot sure if this was aimed at fat middle aged blokes - but it worked for me, my worries were groundless: the comedy and drama survived from the story (maybe Posy Simmonds should create more novels that can be filmed). The casting was excellent and Roger Allam gave a fantastic performance, Tamsin Greg was brilliant as usual and Gemma Arterton was a revelation in the lead role. The Drumming sequence with 'Ben' in the cottage was particularly brilliant.

I had two worries going into the film: what happens if they change it and make it awful; and, I had imagined Tamara a little older than Gemma Arterton - maybe she was not right for the part. Film makers often disappoint (the "Time Travellers wife" is a case in point where an excellent story was ruined by someone not understanding the multiple viewpoints in the book).\n\nNot sure if this was aimed at fat middle aged blokes - but it worked for me, my worries were groundless: the comedy and drama survived from the story (maybe Posy Simmonds should create more novels that can be filmed). The casting was excellent and Roger Allam gave a fantastic performance, Tamsin Greg was brilliant as usual and Gemma Arterton was a revelation in the lead role. The Drumming sequence with 'Ben' in the cottage was particularly brilliant. It was good with its 'loser' characters (and I thought, maybe they should have weekends to help civil servants write inspiring briefing for uninspiring Ministers)\n\nI am amazed at the negative reviews on the site, I do not think that that the film tried to be more than it was and yes it was set in an idyllic English village - that was the point.

You can tell he's talented and will keep growing as a performer. Cara is great like normal.\n\nSo don't listen to the overly negative reviews on here. That's just 2020 internet troll stuff. Most of these clowns on here just need something to do so they b-tch about everything. If you hate a certain type of movie, don't watch it. That's easier than watching it and then complaining about it. Me? I hate musicals. So I don't watch them and then blame the cast for me hating it.

With a stunning central performance by Gary Oldman, confident and passionate directing from Joe Wright, and a brilliant screenplay from start to finish, Darkest Hour is a simply exceptional film.\n\nWhen telling a story as well-known as that of Winston Churchill and the Second World War, being both exciting and historically accurate isn't always easy, but that's where the unique take on the historical drama of Darkest Hour comes in.\n\nYes, it does tell of the extreme intensity of the early days of the war, the political manoeuvring in Westminster as Churchill was appointed Prime Minister, and the very real and impending threat that the fall of Britain could very well mean the end of freedom-loving Western civilisation, which are all absolutely fascinating to watch unfold, but they're all parts of history that you arguably already know very well.\n\nThat's why the film's decision to bring a brilliant sense of humour and a strong passion to proceedings is so effective. The importance of the events being portrayed on screen is never downplayed, and there are indeed some very intense and emotionally powerful moments, but there's so much more to Darkest Hour than just history, something that made it such a refreshing watch compared to how most Oscar-bait biographies turn out.\n\nAbove all, what impressed me most about the film was the fact that it's just so funny. It's by no means a comedy, but this isn't a pompous and dry historical drama, but one that takes glee in pointing out the eccentricities in its main character, eccentricities which are undoubtedly a part of why Churchill is so lauded and respected to this day.\n\nWhile the film praises Churchill's bulldog spirit in fighting the fight against the Nazis, it's always keen to show him in a slightly brighter light, almost as if he was a man who stumbled into the most important job in history by coincidence. In that, there are so many genuinely hilarious scenes as Churchill's quirky personality clashes with the more uptight politicians of Westminster, a part of the film that I felt not only made everything more entertaining, but helped to give the movie an incredibly refreshing energy, allowing me to see Churchill in a very relatable, personal light rather than just as a historical figure from a textbook.\n\nAs well as being downright hilarious at points, there's a real passion behind the film's depiction of the darkest hours of the war. With Churchill being forced over to opening peace talks with Hitler, the film does an incredible job at inspiring you to a point of fever pitch, fully backing Churchill's bulldog spirit to fight and defend freedom to the very last moment, meaning that the internal conflict he suffers throughout the film is such a riveting focal point.\n\nThis is an undoubtedly patriotic film, and heaps a lot of praise onto Churchill's gusto, but that doesn't mean it's overly jingoistic. There may be a case that Brits watching the film will feel more emotion from its incredible passion, but I still feel that most of that comes from how well the character of Churchill is developed throughout, from a bumbling, mumbling, lovable old man to a truly honest and principled leader.\n\nFinally, we have to talk about Gary Oldman's performance, which is amazing. For one, thanks of course in part to the make-up and costume teams, it's pretty impossible to tell that you're watching Gary Oldman in this movie. But not only does he look nothing like Oldman, and so much more like Churchill, but everything about Oldman's performance, from the smallest details about Churchill to his fantastic passion and energy on screen, pulls you further and further into the moment, and creates an exceptionally convincing portrayal of the great man and the situation surrounding him, which I was blown away by.\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved Darkest Hour. It's an undoubtedly riveting historical drama about a crucial turning point in global history, but more than that, it's full of incredible energy from start to finish, with amazing and still appropriate humour throughout combined with stunning patriotic passion, making for a genuinely exciting and properly entertaining film that does so much more than your typical Oscar-bait fare.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":184944,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-12-22","keywords":"world war two,speech,prime minister,politics,winston churchill character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3915626777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk0OTM5MDIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2Nzk2MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk0OTM5MDIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2Nzk2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"This true story begins at the precipice of World War II as, within days of becoming Prime Minister of Great Britain, Winston Churchill (Academy Award nominee Gary Oldman) must face one of his most turbulent and defining trials: exploring a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany, or standing firm to fight for the ideals, liberty and freedom of a nation.

Writing, directing and acting are all top-notch. Many respected thespians pass through: Peter Blythe, Edward Petherbridge, Betty Marsden, Toyah Wilcox, Anne Todd - yes, that Anne Todd. Like the Simenon novels, the episodes are thick with atmosphere and explore the seedy realities of life. The characters are not nice middle class people who appreciate classical music and whose children go to good schools. They are a spendthrift playboy in a mouldy chateaux, or a stripper with - not a heart of gold but a few moments of tenderness. They are dentist's assistants, schoolboys, mendacious antique dealers, toyboys, prostitutes.  See it if you can. xxxx","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":722,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1992-02-09","keywords":"character name as series title,whodunit,red herring,detective,surname as series title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002091/","name":"Michael Gambon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404232/","name":"Geoffrey Hutchings","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0303177/","name":"Jack Galloway"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103289/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is when the series starts to pick up steam. Watching the show, you can't help but laugh at Briscoe's remarks or feel the passion of McCoy. Both of these men want justice, and will do everything within limits to bring the wrongdoers to justice. What I really like about the show is the wonderful twists and turns that they throw to the audience, as well as the "ripped from the headlines" episodes.

Writing, directing and acting are all top-notch. Many respected thespians pass through: Peter Blythe, Edward Petherbridge, Betty Marsden, Toyah Wilcox, Anne Todd - yes, that Anne Todd. Like the Simenon novels, the episodes are thick with atmosphere and explore the seedy realities of life. The characters are not nice middle class people who appreciate classical music and whose children go to good schools. They are a spendthrift playboy in a mouldy chateaux, or a stripper with - not a heart of gold but a few moments of tenderness. They are dentist's assistants, schoolboys, mendacious antique dealers, toyboys, prostitutes.

In fact all that reviews kept me from seeing The Shield for a long time.\n\nBut now that i am through with all Lost and 24 Seasons, seen The Wire twice, had a good time with Oz it was time for something new, so i finally gave The Shield a chance.\n\nAnd i can tell you it's one hell of a ride, i was hooked after seeing the first episode. I would even compare the series to The Wire, it is different of course and doesn't focus so much on the social aspects, it goes more for the action.\n\nIt's got all you need, corrupt cops, drugs, violence, betrayal, good detective work (homicide team) and even some hot chicks occasionally ;) So my conclusion is that if you like quality series with a persistent plot and cliffhangers like The Wire, Lost, Sopranos or Oz go for this one you won't regret it! It will keep you on the edge of your seat for a long time.\n\nAnd i really can't understand where all those bad reviews are coming from... go check The Shield out for yourself!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75913,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-12","keywords":"corrupt cop,los angeles california,made for cable tv,mayor,drugs","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004821/","name":"Michael Chiklis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413052/","name":"Michael Jace","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439813/","name":"Jay Karnes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086397/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0203234/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0752841/","name":"Shawn Ryan"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Shield: Season Seven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi425591577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NjYxNjgtYmIzYy00ZmUzLTllNjMtMzA3MDMwMDAxZmQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI1NjYxNjgtYmIzYy00ZmUzLTllNjMtMzA3MDMwMDAxZmQwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home video trailer for the final season of this cop show"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Rating : above average, 7/10 for the accuracy in depicting the XVI century city , as the money are not waste, though not for too squeamish watchers due to its sour seeing of poorness, sleazy events, nudism , heinous killings and extreme realism .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1857,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-12","keywords":"plague,murder investigation,death,violence,blood","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1944825/","name":"Pablo Molinero","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3802082/","name":"Patricia López Arnaiz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1525783/","name":"Sergio Castellanos"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0296182/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0544623/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1943791/","name":"Rafael Cobos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735705/","name":"Alberto Rodríguez"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm so glad I stuck it out...Gabriel Byrne...I first admired him years ago when he played in a robust movie called "Into The West" which I now own on DVD. He is one damn fine actor in a tour de force of a show that he can easily sink his teeth into. \n\nDiane Wiest as the therapist's therapist is noteworthy as well!\n\nThe plot is addictive...I quickly became committed to the weekly patients, some of whom I really hate. The script is detailed, intense and very well written. The simple sets and the subtle camera action during emotional moments, serves well to keep one purely focused on the drama. And man what drama! Even though it has no comedy, In Treatment is almost destined to be another big hit for HBO.\n\nSome one suggested Robin Williams should have had the part of the psychoanalyst...what? I hope that was a joke.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16620,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-01-28","keywords":"therapist,based on israeli tv series,home office,treatment,therapist client relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000321/","name":"Gabriel Byrne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2499064/","name":"Uzo Aduba","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001848/","name":"Dianne Wiest"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073996/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0198598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092329/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006554/","name":"Rodrigo García","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505448/","name":"Hagai Levi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0074844/","name":"Nir Bergman"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi987152409","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjI1Y2FkNzktMjNkNC00NzNlLTg3MjktYjUzZDNlYTkzZGFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjI1Y2FkNzktMjNkNC00NzNlLTg3MjktYjUzZDNlYTkzZGFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"The HBO original series is back in session.

It got boring during the middle seasons, but season 6 was very good. I have mixed emotions about season 7. They provided a lot of interesting back story for a few characters, but they left a lot of loose threads at the end.\n\nThe whole series showed way too much of Ray's daughter. She got somewhat interesting in Season 6, but then I, once again, lost interest in her during season 7.\n\nI'm glad Ray's son wasn't shown much during the last few seasons. He was an annoying character from the beginning.\n\nOverall, it's a good show if you can stick with the boring bits.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-06-18","keywords":"female investigator,nudity,fixer,fbi agent,brother sister relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000630/","name":"Liev Schreiber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0550371/","name":"Eddie Marsan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005231/","name":"Dash Mihok"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093837/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0081189/","name":"Ann Biderman"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 7 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2778578713","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVhY2M3OGYtYjRjOS00MmFjLWFlNTItOWFlOThlMmZjOTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVhY2M3OGYtYjRjOS00MmFjLWFlNTItOWFlOThlMmZjOTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"While Ray makes personal progress, there are dangers that require the Ray Donovan of old.

However when the British burn his home and heartlessly kill one of his young sons, Martin knows he must take a stand and enters the conflict. With great personal sacrifice he joins the bloody conflict for freedom and honour and the love of his country.\n\nIn his episode of The Simpsons, Mel Gibson starred in a remake of Mr Smith Goes to Washington except Homer helped him to change it into a film that was closer to Lethal Weapon than the James Stewart original. That was a joke, but having just watched Mel Gibson turn the American Civil War into a sort of revenge action movie I considered that perhaps Homer had a hand in this one too and that the joke was on us for spending three hours watching it. It starts out with a bit of moral chat about the importance of peace etc but one dead son later and Benjamin Martin has become a one-man war machine, wiping out 20 British soldiers in a blink of an eye. It is the start of a morally simplistic film that offers little for those looking for a historical piece. In fairness the film never actually aims to be anything other than a modern action movie in a historical setting but having low ambitious doesn't mean it can't be criticised for being crap  because that is just what it is.\n\nSo we have the pantomime villains of the English killing women and children while the good wholesome American people (most of whom employ blacks to pick cotton rather than use slaves) try to do the right thing but are drawn into a bloody fight for freedom and justice. It is as simplistic as it sounds and every time Emmerich fears that his audience are losing touch with who the bad guys are, he'll have them burn kill a load of women with gleeful glints in their eyes. It gets tiresome very quickly and the fact that it is three hours long (give or take  I'd prefer to take) just makes it worse. Visually it looks as good as you would expect a big budget production to do but substance-wise it is just nonsense, with overblown (if impressive) battle sequences which laughably include lots of John Woo style use of guns, slow-mo and catching weapons in mid-air before using them. The bits in between the action are no better as they are merely twists of an emotional knife that the writer must have hoped would make us overlook how simplified everything is; I was waiting for the scene where Col Tavington drowned kittens in a sack to demonstrate how evil he was. No, this is not a film to come to for debate because as far as Rodat is concerned, that is all done and dusted in the early stages and then completely dismissed as nonsense by the next 160 minutes of film. I'm not going to even get into the historical liberties taken because even ignoring them this is still a terrible load of rubbish.\n\nOnce the film gets going, Mel Gibson only does a couple of things: he is either cocky (like Riggs), brave (like Braveheart) or full of indignation and swelling pride in his country. He flicks between these like someone was turning a switch in his back; he is never consistent and he is never a real person  in fact he is never anyone other than Mel Gibson. Heath Ledger gives a simplistic performance but with no material to work with, what could he do? I don't know why Richardson bothered to show up although I can appreciate that Karyo and Wilkinson have mortgages to pay just like the rest of us. I don't give the same excuse to Cooper because he always struck me as an intelligent actor who makes good decisions  he is really too good to be earning his money from this. The support all do what they are told but I don't want to be too hard on the majority of the cast simply because the material is not there and nobody can do good work with characters that would seem underdeveloped on children's television.\n\nOverall this is a good looking and noisy action movie and as such it might just please audiences that like lots of things blowing up and Americans being the good guys. However for the majority of viewers the simplistic material, stomach-churning flag-waving, emotional exploitation and dumb action movie clichés. It is nonsense from start to finish in my opinion and it is not worth 90 minutes, far less 170."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262306,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2000-07-19","keywords":"american revolution,hero,standoff,father son relationship,george washington character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Patriot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi100139289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcxNjY2N2MtNjllYy00OGE1LTgxMmYtZjYwOTc2MzEyYzVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcxNjY2N2MtNjllYy00OGE1LTgxMmYtZjYwOTc2MzEyYzVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Touchstone Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005132/","name":"Heath Ledger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000613/","name":"Joely Richardson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007500/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But know know what? This was actually a good remake.\n\nWhile the movie is very similar to the original, they did make some small changes here and there, mainly in the characters background and their motivation - which might help explain some things that seemed a bit odd in the original (for example, why would a beautiful blonde marry a geek). Others may claim the writer ruined some ideas.\n\nIt's hard and unfair to compare the actors' performance to Dustin Hoffman and David Warner in the original, but I have to say that all the cast actually did a decent job.

This was actually a good remake.\n\nWhile the movie is very similar to the original, they did make some small changes here and there, mainly in the characters background and their motivation - which might help explain some things that seemed a bit odd in the original (for example, why would a beautiful blonde marry a geek). Others may claim the writer ruined some ideas.\n\nIt's hard and unfair to compare the actors' performance to Dustin Hoffman and David Warner in the original, but I have to say that all the cast actually did a decent job. James Woods was excellent as a southern redneck and Kate Bosworth was surprisingly good too. I'm not familiar with any of the other actors, who were all decent in their roles.\n\nThe ending had some small changes too - again, made in order for the characters to have a better motivation.

The film features a relatively simple but clever premise: Superhottie Kylie Travis stars as Karen Warren, a police negotiator who's on vacation in Texas. She gets into a car accident and has to hitchhike with a somewhat odd, but seemingly friendly couple, Frank and Rayanne (James Belushi and Shannon Whirry). \n\nBut everything goes horribly wrong when Frank discovers Rayanne has been cheating on him and he murders her right in front of Karen's eyes, who proceeds to run to the nearest building, a government-owned complex run by a single occupant, a scientist named Brian (Frank Whaley). There, he accidentally activates the time travel device he was working on, sending Karen back twenty minutes, just as she's been picked up by Frank. She then becomes determined to stop the horrible crime for occurring, but unfortunately, the body count grows even larger and she must go back again to prevent an even larger massacre.\n\nRetroactive's appeal holds mainly to sci-fi action fans. The plot has a lot of twists and turns, which keeps the film unpredictable and suspenseful. But the real treat is for action fans, who should strap in for an adrenaline-pumping thrill ride. From the moment Travis is sent back in time, the film deliver non-stop excitement. There are tense shootouts and fast-paced car chases, the latter of which boasts some of the most exhilarating stunts since The Road Warrior. From a visceral point-of-view, Retroactive surpasses most of Hollywood's recent summer blockbusters. \n\nThe film still has its flaws, none of them surprisingly having to do with a sense of repetition, considering each action setpiece has the same basic setting and situation (car chase on a lonely desert highway, shootout at a gas station). Credit director Louis Morneau for keeping each sequence fresh and taut with suspense. The set-up may be the same, but the results and resolutions considerably differ. Rather, what I do have a problem with is some technical error during the shootouts. Belushi is shown firing a six-bullet revolver at one point, but clearly fires more than ten rounds. Another similar blatant miscalculation occurs again near the end. Plot holes and leaps of logic are expected in this kind of film, but the number of shots fired from a gun shouldn't be that hard to keep track of.\n\nAs the film's tough heroine, the absolutely gorgeous Kylie Travis is refreshingly intelligent and strong-willed. She occasionally has trouble holding back that British accent of hers, but still comes across quite well (looks great in that black tank-top, too). James Belushi is a lot of fun as the psychotic villain, clearly relishing the over-the-top role, even though his character does lose menace through some ridiculous one-liners. Frank Whaley is quite good as the young scientist, hampered only by a single scene that requires him to forget the logic of his own device which Travis corrects him on.\n\nWith blistering, fast-paced action and a fun story, Retroactive proves to be a highly enjoyable way to spend ninety minutes. Most of the running time features a tight tank-top and pants wearing Kylie Travis kicking ass, so that alone is enough to recommend the film."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6028,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1997-01-01","keywords":"time travel,alternate timeline,crime of passion,race against time,rampage","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000902/","name":"Jim Belushi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0871406/","name":"Kylie Travis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0924204/","name":"Shannon Whirry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007128/","name":"Louis Morneau"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001995/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010022/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358228/","name":"Michael Hamilton-Wright"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0833866/","name":"Robert Strauss"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046093/","name":"Phillip Badger"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It had me wanting to watch all the way until the end.  It was about 30 minutes too long I'm afraid though.  There were many times that I thought there were scenes that could have been cut and still made this movie funny and with great action.  Some of the parts were a little overacted as well.

The acting is great, especially Rosanna Arquette's performance, and the story is not cheesy at all--it's actually compelling. The (sparse) fight sequences don't involve any weird Van Damme midair split-kicks to the head; they're straight-ahead brawls.

I was shocked when it turned out to be truly well done, and not just for a Van Damme movie. The acting is great, especially Rosanna Arquette's performance, and the story is not cheesy at all--it's actually compelling. The (sparse) fight sequences don't involve any weird Van Damme midair split-kicks to the head; they're straight-ahead brawls.

The film features a relatively simple but clever premise: Superhottie Kylie Travis stars as Karen Warren, a police negotiator who's on vacation in Texas. She gets into a car accident and has to hitchhike with a somewhat odd, but seemingly friendly couple, Frank and Rayanne (James Belushi and Shannon Whirry). \n\nBut everything goes horribly wrong when Frank discovers Rayanne has been cheating on him and he murders her right in front of Karen's eyes, who proceeds to run to the nearest building, a government-owned complex run by a single occupant, a scientist named Brian (Frank Whaley). There, he accidentally activates the time travel device he was working on, sending Karen back twenty minutes, just as she's been picked up by Frank. She then becomes determined to stop the horrible crime for occurring, but unfortunately, the body count grows even larger and she must go back again to prevent an even larger massacre.\n\nRetroactive's appeal holds mainly to sci-fi action fans. The plot has a lot of twists and turns, which keeps the film unpredictable and suspenseful. But the real treat is for action fans, who should strap in for an adrenaline-pumping thrill ride. From the moment Travis is sent back in time, the film deliver non-stop excitement. There are tense shootouts and fast-paced car chases, the latter of which boasts some of the most exhilarating stunts since The Road Warrior. From a visceral point-of-view, Retroactive surpasses most of Hollywood's recent summer blockbusters. \n\nThe film still has its flaws, none of them surprisingly having to do with a sense of repetition, considering each action setpiece has the same basic setting and situation (car chase on a lonely desert highway, shootout at a gas station). Credit director Louis Morneau for keeping each sequence fresh and taut with suspense. The set-up may be the same, but the results and resolutions considerably differ. Rather, what I do have a problem with is some technical error during the shootouts. Belushi is shown firing a six-bullet revolver at one point, but clearly fires more than ten rounds. Another similar blatant miscalculation occurs again near the end. Plot holes and leaps of logic are expected in this kind of film, but the number of shots fired from a gun shouldn't be that hard to keep track of.\n\nAs the film's tough heroine, the absolutely gorgeous Kylie Travis is refreshingly intelligent and strong-willed. She occasionally has trouble holding back that British accent of hers, but still comes across quite well (looks great in that black tank-top, too). James Belushi is a lot of fun as the psychotic villain, clearly relishing the over-the-top role, even though his character does lose menace through some ridiculous one-liners. Frank Whaley is quite good as the young scientist, hampered only by a single scene that requires him to forget the logic of his own device which Travis corrects him on.\n\nWith blistering, fast-paced action and a fun story, Retroactive proves to be a highly enjoyable way to spend ninety minutes. Most of the running time features a tight tank-top and pants wearing Kylie Travis kicking ass, so that alone is enough to recommend the film."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6028,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1997-01-01","keywords":"time travel,alternate timeline,crime of passion,race against time,rampage","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000902/","name":"Jim Belushi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0871406/","name":"Kylie Travis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0924204/","name":"Shannon Whirry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007128/","name":"Louis Morneau"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001995/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010022/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358228/","name":"Michael Hamilton-Wright"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0833866/","name":"Robert Strauss"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046093/","name":"Phillip Badger"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Chuck, as always, fares much better when kicking ass than when simply acting, but he still makes for a formidable hero. And the snarling Yamashita is a worthy bad guy.

I was shocked when it turned out to be truly well done, and not just for a Van Damme movie. The acting is great, especially Rosanna Arquette's performance, and the story is not cheesy at all--it's actually compelling.

"The Last Face" premiered during Cannes last year and it got bashed by critics and even booed at. When I heard about that I couldn't really believe it. I mean, a film directed by Sean Penn starring Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem being that bad? It got me curious to watch it. Because I needed to know if it was getting fair reviews or not. It turned out to be a long wait, because It took a year for it to finally come out in other countries. I went in with an open mind. Ready to give it a deserving chance like every movie does.

But it does get messy.\n\nWhat I didn't like was that it got exaggerated and tried to force the emotion rather then earning it. The romance was predictable and typical. It goes through all the expected beats of "Will they be together or won't they?" The movie uses narration and I thought it was unnecessary. It would have worked better without filling the audience in on the plot so often. I think people can figure it out perfectly well on their own, because it just added to the melodrama. Which was annoying at times with them over sympathizing the story and dragging out moments. It was good whenever it just calmed down and showed some realism. The premise itself is fine. Doctors going to Africa to help people in need. I understood the overall message of mankind's goodwill. The hospital/doctor scenes had some tension to them and they felt very realistic. There's also a lot of gruesome and horrific imagery of people's misfortune in Africa which was affecting. Those were the parts that stuck with me. The characters were able to convince me in many scenes, but unfortunately not the entire way through. It's sad, because Bardem and Theron looks to have put so much effort into this.\n\nLike I said, the story of them being doctors and traveling in Africa to help people was fine. It was the romantic story that dragged on and felt clichéd. They should have toned it down and made the entire movie more realistic and down to earth. I was able to see glimmers of what could have been really good touching moments. Instead we get too much melodrama with musical soundtrack telling you exactly how to feel instead of the story itself making you feel something. Although there was some music I liked in it: The local African songs and the Piano tracks towards the end. There are scenes that are good. Scenes that feel like real life stories with heart to them. The thing is that we get so few of them spread across the movie. I was never able to truly appreciate those scenes so well because the following part would often drag it down again.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the final moments were finally able to get some emotion across. The ending was my favorite part. It made me finally care for what was going. It was a little too late. But hey, at least it was something. The movie leaves you reflecting on life a little bit. But not nearly as much as I'm sure the filmmakers wanted. It does, however have its moments that work. And for that I will give it points. The movie is not nearly as awful as some people are making it out to be. It's just average. If you are looking for something to pass the time with, then this will work fine. Just don't expect much. It's watchable, but nothing memorable.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4818,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"2017-07-28","keywords":"female nudity,monrovia libria,three word title,orchestra,paraguay","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Last Face","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1512749337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0N2JjOTMtNmZiMC00NzA0LTg1ZGItZmU2YmNkMWE2MzE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0N2JjOTMtNmZiMC00NzA0LTg1ZGItZmU2YmNkMWE2MzE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Last Face"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000234/","name":"Charlize Theron"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000849/","name":"Javier Bardem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9552585/","name":"Brandon Phillips"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0120121/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0318062/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062831/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0226586/","name":"Erin Dignam"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"The Last Face" premiered during Cannes last year and it got bashed by critics and even booed at. When I heard about that I couldn't really believe it. I mean, a film directed by Sean Penn starring Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem being that bad? It got me curious to watch it. Because I needed to know if it was getting fair reviews or not. It turned out to be a long wait, because It took a year for it to finally come out in other countries. I went in with an open mind. Ready to give it a deserving chance like every movie does.

I have to admit it, I'm a girl, I totally fell in love with this movie. But I'm one of the rare girls that loves baseball with a passion, I was raised in a very baseball oriented family, we live in Chicago, we kinda have to enjoy sports, lol. But growing up you wonder why baseball, football, basketball are more for the boys vs. the girls, girls can play but are not famous for it and if they are an athlete are accused of being manly. It's a tough world, but when I was 7 years old A League of their Own was released in theaters, my family saw this movie together and my life changed. Sounds silly, but this was the movie that reminded me to stay strong, at the time when women were expected to stay in the kitchen, as hard as they had to work for it, there was a women's baseball league during WWII. A League of their Own explores this hard but extremely fun time for the girls of the All American Baseball League.\n\nWhen World War II threatens to shut down Major League Baseball, candy manufacturing magnate Walter Harvey decides to create a women's league to make money. Ira Lowenstein is put in charge of public relations and scout Ernie Capadino is sent out to recruit players. Capadino likes what he sees in catcher Dottie Hinson. She's a terrific hitter and he offers her a tryout, but the married woman is content where she is, working in a dairy and on the family farm in Oregon while her husband is away at war. He's less impressed with her younger sister, pitcher Kit Keller, who loves the game passionately but appears to be less talented. He finally lets her come along when she persuades Dottie to give it a try for her sake. When the trio arrive at the tryouts in Chicago, they meet Doris and Mae. They make it onto the team, The Peaches who are managed by drunkard former baseball great Jimmy Dugan. Jimmy initially treats the whole thing as a joke, leaving the managerial duties to Dottie. However, he takes over when he sees how hard and well his team plays. The league attracts little interest at first. With a Life magazine photographer in attendance, he asks them to do something spectacular. When a ball is popped up behind home plate, she catches it while doing splits; the resulting photograph makes the cover of the magazine. More and more people show up and the league becomes a huge success.\n\nThe acting is absolutely superb, we have actors on top of their game, Tom Hanks who delivers the memorable "There's no crying in baseball!" speech. Geena Davis who was a great heroine as the star of the league who just wants her husband home from the war but is hanging onto the league for her little sister's sake. Even Madonna and Rosie O'Donnell are great together and have awesome chemistry as best friends Mae and Doris. This is one of those chick flicks that everyone has to see because it worked on every level. Penny Marshall truly brought out the pain these girls had to go through to be taken seriously. The ending always gets me in tears I have to admit, just knowing that these girls hung in there and stayed strong when everyone told them that girls couldn't play ball, let's hope that one day they'll have the opportunity again.\n\n10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98905,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1992-07-01","keywords":"baseball,sports team,women's sports,friendship between women,baseball movie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A League of Their Own","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1872936473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlYTQ0YTctOGNlNC00MGE1LThiYjktNjVjNDNlZDk4Yzg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlYTQ0YTctOGNlNC00MGE1LThiYjktNjVjNDNlZDk4Yzg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000133/","name":"Geena Davis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001614/","name":"Lori Petty"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001508/","name":"Penny Marshall"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063736/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933718/","name":"Kim Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0133676/","name":"Kelly Candaele"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0304665/","name":"Lowell Ganz"}],"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I thought I'd get something suitable for an octogenarian lady who likes "nice" films with pretty people in them.\n\nWell, it turned out she'd seen it, and anyway she and my wife were off to a show at 8pm, so I'd have to watch it all by myself (a one night rental, you see).\n\nWe have a home theater set up with high quality HD projection and a large 12 foot screen... perfect for expansive Blu Ray vistas. I thought I'd get at least some Academy Award nominated eye candy out of Australia, if nothing else. Not being a big Kidman or Jackman fan, I was hoping some of the supporting roles would hold my attention.\n\nI was glad I could watch Australia alone, as it made my laughing out loud and the tears rolling down my face (sometimes simultaneously) less embarrassing.\n\nThis is a wonderful, sprawling, completely overdone, yet breathtakingly entertaining movie. I'm not interested in where it fits into the Baz Lurhmann body of work. I watched Australia for itself, as a one off experience... and the film delivers a cornucopia of cinema treats.\n\nBe warned: to enjoy Australia you have to suspend disbelief. That is a given. Don't look for a sensitive, subtle, academic treatment of the plight of the Aboriginal Stolen Generations, redolent with citations, statistics and sober commentary. This film presents the situation crystallized around the story of one little boy, as a representative of the thousands who were removed from their mothers and fathers, destined for lives as domestic servants in white homes or as cheap workers on white cattle stations in the Northern Territory.\n\nLikewise, the depiction of the mystical Aboriginal holy man is not meant to be taken literally. To my mind, the director's intent was to bypass stuffy academia and get to the soul of the Aboriginal person's ties to the land, which after all go back tens of thousands of years. There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur. The same could be said of any of a thousand successful movies: the Lord Of The Rings Trilogy, even Ghostbusters. They assume from the start that their viewers will willing to suspend disbelief. This film requires that too.\n\nOnce your disbelief is checked at the door, you can sit back and indulge yourself in Australia. It is a film about emotion, not a documentary. It's whether the emotional truth of the film, often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve, can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.\n\nOther reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end. I join those ranks, and proudly. There is hardly a moment when the action - emotional or actual - is not hitting you right between the eyes, be it the stunning vistas or the awful badness of the baddies, the tender first kiss between the Drover and Lady Sarah, or the razor's edge existence of the young "creamie" boy, Nullah, always on the run from the well-meaning but misguided authorities who would "breed the Aboriginal out of him".\n\nSure, there are some CGI sections that at first seem way over the top, even comic book-like in their execution. But I'm not sure these weren't intentional. I wonder whether they were deliberately done they way they were to reinforce the magical and mystical thrust of the story? Yes, in Australia there are elements and style quotations from scores of previous movies. It pays homage to Indiana Jones (all four of them), Out Of Africa, Star Wars, any of the great westerns, The African Queen, Pearl Harbour (yes, Darwin really was bombed by the Japanese just after Pearl Harbour, with great loss of life), even The Wizard Of Oz. The latter was used as a metaphor for the boy's journey from grim reality to a mystical land full of evil characters, good fairies and magic animals. When he finally gets to see the movie itself, I'll guarantee even the most hardened eye in the audience will be struggling to hold back a tear.\n\nThe music was an eclectic collage of emotional cues, from the original score, thru the Hollywood musical and on to Elgar's Variations, with jazz, swing and bobbysoxer dance themes in between. Why not? The visuals and the sound reinforced each other, reaching not for footnotable, citable truth but for emotional truth (which is what all good films have ever done).\n\nThis was a great film, completely contrary to my preconceived notions of what it would be like to watch. It receives from me just about the greatest accolade I can offer any move: it's one I know I will watch over and over again, and get more out of with every viewing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Buck is an extremely likeable protagonist who goes on a compelling journey of self discovery. Despite being a dog and not having a word of dialogue, Buck is an incredibly interesting, three dimensional character with a well developed arc. The CGI used to bring him to life is amazing. While it doesn't always look natural, Buck's CGI model is so expressive and can cause the viewer to experience a variety of different emotions, despite not even being there. Harrison Ford also does well as the elderly, depressed John Thornton, carrying a great deal of tragedy and mystery about his past throughout the movie. The movie also features stunning cinematography, with several beautiful shots and camera angles. It's a true joy to look at. However, there are a few problems with the movie. For starters, John Thornton narrates a lot throughout the movie, despite not being present for, and therefore having no way of knowing about, the events that he's describing. Another issue is Dan Stevens' character; Hal. Hal is an entirely unnecessary, one dimensional antagonist, who just doesn't work with the story this movie is trying to tell. His presence also completely derails John Thornton's resolution. However, despite these problems, I still recommend The Call Of The Wild.

"The Last Face" premiered during Cannes last year and it got bashed by critics and even booed at. When I heard about that I couldn't really believe it. I mean, a film directed by Sean Penn starring Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem being that bad? It got me curious to watch it. Because I needed to know if it was getting fair reviews or not. It turned out to be a long wait, because It took a year for it to finally come out in other countries. I went in with an open mind. Ready to give it a deserving chance like every movie does. Well, now after seeing it I understand where the problems lied. Although, I must say right off the bat that it's not completely terrible... But it does get messy.\n\nWhat I didn't like was that it got exaggerated and tried to force the emotion rather then earning it. The romance was predictable and typical. It goes through all the expected beats of "Will they be together or won't they?" The movie uses narration and I thought it was unnecessary. It would have worked better without filling the audience in on the plot so often. I think people can figure it out perfectly well on their own, because it just added to the melodrama. Which was annoying at times with them over sympathizing the story and dragging out moments. It was good whenever it just calmed down and showed some realism. The premise itself is fine. Doctors going to Africa to help people in need. I understood the overall message of mankind's goodwill. The hospital/doctor scenes had some tension to them and they felt very realistic. There's also a lot of gruesome and horrific imagery of people's misfortune in Africa which was affecting. Those were the parts that stuck with me. The characters were able to convince me in many scenes, but unfortunately not the entire way through. It's sad, because Bardem and Theron looks to have put so much effort into this.\n\nLike I said, the story of them being doctors and traveling in Africa to help people was fine. It was the romantic story that dragged on and felt clichéd. They should have toned it down and made the entire movie more realistic and down to earth. I was able to see glimmers of what could have been really good touching moments. Instead we get too much melodrama with musical soundtrack telling you exactly how to feel instead of the story itself making you feel something. Although there was some music I liked in it: The local African songs and the Piano tracks towards the end. There are scenes that are good. Scenes that feel like real life stories with heart to them. The thing is that we get so few of them spread across the movie. I was never able to truly appreciate those scenes so well because the following part would often drag it down again.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the final moments were finally able to get some emotion across. The ending was my favorite part. It made me finally care for what was going. It was a little too late. But hey, at least it was something. The movie leaves you reflecting on life a little bit. But not nearly as much as I'm sure the filmmakers wanted. It does, however have its moments that work. And for that I will give it points. The movie is not nearly as awful as some people are making it out to be. It's just average. If you are looking for something to pass the time with, then this will work fine. Just don't expect much. It's watchable, but nothing memorable.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4818,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"2017-07-28","keywords":"female nudity,monrovia libria,three word title,orchestra,paraguay","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Last Face","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1512749337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0N2JjOTMtNmZiMC00NzA0LTg1ZGItZmU2YmNkMWE2MzE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0N2JjOTMtNmZiMC00NzA0LTg1ZGItZmU2YmNkMWE2MzE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Last Face"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000234/","name":"Charlize Theron"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000849/","name":"Javier Bardem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9552585/","name":"Brandon Phillips"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0120121/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0318062/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062831/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0226586/","name":"Erin Dignam"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It would have worked better without filling the audience in on the plot so often. I think people can figure it out perfectly well on their own, because it just added to the melodrama. Which was annoying at times with them over sympathizing the story and dragging out moments. It was good whenever it just calmed down and showed some realism. The premise itself is fine. Doctors going to Africa to help people in need. I understood the overall message of mankind's goodwill. The hospital/doctor scenes had some tension to them and they felt very realistic. There's also a lot of gruesome and horrific imagery of people's misfortune in Africa which was affecting. Those were the parts that stuck with me. The characters were able to convince me in many scenes, but unfortunately not the entire way through. It's sad, because Bardem and Theron looks to have put so much effort into this.\n\nLike I said, the story of them being doctors and traveling in Africa to help people was fine. It was the romantic story that dragged on and felt clichéd. They should have toned it down and made the entire movie more realistic and down to earth. I was able to see glimmers of what could have been really good touching moments. Instead we get too much melodrama with musical soundtrack telling you exactly how to feel instead of the story itself making you feel something. Although there was some music I liked in it: The local African songs and the Piano tracks towards the end. There are scenes that are good. Scenes that feel like real life stories with heart to them. The thing is that we get so few of them spread across the movie. I was never able to truly appreciate those scenes so well because the following part would often drag it down again.\n\nWithout spoiling anything, the final moments were finally able to get some emotion across. The ending was my favorite part. It made me finally care for what was going. It was a little too late. But hey, at least it was something. The movie leaves you reflecting on life a little bit. But not nearly as much as I'm sure the filmmakers wanted. It does, however have its moments that work. And for that I will give it points. The movie is not nearly as awful as some people are making it out to be. It's just average. If you are looking for something to pass the time with, then this will work fine. Just don't expect much. It's watchable, but nothing memorable.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4818,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"2017-07-28","keywords":"female nudity,monrovia libria,three word title,orchestra,paraguay","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Last Face","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1512749337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0N2JjOTMtNmZiMC00NzA0LTg1ZGItZmU2YmNkMWE2MzE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY0N2JjOTMtNmZiMC00NzA0LTg1ZGItZmU2YmNkMWE2MzE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Last Face","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000234/","name":"Charlize Theron","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000849/","name":"Javier Bardem","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9552585/","name":"Brandon Phillips"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0120121/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0318062/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062831/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0226586/","name":"Erin Dignam"],"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Buck is an extremely likeable protagonist who goes on a compelling journey of self discovery. Despite being a dog and not having a word of dialogue, Buck is an incredibly interesting, three dimensional character with a well developed arc. The CGI used to bring him to life is amazing. While it doesn't always look natural, Buck's CGI model is so expressive and can cause the viewer to experience a variety of different emotions, despite not even being there. Harrison Ford also does well as the elderly, depressed John Thornton, carrying a great deal of tragedy and mystery about his past throughout the movie. The movie also features stunning cinematography, with several beautiful shots and camera angles. It's a true joy to look at. However, there are a few problems with the movie. For starters, John Thornton narrates a lot throughout the movie, despite not being present for, and therefore having no way of knowing about, the events that he's describing. Another issue is Dan Stevens' character; Hal. Hal is an entirely unnecessary, one dimensional antagonist, who just doesn't work with the story this movie is trying to tell. His presence also completely derails John Thornton's resolution. However, despite these problems, I still recommend The Call Of The Wild.

Buck is an extremely likeable protagonist who goes on a compelling journey of self discovery. Despite being a dog and not having a word of dialogue, Buck is an incredibly interesting, three dimensional character with a well developed arc. The CGI used to bring him to life is amazing. While it doesn't always look natural, Buck's CGI model is so expressive and can cause the viewer to experience a variety of different emotions, despite not even being there. Harrison Ford also does well as the elderly, depressed John Thornton, carrying a great deal of tragedy and mystery about his past throughout the movie. The movie also features stunning cinematography, with several beautiful shots and camera angles. It's a true joy to look at. However, there are a few problems with the movie. For starters, John Thornton narrates a lot throughout the movie, despite not being present for, and therefore having no way of knowing about, the events that he's describing. Another issue is Dan Stevens' character; Hal. Hal is an entirely unnecessary, one dimensional antagonist, who just doesn't work with the story this movie is trying to tell. His presence also completely derails John Thornton's resolution. However, despite these problems, I still recommend The Call Of The Wild.

But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.\n\nWhile I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Misérables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.\n\nThere's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Misérables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.\n\nFirst, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.\n\nNext, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.\n\nHooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.\n\nThe pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.\n\nIn that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.\n\nCats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.\n\nThat story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.\n\nA little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.\n\nFrancesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.\n\nThere's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.\n\nAs a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.\n\nSo, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.\n\nIn short, Cats is an absolute atrocity. From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.\n\nThere's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":46283,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-12-20","keywords":"elderly people,worst picture razzie winner,dancing,uncanny valley,singing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2898837273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179479/","name":"James Corden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3716653/","name":"Jason Derulo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346224/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355822/","name":"Lee Hall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515908/","name":"Andrew Lloyd Webber"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Les Misérables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.\n\nFirst, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.\n\nNext, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.\n\nHooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.\n\nThe pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.\n\nIn that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.\n\nCats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.\n\nThat story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.\n\nA little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.\n\nFrancesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.\n\nThere's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.\n\nAs a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.\n\nSo, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.\n\nIn short, Cats is an absolute atrocity. From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.\n\nThere's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":46283,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-12-20","keywords":"elderly people,worst picture razzie winner,dancing,uncanny valley,singing","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2898837273","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179479/","name":"James Corden","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3716653/","name":"Jason Derulo"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346224/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355822/","name":"Lee Hall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515908/","name":"Andrew Lloyd Webber"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The ending always gets me in tears I have to admit, just knowing that these girls hung in there and stayed strong when everyone told them that girls couldn't play ball, let's hope that one day they'll have the opportunity again.\n\n10/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98905,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1992-07-01","keywords":"baseball,sports team,women's sports,friendship between women,baseball movie","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A League of Their Own","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1872936473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlYTQ0YTctOGNlNC00MGE1LThiYjktNjVjNDNlZDk4Yzg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlYTQ0YTctOGNlNC00MGE1LThiYjktNjVjNDNlZDk4Yzg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000133/","name":"Geena Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001614/","name":"Lori Petty"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001508/","name":"Penny Marshall"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063736/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933718/","name":"Kim Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0133676/","name":"Kelly Candaele","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0304665/","name":"Lowell Ganz"],"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.\n\nWe first see Richard (played by Paul Walter Hauser in one of the year's best performances) as a supply clerk at a law firm in 1986. His awkward ways and surprising efficiency catches the eye of attorney Watson Bryant (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell), a quasi-connection that comes into play a decade later. We then jump ahead those 10 years to find Richard being fired from his campus security job at a college due to his over-zealous focus on protocol. Fortunately for Richard, the Olympics are coming to Atlanta, so finding work as a security guard is pretty easy.\n\nAtlanta's Centennial Olympic Park is shown with crowds of people cheering at a Kenny Rogers and later dancing the Macarena. As one of the on-site security guards, Richard spots a suspicious backpack that turns out to be holding the bomb that detonates, creating tragedy for many. As the viewing audience, we know that Richard's actions saved lives and he most definitely was not responsible for planting the bomb. And it's that knowing that places us as close as possible to the Richard Jewell experience.\n\nFour-time Oscar winner Clint Eastwood directs yet another story of a working-class hero. Only this time, he blatantly calls out what he sees as two evil forces: the U.S. Government (the FBI) and the media. Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, SHATTERED GLASS) based his script on the 1997 Vanity Fair article "American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell" by Marie Brenner (who also wrote the article that was the source for THE INSIDER, 1999). It can be argued that Eastwood comes down hard on the FBI and the media, but you might consider putting yourself in Richard Jewell's shoes before crying foul.\n\nJon Hamm has perfected the role of cocksure FBI agent and here he plays Tom Shaw as the man totally focused on proving Richard Jewell was the perpetrator. Much has been made of Eastwood's depiction of Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde, who directed this year's surprise hit BOOKSMART). It's a bit curious that the uproar is over what some interpret as a reporter trading intimate relations for a scoop, yet Eastwood's contempt seems focused more on the idea of trying a citizen's case in public ... while lacking any real evidence outside of a profile. The reporter (Ms. Scruggs passed away in 2001) is certainly portrayed as an ultra-aggressive reporter desperate for a headline story, but the implied consensual affair occurred after the inside information was provided - and the FBI agent was actually surprised... "Is this really going to happen?" Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.\n\nTwo key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right.

Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.\n\nWe first see Richard (played by Paul Walter Hauser in one of the year's best performances) as a supply clerk at a law firm in 1986. His awkward ways and surprising efficiency catches the eye of attorney Watson Bryant (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell), a quasi-connection that comes into play a decade later. We then jump ahead those 10 years to find Richard being fired from his campus security job at a college due to his over-zealous focus on protocol. Fortunately for Richard, the Olympics are coming to Atlanta, so finding work as a security guard is pretty easy.\n\nAtlanta's Centennial Olympic Park is shown with crowds of people cheering at a Kenny Rogers and later dancing the Macarena. As one of the on-site security guards, Richard spots a suspicious backpack that turns out to be holding the bomb that detonates, creating tragedy for many. As the viewing audience, we know that Richard's actions saved lives and he most definitely was not responsible for planting the bomb. And it's that knowing that places us as close as possible to the Richard Jewell experience.\n\nFour-time Oscar winner Clint Eastwood directs yet another story of a working-class hero. Only this time, he blatantly calls out what he sees as two evil forces: the U.S. Government (the FBI) and the media. Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, SHATTERED GLASS) based his script on the 1997 Vanity Fair article "American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell" by Marie Brenner (who also wrote the article that was the source for THE INSIDER, 1999). It can be argued that Eastwood comes down hard on the FBI and the media, but you might consider putting yourself in Richard Jewell's shoes before crying foul.\n\nJon Hamm has perfected the role of cocksure FBI agent and here he plays Tom Shaw as the man totally focused on proving Richard Jewell was the perpetrator. Much has been made of Eastwood's depiction of Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde, who directed this year's surprise hit BOOKSMART). It's a bit curious that the uproar is over what some interpret as a reporter trading intimate relations for a scoop, yet Eastwood's contempt seems focused more on the idea of trying a citizen's case in public ... while lacking any real evidence outside of a profile. The reporter (Ms. Scruggs passed away in 2001) is certainly portrayed as an ultra-aggressive reporter desperate for a headline story, but the implied consensual affair occurred after the inside information was provided - and the FBI agent was actually surprised... "Is this really going to happen?" Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.\n\nTwo key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right. A rush to judgment can be seen as an abuse of power, whether it's by the media, a law enforcement agency, or folks on social media. At this stage of his career, director Eastwood seems more interested in telling stories than showing one. He offers up little visual artistry outside of the terrific performances, but this story ... it's a doozy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74442,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.\n\nWhile I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Misérables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.\n\nThere's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Misérables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.\n\nFirst, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.\n\nNext, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.\n\nHooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.\n\nThe pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.\n\nIn that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.\n\nCats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.\n\nThat story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.\n\nA little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.\n\nFrancesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.\n\nThere's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.\n\nAs a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.\n\nSo, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.\n\nIn short, Cats is an absolute atrocity. From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.\n\nThere's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":46283,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-12-20","keywords":"elderly people,worst picture razzie winner,dancing,uncanny valley,singing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2898837273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179479/","name":"James Corden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3716653/","name":"Jason Derulo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346224/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355822/","name":"Lee Hall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515908/","name":"Andrew Lloyd Webber"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.\n\nWhile I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Misérables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.\n\nThere's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Misérables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.\n\nFirst, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.\n\nNext, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.\n\nHooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.\n\nThe pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.\n\nIn that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.\n\nCats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.\n\nThat story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.\n\nA little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.\n\nFrancesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.\n\nThere's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.\n\nAs a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.\n\nSo, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.\n\nIn short, Cats is an absolute atrocity.

It is visually stunning, informative, cute, fun to watch, emotionally investable and with adorable without being too much so penguins. It does help if already a major fan of nature documentaries and if one has a lifelong adoration for penguins, both the case with me ('Pingu' plays a major role in my love for penguins). Hearing that there was a follow up, part of me was intrigued but part of me also thought "is this really necessary?"\n\n'March of the Penguins 2', or 'L'Empereur' was a worthwhile watch and is recommended. Am not raving about it but liked it just about enough. It doesn't disgrace 'March of the Penguins' at all and has a lot of its great things, though it doesn't have the same amount of charm and magic and in a way it wasn't really needed. Morgan Freeman returning was a very good move and the right one, genius really and it would not have worked as well with somebody else.\n\nShall start with what 'March of the Penguins 2' does well, which is a lot. It looks beautiful first and foremost. Especially the majestic scenery, that has sheer beauty and at times a suitably harsh atmosphere to show that such a beautiful environment is not all idyllic. The music has some playfulness, some lushness and some dramatic sweep, not feeling too intrusive which sometimes was the case with DisneyNature documentaries.\n\nFurthermore, 'March of the Penguins 2' entertains and educates. Doing a great job with making the viewer relate to the penguins, the offspring being particularly adorable. While there are playful moments, a good deal of the journey/story is poignant. Freeman is a perfect choice for narrator, and he brings booming gravitas and subtlety to the nice mix of facts and human-like story.\n\nWill agree though that some of the material did feel a bit too derivative from looking as if it was lifted from elsewhere or too similar to footage in the first and at times repetitive from lacking sometimes variety.\n\nThere are times too when the cuteness early on is a little overkill. Other documentaries have information that is more illuminating and that is fresher, which added to the derivative feel.\n\nOverall, not great but very worthwhile. 7/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":726,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Documentary","Family"],"datePublished":"2017-02-15","keywords":"marching,aerial camera shot,hunger,tribe,survival","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4155556121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2I1MTRiZDctYjU5OC00NWQ4LWEwYjgtMjMyYzZmOThkODhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2I1MTRiZDctYjU5OC00NWQ4LWEwYjgtMjMyYzZmOThkODhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933727/","name":"Lambert Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009636/","name":"Thomas Acda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415207/","name":"Luc Jacquet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136751/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330681/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0629087/"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is visually stunning, informative, cute, fun to watch, emotionally investable and with adorable without being too much so penguins. It does help if already a major fan of nature documentaries and if one has a lifelong adoration for penguins, both the case with me ('Pingu' plays a major role in my love for penguins). Hearing that there was a follow up, part of me was intrigued but part of me also thought "is this really necessary?"\n\n'March of the Penguins 2', or 'L'Empereur' was a worthwhile watch and is recommended. Am not raving about it but liked it just about enough. It doesn't disgrace 'March of the Penguins' at all and has a lot of its great things, though it doesn't have the same amount of charm and magic and in a way it wasn't really needed. Morgan Freeman returning was a very good move and the right one, genius really and it would not have worked as well with somebody else.\n\nShall start with what 'March of the Penguins 2' does well, which is a lot. It looks beautiful first and foremost. Especially the majestic scenery, that has sheer beauty and at times a suitably harsh atmosphere to show that such a beautiful environment is not all idyllic. The music has some playfulness, some lushness and some dramatic sweep, not feeling too intrusive which sometimes was the case with DisneyNature documentaries.\n\nFurthermore, 'March of the Penguins 2' entertains and educates. Doing a great job with making the viewer relate to the penguins, the offspring being particularly adorable. While there are playful moments, a good deal of the journey/story is poignant. Freeman is a perfect choice for narrator, and he brings booming gravitas and subtlety to the nice mix of facts and human-like story.\n\nWill agree though that some of the material did feel a bit too derivative from looking as if it was lifted from elsewhere or too similar to footage in the first and at times repetitive from lacking sometimes variety.\n\nThere are times too when the cuteness early on is a little overkill. Other documentaries have information that is more illuminating and that is fresher, which added to the derivative feel.\n\nOverall, not great but very worthwhile. 7/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":726,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Documentary","Family"],"datePublished":"2017-02-15","keywords":"marching,aerial camera shot,hunger,tribe,survival","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4155556121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2I1MTRiZDctYjU5OC00NWQ4LWEwYjgtMjMyYzZmOThkODhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2I1MTRiZDctYjU5OC00NWQ4LWEwYjgtMjMyYzZmOThkODhmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933727/","name":"Lambert Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009636/","name":"Thomas Acda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415207/","name":"Luc Jacquet"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330681/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0629087/"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It will be a pleasure to those of you who like these kinds of things.\n\nHowever, it took a strenuous effort to get to like these snotty brat kids. They weren't even the typical Speilbergian know-it-all kids who also have good qualities, but these kids just didn't seem to have any at all, until the end. The jerk sister remained a jerk throughout and was never pleasant, she was a b**** all the way.\n\nThe Dad as played by Tim Robbins is just what I'd figure Tim Robbins would be as a Dad, a measly, weak-willed, emotional wreck, prone to flying off the handle, and no wonder he was divorced.\n\nOnce you get to where you can ignore these dysfunctional family members and think of them as plot fodder, you can go along for the ride.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98364,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-03-08","keywords":"playing a board game,sibling rivalry,board game,two brothers,outer space","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Zathura","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1608712473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MmYyZTAtZGVkNC00NWQzLWE4OGEtNmNmNGM0OWY1ZDNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ0MmYyZTAtZGVkNC00NWQzLWE4OGEtNmNmNGM0OWY1ZDNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1242688/","name":"Josh Hutcherson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1501050/","name":"Jonah Bobo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1009277/","name":"Dax Shepard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0269463/","name":"Jon Favreau"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060719/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0885575/","name":"Chris Van Allsburg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436960/","name":"John Kamps"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A pleasant antidote to the cheery Disney fare regularly served to the young set, the film is diverting fun. \n\nThere are still twists and turns in the film but it's less of a giddy roller coaster ride than expected. Based on Alan Snow's novel, Here Be Monsters, the darker tone of the book has been substantially altered and lightened up for a more crowd-pleasing effect, although there are some grotesque moments that may frighten the little ones.\n\nMoviegoers are immediately transported to the dingy squalor of brick factories and small shoppes that line the cobblestone streets of Dicken's Ole Victorian London town, or, in this case, renamed Cheesebridge. The upper and lower class live here, both in fear of the Boxtrolls, a lower lower subspecies that dwell underground who are part monster, part cardboard. Living amidst them is Eggs, an abandoned child who was lovingly raised by these creatures that roam the night to recycle the discarded refuse left by people. They avoid human contact as much as possible. Who can blame them! There is the haughty and aristocratic Lord and Lady Portley-Rind, their inquisitive and precocious daughter, Winnie, and especially Archibald Snatcher, a scheming and hateful villain whose main goal is to do away with all Boxtrolls! \n\nAs with most animated films nowadays, the visual elements are far superior to the narrative story. The Boxtrolls are not the exception. While the script has some clever dialog, an involving tale, and its charming characters, the plot becomes too formula-driven and conventional. The screenplay by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava relies too heavily on slapstick and chase sequences rather than developing any deep characterizations. The Boxtrolls themselves lack any real distinctive personalities and that British droll humor is in short supply. Everything seems a tad too predictable and ordinary, except for the artistry of the filmmakers and their wonderful details with the elaborate settings, steam-punk gadgetry, and off-beat characters. Special kudos to the remarkable production design by Paul Lasaine. \n\nThe voice-over work by the actors (Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Tracy Morgan) is highly accomplished and adds even more joy to the film, especially with Sir Ben Kingley's marvelous line delivery as the nasty baddie who completely steals the film. (In fact, Archibald is more interesting than our hero, Eggs, at least, as viewed in this film adaptation. Kingsley has created one of the best animated villains in years, although part of his great performance pays direct homage to Dame Edna.)\n\nDirectors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi painstakingly create a unique world of grime and clutter. They also allow the surreal elements to emerge to maximum effect, particularly in the underground sequences.

 --- Description: The Boxtrolls: Directed by Graham Annable, Anthony Stacchi. With Steve Blum, Dee Bradley Baker, Max Mitchell, Ben Kingsley. A young orphaned boy raised by underground cave-dwelling trash collectors tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0787474/","name":"The Boxtrolls","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODA5MDkyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMyNjkzMjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young orphaned boy raised by underground cave-dwelling trash collectors tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0787474/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"jadepietro","dateCreated":"2014-10-01","inLanguage":"English","name":"Thinking Outside the Box","reviewBody":"This film is recommended.\n\nThe Boxtrolls, a well-crafted stop motion animation film combined with the latest CGI advances, is an entertaining but somewhat safer and slightly sanitized film from Laika, the same studio that delivered Coraline and ParaNorman, two earlier children's film with a twisted Gothic edge. A pleasant antidote to the cheery Disney fare regularly served to the young set, the film is diverting fun. \n\nThere are still twists and turns in the film but it's less of a giddy roller coaster ride than expected. Based on Alan Snow's novel, Here Be Monsters, the darker tone of the book has been substantially altered and lightened up for a more crowd-pleasing effect, although there are some grotesque moments that may frighten the little ones.\n\nMoviegoers are immediately transported to the dingy squalor of brick factories and small shoppes that line the cobblestone streets of Dicken's Ole Victorian London town, or, in this case, renamed Cheesebridge. The upper and lower class live here, both in fear of the Boxtrolls, a lower lower subspecies that dwell underground who are part monster, part cardboard. Living amidst them is Eggs, an abandoned child who was lovingly raised by these creatures that roam the night to recycle the discarded refuse left by people. They avoid human contact as much as possible. Who can blame them! There is the haughty and aristocratic Lord and Lady Portley-Rind, their inquisitive and precocious daughter, Winnie, and especially Archibald Snatcher, a scheming and hateful villain whose main goal is to do away with all Boxtrolls! \n\nAs with most animated films nowadays, the visual elements are far superior to the narrative story. The Boxtrolls are not the exception. While the script has some clever dialog, an involving tale, and its charming characters, the plot becomes too formula-driven and conventional. The screenplay by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava relies too heavily on slapstick and chase sequences rather than developing any deep characterizations. The Boxtrolls themselves lack any real distinctive personalities and that British droll humor is in short supply. Everything seems a tad too predictable and ordinary, except for the artistry of the filmmakers and their wonderful details with the elaborate settings, steam-punk gadgetry, and off-beat characters. Special kudos to the remarkable production design by Paul Lasaine. \n\nThe voice-over work by the actors (Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Tracy Morgan) is highly accomplished and adds even more joy to the film, especially with Sir Ben Kingley's marvelous line delivery as the nasty baddie who completely steals the film. (In fact, Archibald is more interesting than our hero, Eggs, at least, as viewed in this film adaptation. Kingsley has created one of the best animated villains in years, although part of his great performance pays direct homage to Dame Edna.)\n\nDirectors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi painstakingly create a unique world of grime and clutter. They also allow the surreal elements to emerge to maximum effect, particularly in the underground sequences. Though the film lacks some cohesiveness in its story-telling, The Boxtrolls, more often than not, does think outside the box. With all its creative energy and technical inventiveness on display, even Roald Dahl would be proud.

Gives the term 'star-studded' a new meaning. Imagine what kind of film you could make with all that talent. Well, Valentine's Day is not that film. Far from it in fact. This who's who of a cast hampers any chance of real emotion due to the need to share screen time among them all. When you start getting interested in a character you'll most likely not see them again for another 45 minutes, pretty annoying when there are so few likable characters in the first place.\n\nWhat is perhaps the scariest is that despite a plethora of plots, subplots and sub-subplots – all intertwining somehow – there isn't a shred of originality. Sure, you might be surprised who Bradley Cooper hooks up with at the end, but one small unforeseen twist barely counts. Bulge and fluff replace characterization and narrative development whilst the corny dialogue comes off as cutesy more than cute. It all goes back to the bloated cast: with over 20 stars that need their quota of jokes, sobs and happy endings filled, it's majorly difficult to dedicate any real time to exploring the unique intricacies of love and loss.

Gives the term 'star-studded' a new meaning. Imagine what kind of film you could make with all that talent. Well, Valentine's Day is not that film. Far from it in fact. This who's who of a cast hampers any chance of real emotion due to the need to share screen time among them all. When you start getting interested in a character you'll most likely not see them again for another 45 minutes, pretty annoying when there are so few likable characters in the first place.\n\nWhat is perhaps the scariest is that despite a plethora of plots, subplots and sub-subplots – all intertwining somehow – there isn't a shred of originality. Sure, you might be surprised who Bradley Cooper hooks up with at the end, but one small unforeseen twist barely counts. Bulge and fluff replace characterization and narrative development whilst the corny dialogue comes off as cutesy more than cute. It all goes back to the bloated cast: with over 20 stars that need their quota of jokes, sobs and happy endings filled, it's majorly difficult to dedicate any real time to exploring the unique intricacies of love and loss. See the far superior Love Actually for how it's done.\n\nSaving it from complete dreadfulness is a handful of these big names – probably not the ones you would suspect – who manage to squeeze a laugh from their one-dimensional roles.

A pleasant antidote to the cheery Disney fare regularly served to the young set, the film is diverting fun. \n\nThere are still twists and turns in the film but it's less of a giddy roller coaster ride than expected. Based on Alan Snow's novel, Here Be Monsters, the darker tone of the book has been substantially altered and lightened up for a more crowd-pleasing effect, although there are some grotesque moments that may frighten the little ones.\n\nMoviegoers are immediately transported to the dingy squalor of brick factories and small shoppes that line the cobblestone streets of Dicken's Ole Victorian London town, or, in this case, renamed Cheesebridge. The upper and lower class live here, both in fear of the Boxtrolls, a lower lower subspecies that dwell underground who are part monster, part cardboard. Living amidst them is Eggs, an abandoned child who was lovingly raised by these creatures that roam the night to recycle the discarded refuse left by people. They avoid human contact as much as possible. Who can blame them! There is the haughty and aristocratic Lord and Lady Portley-Rind, their inquisitive and precocious daughter, Winnie, and especially Archibald Snatcher, a scheming and hateful villain whose main goal is to do away with all Boxtrolls! \n\nAs with most animated films nowadays, the visual elements are far superior to the narrative story. The Boxtrolls are not the exception. While the script has some clever dialog, an involving tale, and its charming characters, the plot becomes too formula-driven and conventional. The screenplay by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava relies too heavily on slapstick and chase sequences rather than developing any deep characterizations. The Boxtrolls themselves lack any real distinctive personalities and that British droll humor is in short supply. Everything seems a tad too predictable and ordinary, except for the artistry of the filmmakers and their wonderful details with the elaborate settings, steam-punk gadgetry, and off-beat characters. Special kudos to the remarkable production design by Paul Lasaine. \n\nThe voice-over work by the actors (Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Tracy Morgan) is highly accomplished and adds even more joy to the film, especially with Sir Ben Kingley's marvelous line delivery as the nasty baddie who completely steals the film. (In fact, Archibald is more interesting than our hero, Eggs, at least, as viewed in this film adaptation. Kingsley has created one of the best animated villains in years, although part of his great performance pays direct homage to Dame Edna.)\n\nDirectors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi painstakingly create a unique world of grime and clutter. They also allow the surreal elements to emerge to maximum effect, particularly in the underground sequences. Though the film lacks some cohesiveness in its story-telling, The Boxtrolls, more often than not, does think outside the box. With all its creative energy and technical inventiveness on display, even Roald Dahl would be proud.

Based on Alan Snow's novel, Here Be Monsters, the darker tone of the book has been substantially altered and lightened up for a more crowd-pleasing effect, although there are some grotesque moments that may frighten the little ones.\n\nMoviegoers are immediately transported to the dingy squalor of brick factories and small shoppes that line the cobblestone streets of Dicken's Ole Victorian London town, or, in this case, renamed Cheesebridge. The upper and lower class live here, both in fear of the Boxtrolls, a lower lower subspecies that dwell underground who are part monster, part cardboard. Living amidst them is Eggs, an abandoned child who was lovingly raised by these creatures that roam the night to recycle the discarded refuse left by people. They avoid human contact as much as possible. Who can blame them! There is the haughty and aristocratic Lord and Lady Portley-Rind, their inquisitive and precocious daughter, Winnie, and especially Archibald Snatcher, a scheming and hateful villain whose main goal is to do away with all Boxtrolls! \n\nAs with most animated films nowadays, the visual elements are far superior to the narrative story. The Boxtrolls are not the exception. While the script has some clever dialog, an involving tale, and its charming characters, the plot becomes too formula-driven and conventional. The screenplay by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava relies too heavily on slapstick and chase sequences rather than developing any deep characterizations. The Boxtrolls themselves lack any real distinctive personalities and that British droll humor is in short supply. Everything seems a tad too predictable and ordinary, except for the artistry of the filmmakers and their wonderful details with the elaborate settings, steam-punk gadgetry, and off-beat characters. Special kudos to the remarkable production design by Paul Lasaine. \n\nThe voice-over work by the actors (Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Tracy Morgan) is highly accomplished and adds even more joy to the film, especially with Sir Ben Kingley's marvelous line delivery as the nasty baddie who completely steals the film. (In fact, Archibald is more interesting than our hero, Eggs, at least, as viewed in this film adaptation. Kingsley has created one of the best animated villains in years, although part of his great performance pays direct homage to Dame Edna.)\n\nDirectors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi painstakingly create a unique world of grime and clutter. They also allow the surreal elements to emerge to maximum effect, particularly in the underground sequences. Though the film lacks some cohesiveness in its story-telling, The Boxtrolls, more often than not, does think outside the box. With all its creative energy and technical inventiveness on display, even Roald Dahl would be proud.

Barrie favourite that has yet been made. Indeed it is difficult to see how it could have been better.\n\nWhilst I'm writing here in praise of the film, I feel I must take issue with the comments of Mr John Ulmer who criticised the film for a number of reasons. I seek to defend the story of Peter Pan and in particular this version. Firstly, it was said that this version has sexual over/undertones.\n\nErm... well yes... any accurate portrayal of the story would have, as these subtleties are present en masse in the book, indeed more so in the book than in the film it could be argued. It is precisely this evident descent towards Wendy's loss of innocence that both disturbs and excites adult readers of the books and this is quite intentional. Children who are not of an age to appreciate this level are untouched by it but rather take delight in the glorious idea of never having to grow up but instead being allowed to play forever. Indeed the relationship between Pan and Hook is the struggle of youth to overcome the onset of age (singular human vanity and innocent childish rebellion combined). I do not believe that this film's handling of this aspect of the book was merely present in "sick adult humour", I believe that it was beautifully hinted at in a way which would stimulate adult appreciation and childish fascination in the character of Pan.\n\nI should like to make mention of the parallel which Mr Ulmer draws between this version of Peter Pan and Jumanji (namely the use of the same actors to play the adversary and the father of the lead character) is not just a trick put in to hark back to that film. Indeed the tradition of the same actor playing the role of Mr Darling AND Hook dates back to the story's original appearance as a stage play at the turn of the century and has been carried on on most occasions since then, though I concede that the Disney version (a far less worthy and sterilised version) failed to keep this tradition up.\n\nAs for the point at which the two boys are hung upside down in their nightshirts, I thought it was funny, as did the rest of the audience in the theatre and we certainly weren't there with a red pen counting the number of bottom shots as Mr Ulmer appears to have done. This film is full of charming humour, adult overtones for the adults, childish fantasy and wonderment for those of the appropriate age. The acting is superb in all areas and I must make particular mention of both Ludivine Sagnier as a wickedly funny Tink and of course Rachel Hurd-Wood whose screen debut showed her as a previously undiscovered talent who will surely go far. All the others were excellent also.\n\nAll in all this film rekindled my love of the book which I have now re-read a number of times and makes up for all those years Pan has spent in the Disney wilderness."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69273,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-12-31","keywords":"peter pan character,captain hook character,smee character,wendy darling character,gagged girl","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Peter Pan","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2077470745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmRiODI5MmEtMGZkOC00NTc4LWIyMGUtOTE5ZmVkMzZjNzU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmRiODI5MmEtMGZkOC00NTc4LWIyMGUtOTE5ZmVkMzZjNzU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Peter Pan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0838911/","name":"Jeremy Sumpter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005042/","name":"Jason Isaacs"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0931404/","name":"Olivia Williams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0389591/","name":"P.J.

Barrie favourite that has yet been made. Indeed it is difficult to see how it could have been better.\n\nWhilst I'm writing here in praise of the film, I feel I must take issue with the comments of Mr John Ulmer who criticised the film for a number of reasons. I seek to defend the story of Peter Pan and in particular this version. Firstly, it was said that this version has sexual over/undertones.\n\nErm... well yes... any accurate portrayal of the story would have, as these subtleties are present en masse in the book, indeed more so in the book than in the film it could be argued. It is precisely this evident descent towards Wendy's loss of innocence that both disturbs and excites adult readers of the books and this is quite intentional. Children who are not of an age to appreciate this level are untouched by it but rather take delight in the glorious idea of never having to grow up but instead being allowed to play forever. Indeed the relationship between Pan and Hook is the struggle of youth to overcome the onset of age (singular human vanity and innocent childish rebellion combined). I do not believe that this film's handling of this aspect of the book was merely present in "sick adult humour", I believe that it was beautifully hinted at in a way which would stimulate adult appreciation and childish fascination in the character of Pan.\n\nI should like to make mention of the parallel which Mr Ulmer draws between this version of Peter Pan and Jumanji (namely the use of the same actors to play the adversary and the father of the lead character) is not just a trick put in to hark back to that film. Indeed the tradition of the same actor playing the role of Mr Darling AND Hook dates back to the story's original appearance as a stage play at the turn of the century and has been carried on on most occasions since then, though I concede that the Disney version (a far less worthy and sterilised version) failed to keep this tradition up.\n\nAs for the point at which the two boys are hung upside down in their nightshirts, I thought it was funny, as did the rest of the audience in the theatre and we certainly weren't there with a red pen counting the number of bottom shots as Mr Ulmer appears to have done. This film is full of charming humour, adult overtones for the adults, childish fantasy and wonderment for those of the appropriate age. The acting is superb in all areas and I must make particular mention of both Ludivine Sagnier as a wickedly funny Tink and of course Rachel Hurd-Wood whose screen debut showed her as a previously undiscovered talent who will surely go far. All the others were excellent also.\n\nAll in all this film rekindled my love of the book which I have now re-read a number of times and makes up for all those years Pan has spent in the Disney wilderness.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69273,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-12-31","keywords":"peter pan character,captain hook character,smee character,wendy darling character,gagged girl","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Peter Pan","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2077470745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmRiODI5MmEtMGZkOC00NTc4LWIyMGUtOTE5ZmVkMzZjNzU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmRiODI5MmEtMGZkOC00NTc4LWIyMGUtOTE5ZmVkMzZjNzU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Peter Pan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0838911/","name":"Jeremy Sumpter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005042/","name":"Jason Isaacs","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0931404/","name":"Olivia Williams"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0389591/","name":"P.J.

Gracie is chosen to be the new face of FBI, a model to every agent by appearing in public, holding press conferences or even writing a book. Meanwhile, her best and only friend, Miss USA, has been kidnapped by two people who want a five million dollars ransom. Together with her makeup crew, her bodyguard (Sam) and a newly met agent from Vegas, she must save her friend before it's too late.\n\nIt's a movie who's story is a bit exaggerated and somewhat predictable, being focused more on the interaction between Gracie, her crew and her "fights" with Sam rather than on the action itself. It still follows the same pattern as the first movie, like being funny and entertaining but it's not as well-rounded as its predecessor. I know it could have been a better movie but unfortunately it isn't, thus leaving a sensation of mediocrity, of a sequel made just because the first installment had success.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2005-04-06","keywords":"knee high boots,boots,undercover,tied to a chair,bound and gagged","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4036362521","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWQzY2MyMGEtZDI4OS00MTU2LTg5OGQtZWY4NjBhNGQxZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWQzY2MyMGEtZDI4OS00MTU2LTg5OGQtZWY4NjBhNGQxZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005093/","name":"Regina King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000638/","name":"William Shatner"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0664756/","name":"John Pasquin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015475/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492909/","name":"Marc Lawrence"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0974301/","name":"Katie Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524095/","name":"Caryn Lucas"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Gracie is chosen to be the new face of FBI, a model to every agent by appearing in public, holding press conferences or even writing a book. Meanwhile, her best and only friend, Miss USA, has been kidnapped by two people who want a five million dollars ransom. Together with her makeup crew, her bodyguard (Sam) and a newly met agent from Vegas, she must save her friend before it's too late.\n\nIt's a movie who's story is a bit exaggerated and somewhat predictable, being focused more on the interaction between Gracie, her crew and her "fights" with Sam rather than on the action itself. It still follows the same pattern as the first movie, like being funny and entertaining but it's not as well-rounded as its predecessor. I know it could have been a better movie but unfortunately it isn't, thus leaving a sensation of mediocrity, of a sequel made just because the first installment had success.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71894,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2005-04-06","keywords":"knee high boots,boots,undercover,tied to a chair,bound and gagged","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4036362521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWQzY2MyMGEtZDI4OS00MTU2LTg5OGQtZWY4NjBhNGQxZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWQzY2MyMGEtZDI4OS00MTU2LTg5OGQtZWY4NjBhNGQxZmE3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005093/","name":"Regina King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000638/","name":"William Shatner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0664756/","name":"John Pasquin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015475/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492909/","name":"Marc Lawrence","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0974301/","name":"Katie Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524095/","name":"Caryn Lucas"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Firstly, I really enjoyed John Michael McDonagh's Calvary with Brendan Gleeson, both written and directed by McDonagh, just like this film. Secondly, Michael Peña being one of my favourite actors since the film Crash and have liked him in everything since. Thirdly, this year's Tarzan, Alexander Skarsgård, having enjoyed his John Clayton/Tarzan I was eager to see what else he can offer. \n\nPeña and Skargård play Bob and Terry, two corrupt cops who wreck havoc across New Mexico taking and doing whatever they want under the protection of their badge and guns, roughing up criminals in their unorthodox policing methods, who are unfortunately enough to get in their way.

Firstly, I really enjoyed John Michael McDonagh's Calvary with Brendan Gleeson, both written and directed by McDonagh, just like this film. Secondly, Michael Peña being one of my favourite actors since the film Crash and have liked him in everything since. Thirdly, this year's Tarzan, Alexander Skarsgård, having enjoyed his John Clayton/Tarzan I was eager to see what else he can offer. \n\nPeña and Skargård play Bob and Terry, two corrupt cops who wreck havoc across New Mexico taking and doing whatever they want under the protection of their badge and guns, roughing up criminals in their unorthodox policing methods, who are unfortunately enough to get in their way. Skargård's Terry being the hulking, unhinged, drunkard that swaggers about punching most people in the face; a lot, and Peña's Bob is the intellect of the two, smart-talking and quick-thinking being his forte, throwing out quirky philosophical comments at any given moment.

Sure, the whole gang are all there, but unfortunately the action isn't. There must have been less than 20 minutes of decent chases, crashes and other action in the entire movie, and the gags and humor were getting a little tired after the 3 previous movies.

I'm not sure what Luc Besson was up to, or was on, when making this movie, but I find it interesting that there's a new 'mobile internet' website for finding taxis on your mob phone with the exact same name, ( t4xi.mobi ), and that on you-tube right now there's ' T4XI ' video clips all over the place! Whether this is some last minute attempt to cross market or boost ticket sales, I don't know, but it's interesting to note that the t4xi.mobi site appeared at almost the same time as T4XI, the movie.

The trouble, though, is that it is only good for "X" many jokes.\n\nFor a basic plot summary, "Mall Cop" focuses on Paul Blart (James), an overweight mall "security officer" who continually fails to become a true gun-toting policeman. Just when his life seems to be at the lowest, however, he is thrust into a high-pressure hostage situation that tests his mettle.\n\nThe first thirty or so minutes of this film are legitimately funny, watching Blart blunder through situation after situation. James is an accomplished physical comedian who knows exactly how to comically move his oversized body.\n\nYet, the jokes stop being funny in the second half, when the film gets a little too repetitive. Those same "fat jokes" that worked so well in the opener are old hat once the climax approaches.\n\nThus, this is a decent little family-friendly comedy. It isn't great, but you'll genuinely laugh on more than a few occasions.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106502,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2009-04-15","keywords":"mall cop,shopping mall,reference to scooby doo,single father,die hard scenario","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"DVD Trailer: Paul Blart: Mall Cop","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1000931865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5ODYwNzIzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA5MjU1Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5ODYwNzIzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA5MjU1Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When a shopping mall is overtaken by a gang of organized crooks, it's up to the a mild-mannered security guard to save the day."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1218757/","name":"Keir O'Donnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1724323/","name":"Jayma Mays"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0139867/","name":"Steve Carr"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048169/","name":"Nick Bakay"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The trouble, though, is that it is only good for "X" many jokes.\n\nFor a basic plot summary, "Mall Cop" focuses on Paul Blart (James), an overweight mall "security officer" who continually fails to become a true gun-toting policeman. Just when his life seems to be at the lowest, however, he is thrust into a high-pressure hostage situation that tests his mettle.\n\nThe first thirty or so minutes of this film are legitimately funny, watching Blart blunder through situation after situation. James is an accomplished physical comedian who knows exactly how to comically move his oversized body.\n\nYet, the jokes stop being funny in the second half, when the film gets a little too repetitive. Those same "fat jokes" that worked so well in the opener are old hat once the climax approaches.\n\nThus, this is a decent little family-friendly comedy. It isn't great, but you'll genuinely laugh on more than a few occasions.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106502,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2009-04-15","keywords":"mall cop,shopping mall,reference to scooby doo,single father,die hard scenario","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"DVD Trailer: Paul Blart: Mall Cop","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1000931865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5ODYwNzIzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA5MjU1Mg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5ODYwNzIzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTA5MjU1Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When a shopping mall is overtaken by a gang of organized crooks, it's up to the a mild-mannered security guard to save the day.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1218757/","name":"Keir O'Donnell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1724323/","name":"Jayma Mays"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0139867/","name":"Steve Carr"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048169/","name":"Nick Bakay"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So much that we won't forget certain instances when the other person (perpetrator) might have already forgotten about them. Something that is big thing in this movie. The bigger thing is though, the inability to see the good thing right in front of you sometimes.\n\nAnd so while we do know where this is heading (or running at some point), the main characters need more conviction than that. And also you have to fill the 90 minutes somehow, don't you? It's still pretty decent, if you like your teenage comedy/dramas played out in that sort of romantic fashion.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1362,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-08-28","keywords":"bike accident,male in shower,taking a shower,condom,female rear nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2475408153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmIzYjljZTgtN2E3Mi00ODY1LWI2ZDItNjc4YWZiNWQ5NTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmIzYjljZTgtN2E3Mi00ODY1LWI2ZDItNjc4YWZiNWQ5NTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3612367/","name":"Merlin Rose","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3582197/","name":"Lisa Vicari","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2001517/","name":"Max von der Groeben"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0678450/","name":"Marco Petry"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0225456/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0381995/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071976/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0678450/","name":"Marco Petry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1410739/","name":"Jan Ehlert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6807223/","name":"Jaromir Konecny"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered that Bridesmaids is better than The Hangover. I have yet to see The Hangover Part 2, so I can't comment on any similarities/differences that might or might not exist.

At the center of this battle is Helen, a newly acquired "friend"—via the merging of two exclusive social circles—who begins taking over the wedding plans for Lillian (Rudolph). Annie (Wiig) makes it her mission to take out this she-devil, and what follows is the setup for one of the more memorable meltdowns (among a plethora of other things) to come along in quite some time. Bridesmaids is also peppered with the sort of humor that made movies like Superbad and Knocked Up so funny—it's observant and kitschy in that it rightly jabs several other films that have braved similar issues. In fact, the previously mentioned Hangover is, in at least a very minute way, one of these movies. In what initially appears to be a sad "bow" to The Hangover as king of the pre-wedding funnies, the girls decide to go to Vegas for Lillian's bachelorette party. This ends up being a perfectly welcome curve ball, though, as screenwriters Wiig and Mumolo brilliantly utilize the length of the plane trip to said destination to further flesh out their characters and create an impressively humorous string of in-flight mishaps.\n\nThere are a number of other contributors who make Bridesmaids work extraordinarily well, but, as is the case with any solid piece of cinema, it's best if you set aside some time to take in the whole thing in one fell swoop and let it unravel of its own volition. Sure, it's extraordinarily raunchy from time to time, but the nuanced, perfectly- timed moments of comedic genius make it a very worthwhile trip.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":279558,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-05-13","keywords":"casual sex,loud sex,partial female nudity,sex scene,talking during sex","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridesmaids: International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4215119129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ODI0NTc2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1Njg4MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ODI0NTc2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1Njg4MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"AnnieÂ’s life is a mess.

Jim Carrey is often a great comedian, but this is him at his funniest side.\n\nThe story is very funny and entertaining: Fletcher Reede, a lawyer with the habit of lying and breaking promises, suddenly sees himself forced to become honest during the next 24 hours after his son's birthday wish comes true. He doesn't understand what's happening to him and that is driving him insane... he can't tell any lies, not even write a little lie! Whenever he tries to and whenever he talks, it's a huge mess for sure! He even transforms the court room into a circus, seems to lose his mind and makes goofy faces! Incredibly hilarious!\n\nThe actors have great performances. Jim Carrey is great as Fletcher Reede, but there are other equally good actors, like Maura Tierney as Audrey Reede, Cary Elwes as Jerry and little Justin Cooper as Max (Fletcher's son). Max is also referred to as "Maximillian" and "Monster Max" by his father, who loves to do "The Claw" much for his son's delight. I know Cary Elwes from "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" and I do know that he is an English actor, but he speaks with a good American accent in this film. Some might think that Jim Carrey overacts here and that his humor is too crummy, but the energy he shows here is not something anybody could do. It requires a very energetic and patient comedian and Jim Carrey proves his talent to do so. The kid is cute. He almost looks like Sean Marshall in "Pete's Dragon", with that face and long hair.\n\nAt my point of view, "Liar Liar" has funny humor, not irritating or dirty humor. It is a modern light-hearted comedy. Its aim is purely fun at the highest level. I think it's difficult not laughing while watching this movie. Lots of very funny lines are another attribute.\n\nDirected by Tom Shadyac, "Liar Liar" is the best thing Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac ever did together and slightly superior than the later "Bruce Almighty".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":292374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1997-03-21","keywords":"birthday wish,obscene finger gesture,female stockinged feet,pantyhose,workaholic","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000120/","name":"Jim Carrey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005491/","name":"Maura Tierney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000372/","name":"Amanda Donohoe"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001723/","name":"Tom Shadyac"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0345488/","name":"Paul Guay"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0563397/","name":"Stephen Mazur"}],"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Of course, this story has it's clichés and I'm the most bored person on the earth by clichés but this movie is a little bit different.

The characters were lovely and I was surprised for them to not look over-acted and exaggerated.\n\nThe cinematography, editing were pretty much normal, nothing to be mentioned and the score was as usual, typical for a romantic movie.

Imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered that Bridesmaids is better than The Hangover. I have yet to see The Hangover Part 2, so I can't comment on any similarities/differences that might or might not exist. But one thing is for sure: Kristen Wiig has proved her worth as a female lead with a serious amount of comedic clout.\n\nThe story isn't revolutionary: one of two best friends is getting married, and everything involved with said nuptials is threatening to tear their lifelong friendship apart. At the center of this battle is Helen, a newly acquired "friend"—via the merging of two exclusive social circles—who begins taking over the wedding plans for Lillian (Rudolph). Annie (Wiig) makes it her mission to take out this she-devil, and what follows is the setup for one of the more memorable meltdowns (among a plethora of other things) to come along in quite some time. Bridesmaids is also peppered with the sort of humor that made movies like Superbad and Knocked Up so funny—it's observant and kitschy in that it rightly jabs several other films that have braved similar issues. In fact, the previously mentioned Hangover is, in at least a very minute way, one of these movies. In what initially appears to be a sad "bow" to The Hangover as king of the pre-wedding funnies, the girls decide to go to Vegas for Lillian's bachelorette party. This ends up being a perfectly welcome curve ball, though, as screenwriters Wiig and Mumolo brilliantly utilize the length of the plane trip to said destination to further flesh out their characters and create an impressively humorous string of in-flight mishaps.\n\nThere are a number of other contributors who make Bridesmaids work extraordinarily well, but, as is the case with any solid piece of cinema, it's best if you set aside some time to take in the whole thing in one fell swoop and let it unravel of its own volition. Sure, it's extraordinarily raunchy from time to time, but the nuanced, perfectly- timed moments of comedic genius make it a very worthwhile trip.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":279558,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-05-13","keywords":"casual sex,loud sex,partial female nudity,sex scene,talking during sex","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridesmaids: International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4215119129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ODI0NTc2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1Njg4MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ODI0NTc2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1Njg4MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"AnnieÂ’s life is a mess.

Imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered that Bridesmaids is better than The Hangover. I have yet to see The Hangover Part 2, so I can't comment on any similarities/differences that might or might not exist. But one thing is for sure: Kristen Wiig has proved her worth as a female lead with a serious amount of comedic clout.\n\nThe story isn't revolutionary: one of two best friends is getting married, and everything involved with said nuptials is threatening to tear their lifelong friendship apart. At the center of this battle is Helen, a newly acquired "friend"—via the merging of two exclusive social circles—who begins taking over the wedding plans for Lillian (Rudolph). Annie (Wiig) makes it her mission to take out this she-devil, and what follows is the setup for one of the more memorable meltdowns (among a plethora of other things) to come along in quite some time. Bridesmaids is also peppered with the sort of humor that made movies like Superbad and Knocked Up so funny—it's observant and kitschy in that it rightly jabs several other films that have braved similar issues. In fact, the previously mentioned Hangover is, in at least a very minute way, one of these movies. In what initially appears to be a sad "bow" to The Hangover as king of the pre-wedding funnies, the girls decide to go to Vegas for Lillian's bachelorette party. This ends up being a perfectly welcome curve ball, though, as screenwriters Wiig and Mumolo brilliantly utilize the length of the plane trip to said destination to further flesh out their characters and create an impressively humorous string of in-flight mishaps.\n\nThere are a number of other contributors who make Bridesmaids work extraordinarily well, but, as is the case with any solid piece of cinema, it's best if you set aside some time to take in the whole thing in one fell swoop and let it unravel of its own volition. Sure, it's extraordinarily raunchy from time to time, but the nuanced, perfectly- timed moments of comedic genius make it a very worthwhile trip.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":279558,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-05-13","keywords":"casual sex,loud sex,partial female nudity,sex scene,talking during sex","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridesmaids: International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4215119129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ODI0NTc2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1Njg4MjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ODI0NTc2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1Njg4MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"AnnieÂ’s life is a mess.

In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.  \n\n\t Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness.  Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump.  It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music.  (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.)  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones.  Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachable we can relate to her.  \n\nAs Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious.  (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.)  There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw (and I loved) in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' or `Sense and Sensibility.'  Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love.  Yes, it's a paradox, but that is what Grant brings to his role.  He makes being `bad' look so sexy.  You can't take your eyes off him; he brings his own humor to his role.  It's lovely, smoldering, and incredibly sexy. \n\n Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy (I think I might be in love with him, too).  He is also sexy and smoldering, but not in the same wild, fiery way as Daniel Cleaver.  Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role.  I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol, but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen. There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget, `I like you very much just the way you are.'  It's incredibly romantic and, for me, ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's `You complete me' in `Jerry Maguire.' He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger, which is moving and sexy all at the same time.  (And, of course, the author Helen Fielding used Colin Firth as the basis for Mark Darcy, so it all works out marvelously.) \t\n\nI also mentioned that the movie smartly builds on some elements that the book downplays.  Yes, there are certain parts of the movie that cannot be found in the book, but I'm still glad they put them in the movie.  Most of what they added doesn't necessarily build on plot but it does add to the characters.  I don't want to give anything away because it's rather hilarious what unfolds onscreen.  The movie is filmed in an almost Ally McBeal type of way but it remains true to the sincerity, cuteness, and pathetic naivete that Bridget Jones embodies.  There are no pretensions. It's an entirely wonderful film.   10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":233781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-10","keywords":"unfaithfulness,employer employee relationship,opposites attract,love triangle,book publishing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridget Jones's Diary","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi192783897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg4ZGY2MWItNTJlYy00YTE1LTg2ZTAtZGIyNDEzYWYzZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg4ZGY2MWItNTJlYy00YTE1LTg2ZTAtZGIyNDEzYWYzZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bridget Jones's Diary"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536632/","name":"Sharon Maguire"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276144/","name":"Helen Fielding"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0203577/","name":"Andrew Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.  \n\n\t Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness.  Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump.  It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music.  (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.)  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones.  Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachable we can relate to her.  \n\nAs Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious.  (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.)

It's amazing how a simple movie can do that, without even using the scent to lure you. Chocolate turns an ordinary village of France into a sweet world, a fairy tale among simple people. The costumes and the scenery are very believable, really capturing the era and the atmosphere, of that time. But the story is good as well, without getting boring, speaking about the love that can tie family and friends together, the stereotypes that support closed communities of the countryside and how a simple ingredient like chocolate, can turn everything upside down. Great performances from the main and supporting cast actors and a memorable soundtrack. All in all chocolate is a remarkable film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-24","keywords":"chocolate,france,village,food,magical realism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Chocolat","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2733547033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRjNGI4MmYtY2U1ZS00N2UzLTk5MzgtMjIxYjlhMDI2NWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRjNGI4MmYtY2U1ZS00N2UzLTk5MzgtMjIxYjlhMDI2NWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000547/","name":"Alfred Molina"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002120/","name":"Lasse Hallström"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031919/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104130/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0364862/","name":"Joanne Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414608/","name":"Robert Nelson Jacobs"}],"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's amazing how a simple movie can do that, without even using the scent to lure you. Chocolate turns an ordinary village of France into a sweet world, a fairy tale among simple people. The costumes and the scenery are very believable, really capturing the era and the atmosphere, of that time. But the story is good as well, without getting boring, speaking about the love that can tie family and friends together, the stereotypes that support closed communities of the countryside and how a simple ingredient like chocolate, can turn everything upside down. Great performances from the main and supporting cast actors and a memorable soundtrack. All in all chocolate is a remarkable film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-24","keywords":"chocolate,france,village,food,magical realism","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Chocolat","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2733547033","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRjNGI4MmYtY2U1ZS00N2UzLTk5MzgtMjIxYjlhMDI2NWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRjNGI4MmYtY2U1ZS00N2UzLTk5MzgtMjIxYjlhMDI2NWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000547/","name":"Alfred Molina"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002120/","name":"Lasse Hallström"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031919/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104130/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0364862/","name":"Joanne Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414608/","name":"Robert Nelson Jacobs"],"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.  \n\n\t Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness.  Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump.  It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music.  (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.)  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones.  Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachable we can relate to her.  \n\nAs Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious.  (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.)  There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw (and I loved) in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' or `Sense and Sensibility.'  Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love.  Yes, it's a paradox, but that is what Grant brings to his role.  He makes being `bad' look so sexy.  You can't take your eyes off him; he brings his own humor to his role.  It's lovely, smoldering, and incredibly sexy. \n\n Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy (I think I might be in love with him, too).  He is also sexy and smoldering, but not in the same wild, fiery way as Daniel Cleaver.  Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role.  I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol, but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen. There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget, `I like you very much just the way you are.'  It's incredibly romantic and, for me, ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's `You complete me' in `Jerry Maguire.' He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger, which is moving and sexy all at the same time.  (And, of course, the author Helen Fielding used Colin Firth as the basis for Mark Darcy, so it all works out marvelously.) \t\n\nI also mentioned that the movie smartly builds on some elements that the book downplays.  Yes, there are certain parts of the movie that cannot be found in the book, but I'm still glad they put them in the movie.  Most of what they added doesn't necessarily build on plot but it does add to the characters.  I don't want to give anything away because it's rather hilarious what unfolds onscreen.  The movie is filmed in an almost Ally McBeal type of way but it remains true to the sincerity, cuteness, and pathetic naivete that Bridget Jones embodies.  There are no pretensions. It's an entirely wonderful film.   10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":233781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-10","keywords":"unfaithfulness,employer employee relationship,opposites attract,love triangle,book publishing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridget Jones's Diary","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi192783897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg4ZGY2MWItNTJlYy00YTE1LTg2ZTAtZGIyNDEzYWYzZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg4ZGY2MWItNTJlYy00YTE1LTg2ZTAtZGIyNDEzYWYzZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bridget Jones's Diary"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536632/","name":"Sharon Maguire"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276144/","name":"Helen Fielding"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0203577/","name":"Andrew Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even though he might not know why, Mark positively adores Bridget. Colin gets that and twinkles, melts and warms in all the right places. Same goes for Daniel he's drawn to his Bridge for some inexplicable reason. Hugh Grant really ought to be looking for a patent for that mojo he works so well. All of the original actors are back as Bridget's parents and her "dating war command" of pals and all have a natural, easy chemistry that works. But, the negatives, they are a-plenty.\n\nBiggest problem here was the complete tone change. In the first film, we were on the ride with Bridget...seeing things through her eyes, groaning as she put her foot in her mouth again and cheering for her to finally get it right. However, in this movie, it feels like someone stuck her up on a stage and spent 2 hours throwing pies and tomatoes at her cause it seemed real cool. She's not in on the joke here, she IS the joke. Her few extra pounds are no longer just a part of the package  they are the end-all of her worth as a person. It feels like the folks behind this film don't even LIKE the character  they just think it's real cool to humiliate her as often as possible. It doesn't even look like they bothered to send Renee to makeup or wardrobe  she (as Bridget) was pleasantly plump in the first film, but never dowdy. The character is downright frumpy in this movie with a perpetual case of bed head and clothes that look like castoffs from Mayberry. And Renee plays into it with her acting choices  Bridget was frazzled in the first movie but still retained her dignity most of the time. She's a perpetual victim in this one, though, and even though Renee is still cute as a button and incredibly endearing, some of Bridget's spark is gone.\n\nWhat happens after the happy ending? Couple realizes that they are each real, flawed people. And the movie makes it seem like Mark is at that point  never tries to change Bridget, never gets angry and her constant mishaps amuse more than annoy. But, as each of Bridget's tantrums unfolded, I kept asking myself why in the WORLD the man was still there. Bridget's keen on him but doesn't trust him. She likes to be with him but is suspicious of his actions without any real cause. Now, we know she's an insecure character and feels like she's not classy enough to fit into his world. And if the movie built from that, maybe we'd have a different story. But the obstacles they face are external. The characters never make decisions on their own  something or someone else makes them feel a certain way or forces them into a course of action that decides what will happen next. And Bridget's reactions almost make it seem like somehow, over the course of the last 'six weeks', she's regressed to a girl in the schoolyard stomping her feet when her boyfriend does something she doesn't like.\n\nAnother problem  the utter lack of subtlety. Why include one fat joke when 3 or 4 plus a butt shot can fit into the scene? Why spend most of the movie dropping hints about a reveal when you can beat the audience over the head with it in one of the final scenes? Why have Daniel make one joke about stealing Mark's wife when he can drop another one 30 minutes later? Oh look, matching Christmas jumpers  how cute. Most of the funny in this movie comes from certain 'episodes' as opposed to the dialogue. I loved the ski trip and Bridget's 'magic mushrooms' in Thailand. But, when the characters are actually talking to each other, they just aren't that funny. Most of the jokes are reruns from the first movie that feel stale. The naughty jokes are kicked up a notch but everyone in my packed theater, including me, either grimaced or sat stone-faced through most of them. Note to filmmakers: dirty has to actually BE funny to be funny.\n\nThis feels like a movie about a woman made by men who think wet clothes, girl-on-girl action and butt close-ups get it done. I read some interviews that said that Renee would only do a second film if it took care of Bridget and held up the standards of the first. I almost wonder if someone slid her this script on the first day of shooting as a rewrite once she'd already signed on the dotted line. This felt like a bleached, harsher version of the first the warmth is gone. I know there was a different director and I really don't think the new kid gets why Bridget was/is such a phenomenon. As much as I was looking forward to this film, I wish they'd never done it.\n\nOh, and also, as a P.S.  if I was a Thai woman right now, I'd be suing Working Title and Miramax for defamation of character for their version of 'Fun with Stereotypes'."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110186,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-12-29","keywords":"thailand,marriage proposal,prison,boyfriend girlfriend relationship,opposites attract","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1468053017","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM4MjQzMDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM4MjQzMDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452319/","name":"Beeban Kidron"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276144/","name":"Helen Fielding"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0203577/","name":"Andrew Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even though he might not know why, Mark positively adores Bridget. Colin gets that and twinkles, melts and warms in all the right places. Same goes for Daniel he's drawn to his Bridge for some inexplicable reason. Hugh Grant really ought to be looking for a patent for that mojo he works so well. All of the original actors are back as Bridget's parents and her "dating war command" of pals and all have a natural, easy chemistry that works. But, the negatives, they are a-plenty.\n\nBiggest problem here was the complete tone change. In the first film, we were on the ride with Bridget...seeing things through her eyes, groaning as she put her foot in her mouth again and cheering for her to finally get it right. However, in this movie, it feels like someone stuck her up on a stage and spent 2 hours throwing pies and tomatoes at her cause it seemed real cool. She's not in on the joke here, she IS the joke. Her few extra pounds are no longer just a part of the package  they are the end-all of her worth as a person. It feels like the folks behind this film don't even LIKE the character  they just think it's real cool to humiliate her as often as possible. It doesn't even look like they bothered to send Renee to makeup or wardrobe  she (as Bridget) was pleasantly plump in the first film, but never dowdy. The character is downright frumpy in this movie with a perpetual case of bed head and clothes that look like castoffs from Mayberry. And Renee plays into it with her acting choices  Bridget was frazzled in the first movie but still retained her dignity most of the time. She's a perpetual victim in this one, though, and even though Renee is still cute as a button and incredibly endearing, some of Bridget's spark is gone.\n\nWhat happens after the happy ending? Couple realizes that they are each real, flawed people. And the movie makes it seem like Mark is at that point  never tries to change Bridget, never gets angry and her constant mishaps amuse more than annoy. But, as each of Bridget's tantrums unfolded, I kept asking myself why in the WORLD the man was still there. Bridget's keen on him but doesn't trust him. She likes to be with him but is suspicious of his actions without any real cause. Now, we know she's an insecure character and feels like she's not classy enough to fit into his world. And if the movie built from that, maybe we'd have a different story. But the obstacles they face are external. The characters never make decisions on their own  something or someone else makes them feel a certain way or forces them into a course of action that decides what will happen next. And Bridget's reactions almost make it seem like somehow, over the course of the last 'six weeks', she's regressed to a girl in the schoolyard stomping her feet when her boyfriend does something she doesn't like.\n\nAnother problem  the utter lack of subtlety. Why include one fat joke when 3 or 4 plus a butt shot can fit into the scene? Why spend most of the movie dropping hints about a reveal when you can beat the audience over the head with it in one of the final scenes? Why have Daniel make one joke about stealing Mark's wife when he can drop another one 30 minutes later? Oh look, matching Christmas jumpers  how cute. Most of the funny in this movie comes from certain 'episodes' as opposed to the dialogue. I loved the ski trip and Bridget's 'magic mushrooms' in Thailand. But, when the characters are actually talking to each other, they just aren't that funny. Most of the jokes are reruns from the first movie that feel stale. The naughty jokes are kicked up a notch but everyone in my packed theater, including me, either grimaced or sat stone-faced through most of them. Note to filmmakers: dirty has to actually BE funny to be funny.\n\nThis feels like a movie about a woman made by men who think wet clothes, girl-on-girl action and butt close-ups get it done. I read some interviews that said that Renee would only do a second film if it took care of Bridget and held up the standards of the first. I almost wonder if someone slid her this script on the first day of shooting as a rewrite once she'd already signed on the dotted line. This felt like a bleached, harsher version of the first the warmth is gone. I know there was a different director and I really don't think the new kid gets why Bridget was/is such a phenomenon. As much as I was looking forward to this film, I wish they'd never done it.\n\nOh, and also, as a P.S.  if I was a Thai woman right now, I'd be suing Working Title and Miramax for defamation of character for their version of 'Fun with Stereotypes'.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110186,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-12-29","keywords":"thailand,marriage proposal,prison,boyfriend girlfriend relationship,opposites attract","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1468053017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM4MjQzMDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM4MjQzMDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452319/","name":"Beeban Kidron"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276144/","name":"Helen Fielding","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0203577/","name":"Andrew Davies","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

All in all chocolate is a remarkable film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-24","keywords":"chocolate,france,village,food,magical realism","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Chocolat","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2733547033","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRjNGI4MmYtY2U1ZS00N2UzLTk5MzgtMjIxYjlhMDI2NWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDRjNGI4MmYtY2U1ZS00N2UzLTk5MzgtMjIxYjlhMDI2NWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000547/","name":"Alfred Molina"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002120/","name":"Lasse Hallström"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031919/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104130/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0364862/","name":"Joanne Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414608/","name":"Robert Nelson Jacobs"],"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.  \n\n\t Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness.  Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump.  It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music.  (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.)  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones.  Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachable we can relate to her.  \n\nAs Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious.  (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.)  There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw (and I loved) in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' or `Sense and Sensibility.'  Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love.  Yes, it's a paradox, but that is what Grant brings to his role.  He makes being `bad' look so sexy.  You can't take your eyes off him; he brings his own humor to his role.  It's lovely, smoldering, and incredibly sexy. \n\n Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy (I think I might be in love with him, too).  He is also sexy and smoldering, but not in the same wild, fiery way as Daniel Cleaver.  Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role.  I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol, but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen. There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget, `I like you very much just the way you are.'  It's incredibly romantic and, for me, ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's `You complete me' in `Jerry Maguire.' He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger, which is moving and sexy all at the same time.  (And, of course, the author Helen Fielding used Colin Firth as the basis for Mark Darcy, so it all works out marvelously.) \t\n\nI also mentioned that the movie smartly builds on some elements that the book downplays.  Yes, there are certain parts of the movie that cannot be found in the book, but I'm still glad they put them in the movie.  Most of what they added doesn't necessarily build on plot but it does add to the characters.  I don't want to give anything away because it's rather hilarious what unfolds onscreen.  The movie is filmed in an almost Ally McBeal type of way but it remains true to the sincerity, cuteness, and pathetic naivete that Bridget Jones embodies.  There are no pretensions. It's an entirely wonderful film.   10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":233781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-10","keywords":"unfaithfulness,employer employee relationship,opposites attract,love triangle,book publishing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridget Jones's Diary","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi192783897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg4ZGY2MWItNTJlYy00YTE1LTg2ZTAtZGIyNDEzYWYzZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg4ZGY2MWItNTJlYy00YTE1LTg2ZTAtZGIyNDEzYWYzZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bridget Jones's Diary"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536632/","name":"Sharon Maguire"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276144/","name":"Helen Fielding"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0203577/","name":"Andrew Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.  \n\n\t Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness.  Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump.  It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music.  (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.)  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones.  Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachable we can relate to her.  \n\nAs Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious.  (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.)  There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw (and I loved) in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' or `Sense and Sensibility.'  Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love.  Yes, it's a paradox, but that is what Grant brings to his role.  He makes being `bad' look so sexy.  You can't take your eyes off him; he brings his own humor to his role.  It's lovely, smoldering, and incredibly sexy. \n\n Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy (I think I might be in love with him, too).  He is also sexy and smoldering, but not in the same wild, fiery way as Daniel Cleaver.  Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role.  I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol, but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen. There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget, `I like you very much just the way you are.'  It's incredibly romantic and, for me, ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's `You complete me' in `Jerry Maguire.' He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger, which is moving and sexy all at the same time.  (And, of course, the author Helen Fielding used Colin Firth as the basis for Mark Darcy, so it all works out marvelously.) \t\n\nI also mentioned that the movie smartly builds on some elements that the book downplays.  Yes, there are certain parts of the movie that cannot be found in the book, but I'm still glad they put them in the movie.  Most of what they added doesn't necessarily build on plot but it does add to the characters.  I don't want to give anything away because it's rather hilarious what unfolds onscreen.  The movie is filmed in an almost Ally McBeal type of way but it remains true to the sincerity, cuteness, and pathetic naivete that Bridget Jones embodies.  There are no pretensions. It's an entirely wonderful film.   10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":233781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-10","keywords":"unfaithfulness,employer employee relationship,opposites attract,love triangle,book publishing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridget Jones's Diary","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi192783897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg4ZGY2MWItNTJlYy00YTE1LTg2ZTAtZGIyNDEzYWYzZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg4ZGY2MWItNTJlYy00YTE1LTg2ZTAtZGIyNDEzYWYzZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bridget Jones's Diary"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536632/","name":"Sharon Maguire"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276144/","name":"Helen Fielding"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0203577/","name":"Andrew Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Martin Clunes and Dominic Minghella should (and I'm sure do) take intense pride over their creation. The writing is the best in the business, the director Ben Bolt is amazing, and the acting is subtle, natural, hilarious and touching. In addition to Martin Clunes, Caroline Catz has shown herself to be one of the best of her generation. And the scenery and music, of course, are beautiful.\n\nPleeeeeeaaaaaaaase, please, please Mr. and Mrs. Clunes: Don't sell out to us Yanks.

The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. \n\nSandra Oh stands out for her comic timing, but the entire cast is superb. It's not as grave as ER, but is just as compelling. Also, it's a little more accessible than ER and some of the more serious medical dramas. The show is definitely worth catching--if you can't watch it when it airs, TiVo it or rent the first season DVD. It's well worth the time spent! It's great for marathon viewings!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":270305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama. I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The detailed story arc might make it a bit challenging for new viewers to pick up the threads, but each episode stands alone.\n\nLike Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Veronica Mars mixes, humour and pathos, into both complicated life and death issues and high school life. Just as Buffy was about more than surviving high school with a social life, Veronica Mars looks at real things with a sceptical eye and an ironic twist.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69218,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-09-22","keywords":"female protagonist,internal monologue,murder of best friend,bus accident,female detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068338/","name":"Kristen Bell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230655/","name":"Jason Dohring","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170186/","name":"Enrico Colantoni"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020047/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017673/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175100/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859432/","name":"Rob Thomas"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1849539609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Y2U5NWEtMGVhZC00ZTM4LTgzNzUtYTgxM2I1MDY0NTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Y2U5NWEtMGVhZC00ZTM4LTgzNzUtYTgxM2I1MDY0NTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Spring breakers are getting murdered in Neptune, thereby decimating the seaside town's tourist industry.

I was drawn in immediately by the suspense and wondering what was going to happen next.\n\nI can definitely say this one is one on my must watch list. Lots of twists and turns as you go along that keep you interested and wanting to see more. The other characters all do a great job as well. Very well written, and acted.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":105339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-03-30","keywords":"female protagonist,suicide,brainwashed assassin,mad scientist,genetic enhancement","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1137209/","name":"Tatiana Maslany","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1851313/","name":"Dylan Bruce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2849998/","name":"Jordan Gavaris"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069372/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1528935/","name":"Kim Coghill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3784672/","name":"Andrew De Angelis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3709826/","name":"Jeff Detsky"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Orphan Black - Season 3 teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1926017305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMzA2NzgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk3MDIwNTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMzA2NzgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk3MDIwNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sarah comes face to face with a new Castor clone in this sneak peek of Episode 1, which premieres Saturday, April 18th at 9/8c on BBC America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Buy the 1st Season DVD","reviewBody":"ER in its present, 2003 form is a schizophrenic mess. For every one intelligent, caring episode comes four or five exercises in downbeat, melodramatic soap opera which sap all the energy out of the show's still-present technical mastery. This four-disc set is a welcome flashback to the show's humble beginnings, when it wasn't supposed to be the most heart-pounding show on television, and succeeded on will, not on hype.\n\nThe central characters in the first season are Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), ER Residents Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) and pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney), Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), Surgical Resident Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq la Salle) and his protégé, third-year med student John Carter (Noah Wyle, the only actor to remain on the show through the entire run). They brought a fresh edge to the oft-repeated world of medical drama, helped greatly by the first television show, in my estimation, to ever put actual intelligence into the presentation. On ER, the cameras move, the people move, the consistent hustle and bustle of an actual environment is palpable, and not simply a setpiece. It's interesting to note that although the show was never broadcast in widescreen until 2001, in the middle of it's seventh season, these first episodes are all presented in the wider format. At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.\n\nStandout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.\n\nThe show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism. This is exaggerated a little, but still a valid point; rarely an episode goes by without something in the line of an unexpected pregnancy, a suicide attempt, a violent skirmish between doctor and patient, or (in one outrageous case) a 12-year old gang member brining his Glock into a trauma room to try and finish another 12-year old off. Still, the show displayed remarkable resilience in almost always rising to become greater than the sum of its parts. Naturally, that ability has waned and virtually disappeared, but these episodes are no less enjoyable as a result of that.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1994-09-19","keywords":"hospital,emergency room,sleeping,medical care,medical doctor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000381/","name":"Anthony Edwards","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000523/","name":"Julianna Margulies"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093758/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037310/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Er: Season 15","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2463087897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Er: Season 15"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

How in the world can three quarters of the main cast be just nixed like that? Something more than people just "moving on" to better things is going on, I think.\n\nYeah, Reuben's character can be written off easily based on the season one finale, but dropping Machado and McDermott like lead balloons is very sketchy. Even the storyline for Reuben was a stretch since there was a sub-plot pertaining to her personal life (ie. Rick Fox guest-starring) that was developing.\n\nI enjoyed season one immensely because the acting was believable, the chemistry was there, and the writing/directing was top-notch. I'll give season two a chance with new-comers Vivica A. Fox and the rest, but when there are major changes to an already quality cast, usually it's not for the better. We shall see.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1291,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2003-08-02","keywords":"fbi federal bureau of investigation,female protagonist,scene before opening credits,law enforcement,vision","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0778741/","name":"Caterina Scorsone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000407/","name":"Vivica A.

It's not bad!","reviewBody":"It's not the greatest medical drama and does not compare to ER as far as realism goes but as a nurse most of the medical stuff is correct and every show gets stuff wrong so don't not like a medical show because it's not 100% accurate. \n\nI like that they have taken this show on from a different angle - money and corruption! I don't live in the USA but I imagine this is actually quite accurate in the way hospitals are run and that it is all about money and not necessarily doing what's best for the patient. \n\nThe characters so far are interesting - I'm 7 episodes in and I like that some patients are in it for longer than an episode. There are characters you want to root for the do gooders and there are characters you love to hate who are selfish, rich and really in the wrong business. Oh and there's a main character that's a nurse which is always a plus since we basically make the hospitals run! \n\nSo if you like medical dramas give it a go! I've seen them all - ER is the best, I've got a soft spot for Greys Anatomy even though sometimes it's ridiculous m, Code Black is great, Chicago Med is alright, The night shift was good. They are all entertaining so in my mind they do what they are suppose to!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21065,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-21","keywords":"two word title,atlanta georgia,georgia,hospital,medical","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194516/","name":"Matt Czuchry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2110485/","name":"Manish Dayal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339304/","name":"Bruce Greenwood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152181/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0683032/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427468/","name":"Amy Holden Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2735698/","name":"Hayley Schore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6149734/","name":"Roshan Sethi"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 1 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi528529689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RjODYyNTMtZTljZC00ZmViLWEzZmYtZjExNmM2Y2I2MTQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RjODYyNTMtZTljZC00ZmViLWEzZmYtZjExNmM2Y2I2MTQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Resident" follows Dr. Conrad Hawkins, one of the best doctors at Chastain Park Memorial Hospital.
