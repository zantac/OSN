This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15651,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.\n\nThe thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.\n\nAlso all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).\n\nThe reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. \n\n9 out of 10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-09-20","keywords":"shared universe,ampersand in title,punctuation in title,sexually motivated,sexually motivated assault","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002127/","name":"Mariska Hargitay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005221/","name":"Christopher Meloni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001384/","name":"Ice-T"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069685/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080319/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3079995673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

S. society, American values, white America, etc. Every story throws new shade on the FBI and/or the USA as a nation, or American culture.\n\nI have never seen any of the FBI agents say, "Wow that guy was just plain evil," unless it was a white Anglo who was (always) a racist, Neo-Nazi, white supremacist, etc. The message of this show is that white people are evil, and everyone else, including the criminals, are victims of "White America." I am not white, and I find this show incredibly disturbing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11503,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

 --- Description: Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit: Created by Dick Wolf. With Mariska Hargitay, Ice-T, Dann Florek, Richard Belzer. This series follows the Special Victims Unit, a specially trained squad of detectives in the N.Y.P.D., who investigate sexually related crimes." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt0203259/","name":"Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNlNjcwNGItOWRkNi00MzI0LTg3OGMtYzdjZDA4YmU4M2U1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODUxOTU0OTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"This series follows the Special Victims Unit, a specially trained squad of detectives in the N.Y.P.D., who investigate sexually related crimes.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0203259/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"stamper","dateCreated":"2005-01-25","inLanguage":"English","name":"Maybe the best crime-series at the moment and very underrated I feel","reviewBody":"When I am communicating with other people interested in crime series it is remarkable how many people seem to watch either CSI or CSI: Miami or both. Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.\n\nThe thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.\n\nAlso all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).\n\nThe reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. \n\n9 out of 10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-09-20","keywords":"shared universe,ampersand in title,punctuation in title,sexually motivated,sexually motivated assault","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002127/","name":"Mariska Hargitay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005221/","name":"Christopher Meloni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001384/","name":"Ice-T"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069685/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080319/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3079995673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.\n\nThe thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.\n\nAlso all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).\n\nThe reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. \n\n9 out of 10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-09-20","keywords":"shared universe,ampersand in title,punctuation in title,sexually motivated,sexually motivated assault","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002127/","name":"Mariska Hargitay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005221/","name":"Christopher Meloni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001384/","name":"Ice-T"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069685/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080319/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3079995673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Past mid-point I started to ask myself when it would truly begin, for the story never felt intriguing to me, neither did the characters (although there were one or two scenes with Johnny Deep that were enjoyable). By the end of it I had to search for an explanation of the movie, on the internet, since I was convinced that I had missed some key elements somewhere; but no, to my big surprise I seemingly managed to stay focused enough to catch it all. So what is there to this movie?\n\nIn my opinion, it's very focused on delivering a message, so much that it takes away from what could have been at least somewhat of an interesting story; the message itself is clear not long after the beginning of the movie and once you get it, you've had it all.\n\nAnd what about my interest in history? Well, the movie takes place in "the Empire" and the soldiers came from "the capital", more than that I don't know. Some more action could've helped a little, but no, there's barely any action either to save it. You are in for a slow-paced movie, with a weak story and decent acting, trying to deliver a message.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8828,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-01-06","keywords":"loyalty,judge,screenplay adapted by author,barbarian","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2417147417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MmEzYTktYjRmOS00OWNmLTgxMmYtOGNlN2QwNmZhODYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MmEzYTktYjRmOS00OWNmLTgxMmYtOGNlN2QwNmZhODYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Magistrate of an isolated frontier settlement on the border of an unnamed empire looks forward to an easy retirement until the arrival of Colonel Joll, whose task it is to report on the activities of the "barbarians" and on the security situation on the border."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1458734/","name":"Ciro Guerra"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362409/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0200829/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168792/","name":"J.M.

Past mid-point I started to ask myself when it would truly begin, for the story never felt intriguing to me, neither did the characters (although there were one or two scenes with Johnny Deep that were enjoyable). By the end of it I had to search for an explanation of the movie, on the internet, since I was convinced that I had missed some key elements somewhere; but no, to my big surprise I seemingly managed to stay focused enough to catch it all. So what is there to this movie?\n\nIn my opinion, it's very focused on delivering a message, so much that it takes away from what could have been at least somewhat of an interesting story; the message itself is clear not long after the beginning of the movie and once you get it, you've had it all.\n\nAnd what about my interest in history? Well, the movie takes place in "the Empire" and the soldiers came from "the capital", more than that I don't know. Some more action could've helped a little, but no, there's barely any action either to save it. You are in for a slow-paced movie, with a weak story and decent acting, trying to deliver a message.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8828,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-01-06","keywords":"loyalty,judge,screenplay adapted by author,barbarian","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2417147417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MmEzYTktYjRmOS00OWNmLTgxMmYtOGNlN2QwNmZhODYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MmEzYTktYjRmOS00OWNmLTgxMmYtOGNlN2QwNmZhODYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Magistrate of an isolated frontier settlement on the border of an unnamed empire looks forward to an easy retirement until the arrival of Colonel Joll, whose task it is to report on the activities of the "barbarians" and on the security situation on the border.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1458734/","name":"Ciro Guerra"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362409/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0200829/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168792/","name":"J.M.

This time he has his mind set on changing his broken down life, but that is easier said than done.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0396184/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"nesfilmreviews"},"dateCreated":"2014-11-09","inLanguage":"English","name":"Refn and Mikkelsen are in top form.","reviewBody":"After Refn made an unsuccessful English-language debut with 2003's "Fear X," he returned to Denmark to shoot parts two and three of "The Pusher Trilogy." But the new films aren't a continuation, and the layoff didn't dull Refn's ability to tell an engaging crime story. In "Pusher 2: With Blood On My Hands," the film explores a drug-dealer's former sidekick as he deals with new challenges in the world of crime, drugs, and becoming a father.\n\nFrank's ex-sidekick from the first film, Tonny, wonderfully played by Mads Mikkelsen is fresh out of prison. Tonny is eager to prove his worth as earner and son to his crime boss father (Leif Sylvester Petersen), known as the Duke. Routinely called a loser by everyone he knows -- he practically invites abuse by sporting a tattooed "respect" on the back of his bald head. Tonny also tries to ingratiate himself with his recalcitrant father (Leif Sylvester Petersen), who can hardly trust him with anything. The back-breaking straw is the appearance of a baby that Tonny's old non-girlfriend (Anne Sorensen) claims is his. The bitterness and betrayal mounts as Tonny begins to wonder if he should rewrite his life, and the fate of the neglected infant.\n\nAt its core, the film about is about broken families and serves as a stark reminder of the lasting effects on our actions can have on future generations. Tonny's entire life has been spent on only one thing: trying to gain the approval of his father. And not only that he learns on his release that he is very likely the father of a baby boy, one so neglected by his junkie mother that he hasn't even been given a name yet. Refn is painting a bleak picture of a child without a chance. He is in complete control behind the camera, but this film belongs purely and simply to Mikkelsen. He is absolutely stunning, flawlessly embodying the insecurities and desire that drives Tonny. Against all odds, Tonny becomes a sympathetic hero in an increasingly tragic tale.

But the new films aren't a continuation, and the layoff didn't dull Refn's ability to tell an engaging crime story. In "Pusher 2: With Blood On My Hands," the film explores a drug-dealer's former sidekick as he deals with new challenges in the world of crime, drugs, and becoming a father.\n\nFrank's ex-sidekick from the first film, Tonny, wonderfully played by Mads Mikkelsen is fresh out of prison. Tonny is eager to prove his worth as earner and son to his crime boss father (Leif Sylvester Petersen), known as the Duke. Routinely called a loser by everyone he knows -- he practically invites abuse by sporting a tattooed "respect" on the back of his bald head. Tonny also tries to ingratiate himself with his recalcitrant father (Leif Sylvester Petersen), who can hardly trust him with anything. The back-breaking straw is the appearance of a baby that Tonny's old non-girlfriend (Anne Sorensen) claims is his. The bitterness and betrayal mounts as Tonny begins to wonder if he should rewrite his life, and the fate of the neglected infant.\n\nAt its core, the film about is about broken families and serves as a stark reminder of the lasting effects on our actions can have on future generations. Tonny's entire life has been spent on only one thing: trying to gain the approval of his father. And not only that he learns on his release that he is very likely the father of a baby boy, one so neglected by his junkie mother that he hasn't even been given a name yet. Refn is painting a bleak picture of a child without a chance. He is in complete control behind the camera, but this film belongs purely and simply to Mikkelsen. He is absolutely stunning, flawlessly embodying the insecurities and desire that drives Tonny. Against all odds, Tonny becomes a sympathetic hero in an increasingly tragic tale.

The film expressively reminds the world once again about the illicit affair between Caroline Mathilde (Alicia Vikander), the beautiful Queen of Denmark, and the enlightened, German-born physician named Johann Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen). In all its courtly essence, A Royal Affair presents this 18th century tale with utmost thoroughness, adding huge amounts of tension to its naturalistic substance with every following minute. While it's mostly recognized for the meaningful romantic overtone, this film presents much more than that, even though the star-crossed lovers prove to have the biggest impact on the unexpected turn of events. \n\nIt starts very similarly to Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, with a young princess bound to marry a king she doesn't even know, through the old-fashioned way of a royal transaction. Right after the Queen finally sets her lovely eyes on the mysterious husband-to-be one thing is certain – there is something wrong with his majestic appearance. Christian VII (Mikkel Boe Følsgaard) giggles nervously, and is more interested in greeting his own dog than the woman, with whom he will probably (but not likely) spend the rest of his palace life. Right after the both absolutely awkward and truly humorous announcement of King's nightly visit in his wife's bedroom, and Caroline's anxiously awaited pregnancy, it becomes perfectly clear that the pair won't present itself in the expected, regal way. Those two characters don't even intend to give the appearance of being fully in love with each other. The king wanders angrily around the luxurious chambers making fun of everyone, not knowing that he ostentatiously presents all of his biggest weaknesses. At the same time, the Queen spends most of her time with the newborn baby. When Christian proclaims his forthcoming trip around Europe nobody realizes that big and sudden changes are about to happen. During the journey King's mental illness becomes worse. He needs a private doctor and he needs him quick. This is the moment when Johan Struensee first shows his handsome face. Apart from his unquestionable medical abilities, he proves to be a great admirer of the Enlightenment movement's greatest thinkers and their innovative works, and that's what makes him an ideal partner for the King. After returning to the country, their companionship grows stronger every day. Unfortunately, so does Johan's affection towards Queen's awe-inspiring persona. After a while, it becomes awfully obvious that they won't be able to suppress their deepest urges and a risky romance will soon take place, one that might actually begin a new era in the history of Denmark. Scheming behind the back of the wig-wearing, ignorant council, Caroline and Struensee use the gullible King for the sake of a greater good – they create many new and reformative laws, and using Christian's powerful, yet unstable hand they end up improving the whole land and its citizens' life, rushing Denmark towards the desired Enlightenment.\n\nAs history so often shows, when there is the optimistic, hard-working side there must also be the pessimistic, mischievous one. In A Royal Affair, it takes the form of an ominous, recalcitrant aristocrat named Ove Høegh-Guldberg (David Dencik). Conspiring along with Christian's stepmother Juliane Marie (Trine Dyrholm) he comes up with a perfect plan to get rid of the unwanted German and, at the same time, bring back Denmark's old 'glory'. Revealing the shocking truth about Queen being pregnant with Struensee he wreaks havoc among the society. The return of the Dark Ages is upon Denmark, and no one is able to stop this devastating process, as the King gave in to Ove's strong and convincing character, and, ultimately, to his own illness. Johann and Caroline are banished from the Kingdom, just to see that, sadly, their thorough plan wasn't actually meant to help anyone.\n\nWith its splendidly high entertainment value, A Royal Affair turns out to be a history lesson for everyone. Considerable attention to details in plot and in art design brings out the true substance of the film. The costumes are pitch-perfect, the music flows adequately to the events, and the ongoing transition in the atmosphere intensifies the reception of the whole. A Royal Affair possesses a great energy, which shows its true strength in all the performances. Without offending anyone from the amazing cast, it's important to note that Mads Mikkelsen gave the most award-worthy performance, showing the straightforwardly persuasive impassiveness that may really convince his fans and anti-fans alike. Therefore, those irrefutable acting skills, combined with a well-written script and steady direction, make A Royal Affair one of the most memorable Danish movies of the last decade.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45765,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2012-03-29","keywords":"infidelity,insanity,denmark,enlightenment,sex in public","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1020634393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzcyOTg0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg3NzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzcyOTg0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg3NzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young queen, who is married to an insane king, falls secretly in love with her physician - and together they start a revolution that changes a nation forever.

The film expressively reminds the world once again about the illicit affair between Caroline Mathilde (Alicia Vikander), the beautiful Queen of Denmark, and the enlightened, German-born physician named Johann Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen). In all its courtly essence, A Royal Affair presents this 18th century tale with utmost thoroughness, adding huge amounts of tension to its naturalistic substance with every following minute. While it's mostly recognized for the meaningful romantic overtone, this film presents much more than that, even though the star-crossed lovers prove to have the biggest impact on the unexpected turn of events. \n\nIt starts very similarly to Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, with a young princess bound to marry a king she doesn't even know, through the old-fashioned way of a royal transaction. Right after the Queen finally sets her lovely eyes on the mysterious husband-to-be one thing is certain – there is something wrong with his majestic appearance. Christian VII (Mikkel Boe Følsgaard) giggles nervously, and is more interested in greeting his own dog than the woman, with whom he will probably (but not likely) spend the rest of his palace life. Right after the both absolutely awkward and truly humorous announcement of King's nightly visit in his wife's bedroom, and Caroline's anxiously awaited pregnancy, it becomes perfectly clear that the pair won't present itself in the expected, regal way. Those two characters don't even intend to give the appearance of being fully in love with each other. The king wanders angrily around the luxurious chambers making fun of everyone, not knowing that he ostentatiously presents all of his biggest weaknesses. At the same time, the Queen spends most of her time with the newborn baby. When Christian proclaims his forthcoming trip around Europe nobody realizes that big and sudden changes are about to happen. During the journey King's mental illness becomes worse. He needs a private doctor and he needs him quick. This is the moment when Johan Struensee first shows his handsome face. Apart from his unquestionable medical abilities, he proves to be a great admirer of the Enlightenment movement's greatest thinkers and their innovative works, and that's what makes him an ideal partner for the King. After returning to the country, their companionship grows stronger every day. Unfortunately, so does Johan's affection towards Queen's awe-inspiring persona. After a while, it becomes awfully obvious that they won't be able to suppress their deepest urges and a risky romance will soon take place, one that might actually begin a new era in the history of Denmark. Scheming behind the back of the wig-wearing, ignorant council, Caroline and Struensee use the gullible King for the sake of a greater good – they create many new and reformative laws, and using Christian's powerful, yet unstable hand they end up improving the whole land and its citizens' life, rushing Denmark towards the desired Enlightenment.\n\nAs history so often shows, when there is the optimistic, hard-working side there must also be the pessimistic, mischievous one. In A Royal Affair, it takes the form of an ominous, recalcitrant aristocrat named Ove Høegh-Guldberg (David Dencik). Conspiring along with Christian's stepmother Juliane Marie (Trine Dyrholm) he comes up with a perfect plan to get rid of the unwanted German and, at the same time, bring back Denmark's old 'glory'. Revealing the shocking truth about Queen being pregnant with Struensee he wreaks havoc among the society. The return of the Dark Ages is upon Denmark, and no one is able to stop this devastating process, as the King gave in to Ove's strong and convincing character, and, ultimately, to his own illness. Johann and Caroline are banished from the Kingdom, just to see that, sadly, their thorough plan wasn't actually meant to help anyone.\n\nWith its splendidly high entertainment value, A Royal Affair turns out to be a history lesson for everyone. Considerable attention to details in plot and in art design brings out the true substance of the film. The costumes are pitch-perfect, the music flows adequately to the events, and the ongoing transition in the atmosphere intensifies the reception of the whole. A Royal Affair possesses a great energy, which shows its true strength in all the performances. Without offending anyone from the amazing cast, it's important to note that Mads Mikkelsen gave the most award-worthy performance, showing the straightforwardly persuasive impassiveness that may really convince his fans and anti-fans alike. Therefore, those irrefutable acting skills, combined with a well-written script and steady direction, make A Royal Affair one of the most memorable Danish movies of the last decade.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45765,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2012-03-29","keywords":"infidelity,insanity,denmark,enlightenment,sex in public","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1020634393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzcyOTg0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg3NzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzcyOTg0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg3NzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young queen, who is married to an insane king, falls secretly in love with her physician - and together they start a revolution that changes a nation forever.

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Rent "Senna", unless you're an Irish Moto fan.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1371,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"genre":["Documentary","Sport"],"datePublished":"2014-06-11","keywords":"northern irish man,motorcycle,motorcycle racer,success story,professional sportsman","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6932382/","name":"Liam Beckett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7373710/","name":"Siobhan Carter"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1353999/","name":"Michael Hewitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1254619/","name":"Dermot Lavery"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104999/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0851632/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1254619/","name":"Dermot Lavery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1353999/","name":"Michael Hewitt"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

By the final episode of given up and lost patience.\n\nNesbitt was awful throughout. His facial expressions were so cliché and he over acted everything.

Debbie Reynolds is kind of at her best, for me, less trivial than she is sometimes portrayed. She doesn't dance or sing, but is just a girl trying to make it in New York. Throw in Don Rickles at an exaggerated but believable role, with less humor and more grotesqueness. Finally, though big sax man Gerry Mulligan gets big letters in the credits, he appears, as himself, only briefly (though we do get to hear him play for a few seconds).\n\nBut let's turn this around and talk plot. In a very broad way, this is a kind of "Breakfast at Tiffany's" a year earlier. Nice guy lands in New York without a clue and local woman is braving it on her own and having to compromise her principles in the process. Even the music, by Elmer Bernstein, is in a Henry Mancini style (only rarely dipping into any real jazz, for those looking for that). Though painted as a story of boy meets girl and the improbable follows the unlikely, the basic premise is heartwarming and true to a lot of our dreams of making it, and making it with the right person (both).\n\nI liked this movie a lot. It's even photographed by Alfred Hitchcock's cinematographer, Robert Burks, and so it looks good, too, in mildly widescreen Technicolor. It's a situation drama/comedy--there is no sensing that this is actually real. In that sense it's really a 1960 era movie, when artifice had reached a truly plastic kind of height (sometimes with wonderful results, but even classics like, say, "West Side Story" have a style from the times that is neither classic 1940s Hollywood in its believability nor totally creative invention as with those rare movies here and there all through the decades). The point is, you have to like this kind of set-up style to start with. You probably know whether movies like some of the Doris Day classics or even Marilyn Monroe movies are up your alley. \n\nOr "Breakfast at Tiffany's," or the black and white counterpart in a different sense, "The Apartment." I think this Curtis/Reynolds romantic comedy is totally overlooked, and deserves a close look. There are ever some fabulous if fleeting shots of busy New York City. And if you've never heard of the director, Robert Mulligan (no relation to Gerry), don't worry. He did pull off one all time classic handled with similar panache--"To Kill a Mockingbird."

He's nowadays as sheriff , Marshal Chris Adams , who turns down a friend's request to help stop the depredations of a band of Mexican bandits , but then his spouse (Mariette Hartley) has been kidnapped by a gang . When his wife is abducted by bank thieves and his friend is murdered capturing the last outlaw , Chris feels obligated to take up his partner's cause . Then Chris along with a journalist (Michael Callan) set off in pursuit bandit gunfighters (Gary Busey among them) , as he recruits five prisoners to track down the desperadoes . Besides , Chris helping his buddy (Ralph Waite) must free a Mexican village (inhabited by women as Stefanie Powers , among others) besieged by nasty outlaws who are devastating the small location . Lee van Cleef is decided to take a group of prisoners and strike a blow against the Mexican bandits . He goes to Tucson Territorial Prison where a bunch of misfits , murderers , robbers , rapists and other prisoners (with a TV star-studded cast such as Pedro Armendariz , Luke Askew, William Lucking, Ed Lauter, and James B. Sikking ) get a chance to redeem themselves . As Chris recruits various Magnificent Men and once again defending hapless people from their oppressors . As a brand of new seven , doing their number , they put their lives on the line and let it ride . \n\nThe last in the original series of four ¨The Magnificent Seven¨ movies , here Lee Van Cleef as Chris , substituting Yul Brynner , who played the role in two occasions , and one performed by George Kennedy . Yul Brynner insisted he would only make the sequels if Steve McQueen was not involved , McQueen felt the plot was too absurd and for this, and other reasons, was not interested anyway . Van Cleef as a two-fisted avenger sheriff is good as well as his role of ¨Sabata¨, meanwhile Yul Brynner left the Chris character for playing the ¨Cleef's Sabata¨ role in ¨Indio Black¨ . The story is similar to previous entries , adding ¨Dirty dozen¨ wake , including customary outlaw band formed by an eclectic gang with diverse speciality , as dynamite or guns . The film gets action Western , exciting riding, shootouts, it's funny and entertaining , although nothing new but displays a television style . The movie contains some moment of grisly violence and even touching on the relationships between the women and the Magnificent . This is a drab , inferior sequel from the original and enduringly popular ¨The magnificent seven¨ (John Sturges,1960) that is equally remake to ¨The seven samurais¨ (in fact , it was Yul Brynner who approached producer Walter Mirisch with the idea of doing a Western adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's classic) . After that , followed ¨The return of the seven¨(Burt Kennedy,1966), again with Brynner and ¨Guns of the magnificent seven¨ (Paul Wendkos,1969) with George Kennedy and continued with a TV series and a Television movie realized in 1998 . As always , breathtaking and memorable musical score by the great Elmer Berstein. Elmer , whose score for the series is one of the best-known ever composed , also wrote the soundtrack for the parody of this film, 'Three amigos'. Appropriate cinematography by expert cameraman Fred J. Koenekamp (Patton, The inferno towering, Papillon) . The motion picture was regularly directed by George McCowan , a usual TV episodes director (Charlie's Angels , Banacek , Cannon , Starsky and Hutch) .

This was the first time John Wayne and Robert Mitchum had co-starred in a western, and the result was good, solid western entertainment.  One wishes it could have happened again.\n\nThe Duke plays Cole Thorton, a gunman, who has been hired by a land baron in Texas to assist in taking over some much-needed water land, and, if necessary, put an end to interference that the sheriff, played by Mitchum, would offer.  Unbeknownst to the land baron, Thorton and J.P.Harrah are friends from the war, and Thorton decides to ride away from the job.\n\nA few months later, Thorton returns to El Dorado to warn Harrah that a new threat will be coming to the town, and he finds that the sheriff has become the town drunk, due to a fouled-up romance.  Thorton now has to help J. P. get his skill back, prevent the range war from busting out, while keeping a young sidekick, Mississippi, played by James Caan, alive and healthy.  There is also a good performance turned in by Arthur Hunnicutt, as Bull, J.P.'s deputy who stands by the sheriff, even in times of drunken sprees.\n\nThere are some similar elements to other Wayne films, notably "Rio Bravo" and "Rio Lobo", but the chance to watch two big stars work off each other, makes this one easy to take.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25421,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Drama","Romance","Western"],"datePublished":"1967-06-30","keywords":"alcoholic,sonora mexico,two gun holster,double gun holster,one armed gunfighter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3573726745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjBmYTdjZWUtNDQ3OC00OTk2LTkxYmQtYzlmYjUxYjg1YmJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjBmYTdjZWUtNDQ3OC00OTk2LTkxYmQtYzlmYjUxYjg1YmJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000078/","name":"John Wayne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000053/","name":"Robert Mitchum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001001/","name":"James Caan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001328/","name":"Howard Hawks"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072560/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102824/","name":"Leigh Brackett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0113689/","name":"Harry Brown"}],"duration":"PT2H6M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This was the first time John Wayne and Robert Mitchum had co-starred in a western, and the result was good, solid western entertainment.  One wishes it could have happened again.\n\nThe Duke plays Cole Thorton, a gunman, who has been hired by a land baron in Texas to assist in taking over some much-needed water land, and, if necessary, put an end to interference that the sheriff, played by Mitchum, would offer.  Unbeknownst to the land baron, Thorton and J.P.Harrah are friends from the war, and Thorton decides to ride away from the job.\n\nA few months later, Thorton returns to El Dorado to warn Harrah that a new threat will be coming to the town, and he finds that the sheriff has become the town drunk, due to a fouled-up romance.  Thorton now has to help J. P. get his skill back, prevent the range war from busting out, while keeping a young sidekick, Mississippi, played by James Caan, alive and healthy.  There is also a good performance turned in by Arthur Hunnicutt, as Bull, J.P.'s deputy who stands by the sheriff, even in times of drunken sprees.\n\nThere are some similar elements to other Wayne films, notably "Rio Bravo" and "Rio Lobo", but the chance to watch two big stars work off each other, makes this one easy to take.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25421,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Drama","Romance","Western"],"datePublished":"1967-06-30","keywords":"alcoholic,sonora mexico,two gun holster,double gun holster,one armed gunfighter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3573726745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjBmYTdjZWUtNDQ3OC00OTk2LTkxYmQtYzlmYjUxYjg1YmJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjBmYTdjZWUtNDQ3OC00OTk2LTkxYmQtYzlmYjUxYjg1YmJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000078/","name":"John Wayne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000053/","name":"Robert Mitchum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001001/","name":"James Caan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001328/","name":"Howard Hawks"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072560/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102824/","name":"Leigh Brackett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0113689/","name":"Harry Brown"],"duration":"PT2H6M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Fellini was instrumental in creating this magnificent movie about con men that operated in Italy in the years that followed the end of WWII.

His conscience begins to bother him because he realizes the evil of his ways.\n\nThe other best sequence in the film involves the party at Vargas' house where the swindlers have been invited to celebrate the arrival of the new year. We watch as Iris, Picasso's wife, realizes what her husband and the others are really up to. Roberto, the ladies' man, steals the gold cigarette case, not realizing that he is at the home of another con man and his actions will not go unnoticed, but even the embarrassment he goes through in front of the guests will make him give up his life.\n\n"Il Bidone" is a fine example of the Italian cinema of those years as it shows an artist of the caliber of Federico Fellini in top form.

Not alive, anyway."","reviewBody":"Director Billy Wilder was certainly no stranger to the horrors of World War Two. He was born in Austria-Hungary {now Poland} in 1906, but moved to Berlin to begin a career in movies. However, following the rise of Adolf Hitler, Wilder  being Jewish  fled for Paris and then the United States. His mother, grandmother and stepfather died at the Auschwitz concentration camp. As such, I think it'd be safe to presume that Wilder housed a considerable hatred towards Nazis, which makes his POW-picture, 'Stalag 17 (1953),' all the more remarkable. Whereas the film might have developed into a bleak, depressing drama, the screenplay by Wilder and Edwin Blum {adapted from a play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski} effortlessly blends drama and comedy, clearing the path for other similarly-themed war-time films {David Lean's 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' and John Sturges' 'The Great Escape (1963)'} and even TV series {'Hogan's Heroes (1965-1971)' clearly used Wilder's film as a template  including an identical Sgt. Schulz  despite a failed court case in which producers sued for infringement}.\n\nThe year is 1944, in the week before Christmas. Stalag 17, a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, is situated somewhere along the Danube River, and hundreds of captured Allied sergeants have been imprisoned there. The Americans of Barrack 4 endure a dull, deprived lifestyle, with each day consisting of unwholesome meals, tedious labour and uncomfortable living conditions. Displaying that typical American cleverness and resourcefulness, many of the prisoners have banded together to ensure themselves a few added luxuries  such a makeshift radio to listen to the latest war news  and to build an effective escape tunnel beneath the camp. However, it soon becomes apparent that there is a Nazi spy within their midst. After two escaping prisoners are immediately shot down, and their escape passage is inexplicably discovered, the men turn their suspicions towards J.J. Sefton (William Holden), a selfish and arrogant prisoner with a dog-eat-dog mentality that sees him openly bribing the German guards for luxuries. An unsympathetic character, one who nonetheless exhibits a certain streak of integrity, Sefton decides to uncover the true traitor of Barrack 4.\n\nThough he was reluctant to play such an unlikable character, Holden won the Best Actor Oscar for his powerful performance {via the second-shortest acceptance speech in Academy Awards history  a simple "thank you"}. The other actors in the film also create distinct and likable personalities, and I particularly enjoyed the big, oafish Animal (Robert Strauss) and Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck). Goodness knows what compelled the writers to make Sgt. Schulz (Sig Ruman), a loathsome tyrant in any other film, a jolly and hearty buffoon, but it works absolutely perfectly, his character's incompetence best highlighted in the sequence where he is distracted into playing volleyball, and enjoys the game so much that he hands his loaded weapon to the nearest POW. As Sefton attempts to uncover which fellow prisoner is leaving secret messages for their Nazis captors, Wilder intersperses the drama with an episodic flow of comedic situations, placing particularly emphasis on the means by which prisoners will alleviate their desire for the opposite sex. A hilarious sequence sees the drunken Animal mistaking his dressed-up bunk-mate for the cinema beauty Betty Grable, of whom he has an undying obsession.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1953-06-06","keywords":"prisoner of war camp,world war two,nazi,betting,diversionary tactic","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2917842969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjZkMGI5ZGEtYTNjYy00ZTQxLWFjZGEtMmRhNTljYmFiZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjZkMGI5ZGEtYTNjYy00ZTQxLWFjZGEtMmRhNTljYmFiZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000034/","name":"William Holden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852279/","name":"Don Taylor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695937/","name":"Otto Preminger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089637/","name":"Edwin Blum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0079654/","name":"Donald Bevan"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Whereas the film might have developed into a bleak, depressing drama, the screenplay by Wilder and Edwin Blum adapted from a play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski effortlessly blends drama and comedy, clearing the path for other similarly-themed war-time films David Lean's 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' and John Sturges' 'The Great Escape (1963)' and even TV series 'Hogan's Heroes (1965-1971)' clearly used Wilder's film as a template  including an identical Sgt. Schulz  despite a failed court case in which producers sued for infringement.\n\nThe year is 1944, in the week before Christmas. Stalag 17, a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, is situated somewhere along the Danube River, and hundreds of captured Allied sergeants have been imprisoned there. The Americans of Barrack 4 endure a dull, deprived lifestyle, with each day consisting of unwholesome meals, tedious labour and uncomfortable living conditions. Displaying that typical American cleverness and resourcefulness, many of the prisoners have banded together to ensure themselves a few added luxuries  such a makeshift radio to listen to the latest war news  and to build an effective escape tunnel beneath the camp. However, it soon becomes apparent that there is a Nazi spy within their midst. After two escaping prisoners are immediately shot down, and their escape passage is inexplicably discovered, the men turn their suspicions towards J.J. Sefton (William Holden), a selfish and arrogant prisoner with a dog-eat-dog mentality that sees him openly bribing the German guards for luxuries. An unsympathetic character, one who nonetheless exhibits a certain streak of integrity, Sefton decides to uncover the true traitor of Barrack 4.\n\nThough he was reluctant to play such an unlikable character, Holden won the Best Actor Oscar for his powerful performance via the second-shortest acceptance speech in Academy Awards history  a simple "thank you". The other actors in the film also create distinct and likable personalities, and I particularly enjoyed the big, oafish Animal (Robert Strauss) and Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck). Goodness knows what compelled the writers to make Sgt. Schulz (Sig Ruman), a loathsome tyrant in any other film, a jolly and hearty buffoon, but it works absolutely perfectly, his character's incompetence best highlighted in the sequence where he is distracted into playing volleyball, and enjoys the game so much that he hands his loaded weapon to the nearest POW. As Sefton attempts to uncover which fellow prisoner is leaving secret messages for their Nazis captors, Wilder intersperses the drama with an episodic flow of comedic situations, placing particularly emphasis on the means by which prisoners will alleviate their desire for the opposite sex. A hilarious sequence sees the drunken Animal mistaking his dressed-up bunk-mate for the cinema beauty Betty Grable, of whom he has an undying obsession.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1953-06-06","keywords":"prisoner of war camp,world war two,nazi,betting,diversionary tactic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2917842969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjZkMGI5ZGEtYTNjYy00ZTQxLWFjZGEtMmRhNTljYmFiZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjZkMGI5ZGEtYTNjYy00ZTQxLWFjZGEtMmRhNTljYmFiZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000034/","name":"William Holden","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852279/","name":"Don Taylor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695937/","name":"Otto Preminger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089637/","name":"Edwin Blum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0079654/","name":"Donald Bevan"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's a magnificent film, recreating the known offensive by Nazi Panzer tanks on the Belgian front during 1944-45 .What happened during those desperate days that could have changed the course of war is now history . It's well recreated by Ken Annakin for Warner Bros, in Cinerama production with Technicolor cinematography by Jack Hildyard. The producer, Milton Sperling was well-qualified for his job but he was a marine officer and he had 10 combat cameramen, covering three battles during the war and made three documentaries out of those events. Sperling tells that making this film recalled his owns experiences in the war and made it quite possible for the sound effects you heard today to be as realistic as those he heard when was listening to them whining overhead.The making was a logistical problem as almost that of setting up a campaign and putting a film together under any circumstances was very difficult because working under very bad weather conditions. So this whole film was put together, photographed and edited, scored and prepared for release in a matter of about eight months. We scoured Europe,there are places where such tanks do exist,sometimes in junkyards, sometimes in existing armies and just by chance, one finds a cache of tanks, guns,old planes and various other relics .The equipment managed to assemble these great numbers of tanks after looking about for months and months. So what we see on the screen are truly the Tiger tanks that were fought in the battle and the Western Front, no wonder the battle scenes looked so authentic .Robert Shaw ,with his blue eyes blazing, is the fanatical tank commander, he was chosen because he can play virtually anything that's given to him.It was rather an obvious choice , there are so few good actors and he's capable of doing anything. Henry Fonda is terrific, as obstinate officer who finds vital German attacking position. In the remaining supporting cast appear Telly Savallas as a roguish sergeant, James McArthur as an unexperienced young lieutenant, George Montgomery as a valiant veteran sergeant, among others.\n\nThe Battle of Bulge film is based on true events about the Ardennes offensive, the real deeds are the following : It was a Hitler's plan code-named ¨Watch on the Rhine¨for a breakthrough by Field Marshal Von Rundstedt aimed at the US line in the Ardennes 16 Dec 1944 . Hitler aimed to isolate the Allied forces north of the corridor which would be created by a drive through the Ardennes, creating a German salient or bulge. There were 77.000 Allied casualties and 130.000 German, including Hitler's last powerful reserve of elite Panzer units. Although US troops were encircled for some weeks at Bastogne, the German counteroffensive failed. Three armies were deployed in the operation- Dietrich's 6th Panzer,the 5th Panzer, and the 7th Panzer-together with a 'Trojan Horse' force of English-speaking in US uniforms under Otto Skorzeny. The offensive opened 16 Dec along 113 Km of the front , aiming at the US 1st Army and General Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group. Initial progress was good as the Allies were unprepared for action along a section of the front hitherto so quiet it had been nicknamed ¨the Ghost Front¨and bad weather grounded Allied air support. However, the Germans failed to capture vital fuel dumps and the dogged Allied defense of St Vith and Bastogne seriously set the operation back. Bastogne was an important road junction, lay in the path of the German advance and was held by the US 101 Airbone Division. It was besieged by German forces 18 Dec and strongly attacked , the defenses were breached in two places . However the attacks were repulsed and was relieved by the US 4th Armored Division, though fierce fighting continued in the area for some days. The Allies quickly recovered from the initial shock and, while north of the Bulge General Bernard Montgomery blocked the German advance at the Meuse, to the south Bradley's forces also struck back, with General Patton breaking through to relieve Bastogne 26 Dec. By the end of Dec the weather improved, allowing the Allied air forces to play a part in the battle and by 3 Jan 1945 the Allies took the offensive , by 16 Jan the Bulge has been eliminated.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15539,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Furthermore, while both films have been harshly reviled by critics when first released, in time, they have had their reputations make a complete about face and nowadays are numbered among their respective directors' unassailable masterpieces!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33172,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1960-05-16","keywords":"serial killer,filmmaking,voyeurism,pornography,peeping tom","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Peeping Tom","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3348824345","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRhNTE1NTMtMWFkMi00NzVmLWExZjAtMzMyNjI4NTYyNTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRhNTE1NTMtMWFkMi00NzVmLWExZjAtMzMyNjI4NTYyNTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Peeping Tom","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003337/","name":"Karlheinz Böhm","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0557281/","name":"Anna Massey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0790452/","name":"Moira Shearer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003836/","name":"Michael Powell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040391/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0548896/","name":"Leo Marks"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Well, it's no longer a bore to me, at 36, and it's far from empty, but it's still not the masterpiece to me that it seems to be to most film fans.\n\nThe coolest thing about 8 1/2 is the way that it's clearly a film about the film itself... a film about a filmmaker who is making a film, whose analysis of the film he's working on is actually an analysis of the film you are watching - as you're watching it. Conceptually, it's brilliant - and it does do a very good job of making these layered themes work. However, it's simply not that exciting to watch overall - at nearly 2 1/2 hours, it is a bit of a challenge to enjoy all the way through.

There's only one who's iconic but that's because her character represents "the devil" and she's only in a couple of quick scenes. Then, there's the stunning Claudia Cardinale who gets top billing but is actually only in about 1.5 scenes - and her primary scene is a very important one, one of the most important thematically, but, we don't really get much of HER from it. The rest just kind of redundantly trail off in nags throughout the movie - intentionally, but, it doesn't leave you with much. And Marcello Mastroianni's lead character Guido is a bit of a bore but he needs to be because that's kind of the point of the character. Again, it occurs with great purpose but it's simply not very entertaining to watch.\n\nIt's a complex film with a lot to offer, but not enough of what I enjoy about movies.

The architect was Claude-Nicolas Ledoux (1736-1806), whose career began under Louis the Fifteenth 's reign.This is the place where Pierre Kast,a former critic of the famous (or notorious ,depending on whom you ask) "cahiers du cinema" , locates his psychological drama dealing with the loves and times of privileged people ;his settings have always been his forte : the Royal Saltworks here , " Portugal in "vacances portugaises" , Brazil in " un animal doué de déraison" ,and mainly Easter Island in his most accessible film "les soleils de l'île de Pâques "....\n\nIf you expect pure Nouvelle Vague stuff ,this is exactly what you get : bourgeois people ,who have no problems to make both ends meet : they are in their desirable houses like in an ivory tower ,only concerned by their -insignificant - problems , les Salines -de -Chaux being like a fortress which cuts them from the world.\n\nSylvain ,a novelist who wrote a best-seller and since has been experimenting the writer's cramp ,lives with Geneviève , who , when she first appears ,holding a basket of vegetables ,asks herself what she is going to do today ;their neighbors are wealthy politicians :Jacques , nearing forty ,was once a prime minister (no less!) ,but sees time passing him by and longs for another life : ethnography , for instance , would allow him to go and study Easter Island (which the director would later use in his 1972 film);his numerous conquests (including Anne -Marie ,who seems to spend all her time horse-riding in the magnificent forest; a wasted Alexandra Stewart)do not satisfy him anymore .His wife Françoise is still ambitious and hard on the others (a typical NV female character who never had to earn her crust).\n\nThe well-read dialog is so sophisticated that the excellent actors (Daniel Gélin ,Pierre Vaneck ) have rather self-conscious manners ; the screenplay ,appallingly trite, (even the "ménage à trois" was not that original ;the very same year, Luis Bunuel ended his "Viridiana" that way), makes the viewer yawn his head off . It is the first time I have not liked Georges Delerue's score:his fanfare-like music is pompous and intrusive.\n\nIf you can relate to this kind of stuff ,there's more to enjoy in his "vacances portugaises " (1962) ;the subject is the same: wealthy people in a desirable mansion contemplating their navel ;and you will be treated to the delights of twelve people's sentimental problems.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1961-06-12","keywords":"suave,witty,author,writer,countryside","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0036734/","name":"Françoise Arnoul"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004625/","name":"Daniel Gélin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0889005/","name":"Pierre Vaneck"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440924/","name":"Pierre Kast"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064459/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440924/","name":"Pierre Kast"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The architect was Claude-Nicolas Ledoux (1736-1806), whose career began under Louis the Fifteenth 's reign.This is the place where Pierre Kast,a former critic of the famous (or notorious ,depending on whom you ask) "cahiers du cinema" , locates his psychological drama dealing with the loves and times of privileged people ;his settings have always been his forte : the Royal Saltworks here , " Portugal in "vacances portugaises" , Brazil in " un animal doué de déraison" ,and mainly Easter Island in his most accessible film "les soleils de l'île de Pâques "....\n\nIf you expect pure Nouvelle Vague stuff ,this is exactly what you get : bourgeois people ,who have no problems to make both ends meet : they are in their desirable houses like in an ivory tower ,only concerned by their -insignificant - problems , les Salines -de -Chaux being like a fortress which cuts them from the world.\n\nSylvain ,a novelist who wrote a best-seller and since has been experimenting the writer's cramp ,lives with Geneviève , who , when she first appears ,holding a basket of vegetables ,asks herself what she is going to do today ;their neighbors are wealthy politicians :Jacques , nearing forty ,was once a prime minister (no less!) ,but sees time passing him by and longs for another life : ethnography , for instance , would allow him to go and study Easter Island (which the director would later use in his 1972 film);his numerous conquests (including Anne -Marie ,who seems to spend all her time horse-riding in the magnificent forest; a wasted Alexandra Stewart)do not satisfy him anymore .His wife Françoise is still ambitious and hard on the others (a typical NV female character who never had to earn her crust).\n\nThe well-read dialog is so sophisticated that the excellent actors (Daniel Gélin ,Pierre Vaneck ) have rather self-conscious manners ; the screenplay ,appallingly trite, (even the "ménage à trois" was not that original ;the very same year, Luis Bunuel ended his "Viridiana" that way), makes the viewer yawn his head off . It is the first time I have not liked Georges Delerue's score:his fanfare-like music is pompous and intrusive.\n\nIf you can relate to this kind of stuff ,there's more to enjoy in his "vacances portugaises " (1962) ;the subject is the same: wealthy people in a desirable mansion contemplating their navel ;and you will be treated to the delights of twelve people's sentimental problems.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1961-06-12","keywords":"suave,witty,author,writer,countryside","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0036734/","name":"Françoise Arnoul","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004625/","name":"Daniel Gélin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0889005/","name":"Pierre Vaneck"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440924/","name":"Pierre Kast"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064459/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440924/","name":"Pierre Kast"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Did like the structure, with a series of segments revolving around each season of the year (hence the title) and 'The Czech Year' does a very nice job with it.

The characters are detailed and full of life and the sceneries are colourful and atmospheric, old-fashioned yes but in an endearing way. The music is full of energy and beauty of tone, with a real feel for the period and a nostalgic Czech folklore vibe at times. The sung words don't ramble or get cheesy or schmaltzy. The characters are as alive in personality as they are in look and are engaging.\n\nWhile the story is basically a series of segments revolving around the seasons, this is handled cleverly and not in too episodic a way. Actually found myself learning a good deal about the beautiful to watch and interesting seasonal traditions and emotionally it's done beautifully. Very slight and uneventful on occasions, but very charming and fascinates a good deal.

    <title lang="fr">Le silence de la mer</title>
    <desc lang="fr">Le silence de la mer: Directed by Jean-Pierre Melville. With Howard Vernon, Nicole Stéphane, Jean-Marie Robain, Ami Aaröe. 1941 in a small town in Nazi occupied France. Against the will of its elderly male and his adult niece residents, the Nazis commandeer a house for one of their officers, Lt. Werner von Ebrennac, to live in for as long as he is in the area on Nazi business. As a figurative and literal silent protest against the Nazis and the officer, the uncle and niece do whatever is required of them while the officer is in their house, however they do not acknowledge his presence, living largely in silence whenever he is around. The officer treats the housing situation with care, like he is a guest. Although not a nightly occurrence, the officer begins an evening routine with his reluctant hosts: in his civilian clothes, he knocks on the door of the room in which they have convened for the evening, walking in shortly thereafter knowing that no acknowledgment will be made for him to enter, he visits with them for no more than five minutes before he bids them a good evening as he exits. During these visits, he speaks reverently about, among other things, culture - music and literature in particular as he is a composer and musician - his national pride, his love of France, and what he hopes will emerge from the war, namely a strong and free France, stronger than it was before the war, and the marriage between the French and German cultures which will enrich the lives of all Europeans. All the while, he makes no expectations from them, either to listen, or to answer if they are indeed listening. At the end of what ends up being his six month stay at the house, he does end up having a profound effect on the uncle and niece, despite that effect being largely unacknowledged, as his stay in France has a profound effect on him, opening up his eyes to the reality of the war based largely on his first ever visit into Paris." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0039822/","name":"Le silence de la mer","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJjM2ZkZTEtZDM0My00YzU2LWEzNTMtMWExNDY3OWNmYjlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"1941 in a small town in Nazi occupied France.

I think it is one of the best movies made in Europe in the first years after the WW2. It is quiet and simple, but very powerful at the same time. Without any killing or death in it, this film shows the absurdness and tragedy of war better than any other I have seen. At the same time, for me this was a very good insight in the spirit of French resistance. But above all, it is about a collapse of dreams, a conflict between one's conscience and ideology, and a realisation of how senseless human feelings, aspirations and the whole existence is made by the war. Very deep and impressive.

 --- Description: Le silence de la mer: Directed by Jean-Pierre Melville. With Howard Vernon, Nicole Stéphane, Jean-Marie Robain, Ami Aaröe. 1941 in a small town in Nazi occupied France. Against the will of its elderly male and his adult niece residents, the Nazis commandeer a house for one of their officers, Lt. Werner von Ebrennac, to live in for as long as he is in the area on Nazi business. As a figurative and literal silent protest against the Nazis and the officer, the uncle and niece do whatever is required of them while the officer is in their house, however they do not acknowledge his presence, living largely in silence whenever he is around. The officer treats the housing situation with care, like he is a guest. Although not a nightly occurrence, the officer begins an evening routine with his reluctant hosts: in his civilian clothes, he knocks on the door of the room in which they have convened for the evening, walking in shortly thereafter knowing that no acknowledgment will be made for him to enter, he visits with them for no more than five minutes before he bids them a good evening as he exits. During these visits, he speaks reverently about, among other things, culture - music and literature in particular as he is a composer and musician - his national pride, his love of France, and what he hopes will emerge from the war, namely a strong and free France, stronger than it was before the war, and the marriage between the French and German cultures which will enrich the lives of all Europeans. All the while, he makes no expectations from them, either to listen, or to answer if they are indeed listening. At the end of what ends up being his six month stay at the house, he does end up having a profound effect on the uncle and niece, despite that effect being largely unacknowledged, as his stay in France has a profound effect on him, opening up his eyes to the reality of the war based largely on his first ever visit into Paris." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0039822/","name":"Le silence de la mer","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJjM2ZkZTEtZDM0My00YzU2LWEzNTMtMWExNDY3OWNmYjlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"1941 in a small town in Nazi occupied France.

I think it is one of the best movies made in Europe in the first years after the WW2. It is quiet and simple, but very powerful at the same time. Without any killing or death in it, this film shows the absurdness and tragedy of war better than any other I have seen. At the same time, for me this was a very good insight in the spirit of French resistance. But above all, it is about a collapse of dreams, a conflict between one's conscience and ideology, and a realisation of how senseless human feelings, aspirations and the whole existence is made by the war. Very deep and impressive. I felt like crying at the end.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4612,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"1949-04-22","keywords":"reference to rene descartes,notre dame cathedral,organ,occupied france,german in france","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0894677/","name":"Howard Vernon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0836677/","name":"Nicole Stéphane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0730153/","name":"Jean-Marie Robain"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578483/","name":"Jean-Pierre Melville"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020223/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893736/","name":"Vercors","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578483/","name":"Jean-Pierre Melville"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Well, perhaps I shouldn't judge that right now.

But, as much as I loved those two films, they didn't envelope me like Mamma Roma did.\n\nAnna Magnani plays the titular character, an aging, plump, and earthy whore. Her pimp has retired and let her go, so Mamma Ro' runs off to the country to gather up her teenage son. The backstory of the son is left obscure. Apparently Mamma Ro' left him with some relatives or something like that. Her son, Ettore, is excited to move to Rome, but he is not sure whether he trusts his mother. She has abandoned him for most of his life presumably (one of the great gifts that Pasolini has in this film is that he never spells anything out, but just suggests  and implies a lot).\n\nThe film shifts between Mamma Ro' and Ettore. Ro' is running a respectable fruit stand, although she likes to hang around all of her friends who are still prostitutes and pimps. Probably the most memorable shot of the film occurs when Ro' walks down the streets of rural Rome at night. The camera moves backwards on a dolly, and Ro' is constantly walking towards it. Her friends approach her, talk with her and walk with her a while, only to drop back. A few seconds later, a new companion will walk up next to Ro' and walk beside her, talk with her. There are actually two scenes with this shockingly beautiful technique, used at strategic points of the film. Mamma Roma cares about her son more than anything. She is a good mother, or at least she is overly determined to be one.\n\nEttore, on the other hand, lives a life of boredom. School does not interest him, nor does work. He would rather hang around with all the local hoodlums and the local tramp who lives down the street. He wanders around amongst the ruins of ancient Roman city walls. The landscape is simply beautiful, but in a very desolate manner. As the film progresses, Ettore grows more and more delinquent.\n\nThe themes of mother and son are universal. Of making amends and of growing up. This film captures the feel of human existence as almost no other film does. Pasolini is a genius, he has his fingers right on the pulse of human rhythm. I think that he captures what the neorealist directors were always after. They always got bogged down in melodrama, although I do love a ton of them. Mamma Roma is the kind of film that makes me happy to be alive. It's not exactly a happy film, but it is wonderfully life affirming.

Basically it's a typical well-made french film about relations, with great acting, set in Paris. But it's more than that: it's also a musical. Here are some reasons why I think it's a great movie. First, the chansons, play-backed by the actors, are brilliant. Imagine a Wehrmachtofficer lipsinging to an Edith-Piaf chanson (in the opening act).

Basically it's a typical well-made french film about relations, with great acting, set in Paris. But it's more than that: it's also a musical. Here are some reasons why I think it's a great movie. First, the chansons, play-backed by the actors, are brilliant. Imagine a Wehrmachtofficer lipsinging to an Edith-Piaf chanson (in the opening act). The best thing about the chansons, is the fact that they actually support the story, as they serve as moments of reflection and introspection for the players. Maybe it's the contrast between the extreme sentimentality and the 'serious' acting that makes this film so great.

The world the new baby 's born to is not a rosy one :her grandfather ,Daniel , is a convict ,about to be released from jail and her grandma,Sylvie ,started a new life with Richard ,a bus driver . A family has got to stand together if they want to survive in the fin de decade ruthless world of Marseille : women are still selling their body to eat ( Sylvie after her first husband was arrested became a prostitute before meeting Richard ), the new father is beaten up in an extremely violent scene ,a poor woman does shoplifting, and the son-in-law , Bruno ,opening triumphantly his new shop , even if he leaves a member of his family in the cold . The ex-convict ,now a granddad , did not want to live a routine life and he tells him so to the bus driver ;"but now,he says,I envy you" .He ,who has hardy 600 euros a month to live , will be,all in all ,the happiest character in the days following his release :he writes poetry in his notebook , he takes care of his granddaughter (note how his daughter reluctantly welcomes him :when he takes the baby in his arms ,she shows contempt ,even hatred. He who has been imprisoned for years gets his pleasure from simple things : breathing the open sea air ; when he goes to a room with a prostitute,he leaves her before having sex: he has understood that they are like his sisters ,victims of the society of the leave-them-behind. Sylvie ,his ex-wife ,comes against the union man ,and refuses to go on strike : she claims that she finds it hard to make both ends meet and that anyway trade unionists leaders are privileged people -which is sometimes true- ;Sylvie is not selfish ,far from it, but she has to help her family ,and in the past ,she got a raw deal .(One must remember that the director is a leftist). But some sunlight does break through on this one , like on the other Guédiguian works: Mathilda let the shoplifter go , the doctor won't register a complaint against the unfortunate new father ; the writer/director pits their generosity against the Aurore/Bruno couple's cynicism ,pushiness and pettiness. History never repeats itself ,they say ,but in this family's story, it could .Daniel , the ex-convict is the real hero ,in the noblest term of the term , of the story ;some kind of 2019 Jean Valjean - Guédiguian had already showed Victor's Hugo 's influence : "kilimandjaro was inspired by the writer's poem "les pauvres gens" -,he will sacrifice himself ,so his family can go on . Like John Cassavetes, Guediguian has his own team of actors: his partner, Ariane Ascaride ,the most compassionate face in the contemporary French cinema ,the always reliable Darroussin who never thinks twice when it comes to playing thankless parts. But this movie belongs to Gérard Meylan , in his restrained but deeply moving performance as a weary man who has nothing but a small baby . Yes ,we do need Guédiguian ,the poet of the underdogs! A propos Mr Lippman 's previous insightful review: "your" sequence is easy to spot in the movie ; the young daddy (R. Stevenin) drives a group of American tourists through the streets of Marseille city.

History never repeats itself ,they say ,but in this family's story, it could .Daniel , the ex-convict is the real hero ,in the noblest term of the term , of the story ;some kind of 2019 Jean Valjean - Guédiguian had already showed Victor's Hugo 's influence : "kilimandjaro was inspired by the writer's poem "les pauvres gens" -,he will sacrifice himself ,so his family can go on . Like John Cassavetes, Guediguian has his own team of actors: his partner, Ariane Ascaride ,the most compassionate face in the contemporary French cinema ,the always reliable Darroussin who never thinks twice when it comes to playing thankless parts. But this movie belongs to Gérard Meylan , in his restrained but deeply moving performance as a weary man who has nothing but a small baby . Yes ,we do need Guédiguian ,the poet of the underdogs! A propos Mr Lippman 's previous insightful review: "your" sequence is easy to spot in the movie ; the young daddy (R. Stevenin) drives a group of American tourists through the streets of Marseille city. Thanks for championing this film!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":716,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-27","keywords":"latin title,2010s,marseille france,childbirth,cleaning lady","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1653587737","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjNjkyODItYmQxYy00OWYxLTk1YmQtMWVmNmVhZTVlZTIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGVjNjkyODItYmQxYy00OWYxLTk1YmQtMWVmNmVhZTVlZTIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0038449/","name":"Ariane Ascaride","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201669/","name":"Jean-Pierre Darroussin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0583681/","name":"Gérard Meylan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350168/","name":"Robert Guédiguian"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0331004/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044140/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0089379/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350168/","name":"Robert Guédiguian","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0885087/","name":"Serge Valletti"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He's also a contractor and furniture business entrepreneur. He's actually a pretty stand-up young man. Adam (Alex Pettyfer) isn't as put together, but his sister wants him to be. So when she ventures out to Xquisite, the all male dance revue, she exclaims "I was hoping it was all a joke." I don't blame her, I thought it was too. Mike responds, "No, but it is pretty funny." He's also right.\n\n"Magic Mike" is indeed about a male strip club. The other strippers and their routines were all very funny. They definitely went too far at times, but I think that was part of the joke. Matthew McConaughey, as the club owner, seemed to be playing a character playing himself. A sort of tongue-in-cheek joke making fun of the types of roles he gets. He was fearless, willing to say or do anything to get the joke. There is something special about an actor like that.\n\nShortly before the release, positive critics reviews started coming out plus the realization that this was directed by Steven Soderbergh. It makes one think that perhaps there is more to this movie than just guys stripping. Well, yes and no. The majority of this movie is about the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers with plenty of scenes for the predominantly female audience to ogle at their dance moves. As expected, that gets annoying quickly.\n\nAlso as expected, the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers involves easy women and drugs, all of which can be bought with a lot of money. Mike tries to stay out of that style of living. He knows what he wants in life and the "proper" way to get it. On the other hand, Adam very much wants the hard-living style; that's exactly where he wants to be in life. This leads to a brilliant sequence, near the end of the film, where Mike is old enough to be passed his quarter-life crisis while Adam is just approaching his. But one is at more of a cross-roads than the other.\n\nI am also assuming that Soderbergh has chosen to direct this just to do something different. Choosing interesting light effects and strange camera angles, just for fun I suppose. This is a genre that is not known for being inventive and I don't think much of his effort was necessary. But the characters and particularly their dichotomies that he added makes the film worth it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134342,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-06-29","keywords":"male stripper,male objectification,male nudity,abs,stripper","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi889627417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDdiNzgzZTMtOTI2YS00NTA5LWJkMTYtZDQ3ZDFmM2EzZGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDdiNzgzZTMtOTI2YS00NTA5LWJkMTYtZDQ3ZDFmM2EzZGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"Mike, an experienced stripper, takes a younger performer called The Kid under his wing and schools him in the arts of partying, picking up women, and making easy money."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1641117/","name":"Alex Pettyfer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1601397/","name":"Olivia Munn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0380595/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0265102/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332172/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1730221/","name":"Reid Carolin"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He's also a contractor and furniture business entrepreneur. He's actually a pretty stand-up young man. Adam (Alex Pettyfer) isn't as put together, but his sister wants him to be. So when she ventures out to Xquisite, the all male dance revue, she exclaims "I was hoping it was all a joke." I don't blame her, I thought it was too. Mike responds, "No, but it is pretty funny." He's also right.\n\n"Magic Mike" is indeed about a male strip club. The other strippers and their routines were all very funny. They definitely went too far at times, but I think that was part of the joke. Matthew McConaughey, as the club owner, seemed to be playing a character playing himself. A sort of tongue-in-cheek joke making fun of the types of roles he gets. He was fearless, willing to say or do anything to get the joke. There is something special about an actor like that.\n\nShortly before the release, positive critics reviews started coming out plus the realization that this was directed by Steven Soderbergh. It makes one think that perhaps there is more to this movie than just guys stripping. Well, yes and no. The majority of this movie is about the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers with plenty of scenes for the predominantly female audience to ogle at their dance moves. As expected, that gets annoying quickly.\n\nAlso as expected, the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers involves easy women and drugs, all of which can be bought with a lot of money. Mike tries to stay out of that style of living. He knows what he wants in life and the "proper" way to get it. On the other hand, Adam very much wants the hard-living style; that's exactly where he wants to be in life. This leads to a brilliant sequence, near the end of the film, where Mike is old enough to be passed his quarter-life crisis while Adam is just approaching his. But one is at more of a cross-roads than the other.\n\nI am also assuming that Soderbergh has chosen to direct this just to do something different. Choosing interesting light effects and strange camera angles, just for fun I suppose. This is a genre that is not known for being inventive and I don't think much of his effort was necessary. But the characters and particularly their dichotomies that he added makes the film worth it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134342,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-06-29","keywords":"male stripper,male objectification,male nudity,abs,stripper","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi889627417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDdiNzgzZTMtOTI2YS00NTA5LWJkMTYtZDQ3ZDFmM2EzZGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDdiNzgzZTMtOTI2YS00NTA5LWJkMTYtZDQ3ZDFmM2EzZGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"Mike, an experienced stripper, takes a younger performer called The Kid under his wing and schools him in the arts of partying, picking up women, and making easy money.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1641117/","name":"Alex Pettyfer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1601397/","name":"Olivia Munn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0380595/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0265102/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332172/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1730221/","name":"Reid Carolin"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sometimes you just do things because you want to try something new, and eventually it becomes your passion. This is a slow movie, but it does have some good acting and a few emotional scenes.\n\nIt is about a girl who finishes school but her perception of reality is false. She cannot find a job, her boyfriend leaves her, and she find slight happiness in the process of making and serving tea.\n\nThere are mostly actresses in this movie (I think there are only 2 - 3 actors). At least 80% of the movie takes place in the tea room, but because of the story it works.

Sometimes you just do things because you want to try something new, and eventually it becomes your passion.

She cannot find a job, her boyfriend leaves her, and she find slight happiness in the process of making and serving tea.\n\nThere are mostly actresses in this movie (I think there are only 2 - 3 actors).

The killer killed 12 of them..\n\nThis is not a serial killer who comes out of the blue.Tavernier takes time to describe his mind :he was bitten by a rabid dog (or more like as one scene in a church tells us ,he was raped by a priest),he served in the army but was discharged,and mainly the girl he loved did not want him anymore.He tried to kill her and to take his own life but he failed twice,and in the asylum,they wrecked his brain.Although he is a killer,he is actually a political prisoner:he realized that as far his crimes were concerned ,the blame had to be put on a criminal society:in a remarkable scene ,the judge's mother reads the reports concerning the awful crimes as if she 's reading the tittle-tattle of the town.The serial killer identifies himself with Jesus and Joan of Arc ...\n\nIn direct contrast to hîm,we have the judge :admirably portrayed by Tavernier's favourite actor ,Philippe Noiret,he epitomizes the bourgeoisie,the man who wants to keep the world as it is;this is a very complex opaque character:nearing 50,he stills lives with his mother,and he's got nasty habits (see the scene when he buggers Isabelle Huppert).\n\nThere are a lot of things to say about "le juge et l'assassin":the film successfully recreates the atmosphere of the period,not only by its hints at Dreyfus,at a country which is bent on revenge ,at a Church which feels its power slip away (the priest thundering against "school without God" ,about 10 years after Jules Ferry instituted secular education,and about 10 years before the separation of the Church and the State in France).But it even recreates it with its original songs ,which is quite a feat.We really feel we are in the time machine,and that's the main reason why Tavernier's movie is so precious:no one can find echoes of the seventies in France,which would have dated and marred the film.Even if the socialists appear at the end of the movie,there's no connection with their impending coming in the eighties.\n\nA masterpiece ,Tavernier's best film along with "la vie et rien d'autre".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1952,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"genre":["Crime","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1976-03-10","keywords":"reference to the virgin mary,confession of crime,murder confession,reference to robespierre,reference to emile zola","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1353302041","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkZTUzMWItY2NmZi00YWFhLTllZTMtZmQzNmFjNmFkY2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkZTUzMWItY2NmZi00YWFhLTllZTMtZmQzNmFjNmFkY2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634159/","name":"Philippe Noiret"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0301556/","name":"Michel Galabru"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851724/","name":"Bertrand Tavernier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012275/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029701/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079070/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0042179/","name":"Jean Aurenche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851724/","name":"Bertrand Tavernier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0098204/","name":"Pierre Bost"}],"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The killer killed 12 of them..\n\nThis is not a serial killer who comes out of the blue.Tavernier takes time to describe his mind :he was bitten by a rabid dog (or more like as one scene in a church tells us ,he was raped by a priest),he served in the army but was discharged,and mainly the girl he loved did not want him anymore.He tried to kill her and to take his own life but he failed twice,and in the asylum,they wrecked his brain.Although he is a killer,he is actually a political prisoner:he realized that as far his crimes were concerned ,the blame had to be put on a criminal society:in a remarkable scene ,the judge's mother reads the reports concerning the awful crimes as if she 's reading the tittle-tattle of the town.The serial killer identifies himself with Jesus and Joan of Arc ...\n\nIn direct contrast to hîm,we have the judge :admirably portrayed by Tavernier's favourite actor ,Philippe Noiret,he epitomizes the bourgeoisie,the man who wants to keep the world as it is;this is a very complex opaque character:nearing 50,he stills lives with his mother,and he's got nasty habits (see the scene when he buggers Isabelle Huppert).\n\nThere are a lot of things to say about "le juge et l'assassin":the film successfully recreates the atmosphere of the period,not only by its hints at Dreyfus,at a country which is bent on revenge ,at a Church which feels its power slip away (the priest thundering against "school without God" ,about 10 years after Jules Ferry instituted secular education,and about 10 years before the separation of the Church and the State in France).But it even recreates it with its original songs ,which is quite a feat.We really feel we are in the time machine,and that's the main reason why Tavernier's movie is so precious:no one can find echoes of the seventies in France,which would have dated and marred the film.Even if the socialists appear at the end of the movie,there's no connection with their impending coming in the eighties.\n\nA masterpiece ,Tavernier's best film along with "la vie et rien d'autre".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1952,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Crime","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1976-03-10","keywords":"reference to the virgin mary,confession of crime,murder confession,reference to robespierre,reference to emile zola","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1353302041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkZTUzMWItY2NmZi00YWFhLTllZTMtZmQzNmFjNmFkY2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkZTUzMWItY2NmZi00YWFhLTllZTMtZmQzNmFjNmFkY2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634159/","name":"Philippe Noiret","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0301556/","name":"Michel Galabru","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851724/","name":"Bertrand Tavernier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012275/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029701/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079070/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0042179/","name":"Jean Aurenche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851724/","name":"Bertrand Tavernier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0098204/","name":"Pierre Bost"],"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Of course, there have always been film-makers who have dared to brave this peril, and it is as well that there have been, otherwise we would have been deprived of, for example, Kenneth Branagh's interpretation of "Henry V", which spoke to the eighties just as Laurence Olivier's had spoken to the forties.\n\nGraham Greene's novel "Brighton Rock" was famously adapted for the screen by the Boulting brothers in 1947, and their version is widely regarded as one of the greatest films from the "Golden Age" of the British cinema during the forties and fifties. Rowan Joffé's recent remake has not been universally well-received, particularly by those who believe that nothing can ever compete with its illustrious predecessor. Much as I admire the Boultings' film, however, I have to admit that the newcomer has many virtues of its own.\n\nThe main character is Pinkie Brown, the youthful leader of a gang of thugs whose principal activity is protection racketeering. Early in the film, Pinkie murders Hale, a member of a rival gang, in revenge for the murder by Hale of Pinkie's colleague Kite. (In the original novel and the 1947 film, Hale was a journalist who had been investigating the gang's activities. Another change is the date at which the story takes place; although the novel and original film are both set in the 1930s, this adaptation is set during the Mods and Rockers era of the 1960s).\n\nPinkie tries to cover his tracks by creating a false alibi for himself, which leads to the commission of further crimes and to Pinkie's marriage to Rose, a young waitress who he believes might be in possession of evidence which could send him to the gallows. Pinkie is not in love with Rose, but marries her because at the time the film is set there was a rule of English law that a wife could not give evidence against her husband. The ending is closer to the one Greene wrote in his novel, although Joffé keeps the famous twist which the writer introduced when he produced the 1947 screenplay.\n\nJoffe said that he made the film because, on reading the novel, he "fell absolutely in love with the character of Rose", and the treatment of this character is, in my view, the one area in which the modern film is better than the earlier one. Andrea Riseborough's interpretation of the character- downbeat, dowdy, bespectacled and needy- seems just right for the role. Rose responds to Pinkie's overtures because he is the only person to have shown her any affection, and she is naïve enough to overlook his obvious criminality and not to realise that his affection for her is feigned. Carol Marsh's Rose, however, was rather too glamorous; it was difficult to imagine her as someone lacking in male admirers.\n\nThere are also good performances from two veterans of the British cinema, John Hurt and Helen Mirren. Hurt plays the bookmaker Phil Corkery, who has a more important role in this adaptation than he does in the book. Mirren plays Ida Arnold, the woman whose determination to get at the truth results in Pinkie's downfall. In the 1947 Ida was played by Hermione Baddeley as a blowsy, ageing showgirl and a casual acquaintance of Hale; here she becomes the manageress of the café where Rose works and a close friend of the murdered man.\n\nI was less impressed by Sam Riley who, as Pinkie, lacked the sense of menace and evil which Richard Attenborough brought to the role. At 30, moreover, Riley seemed too old to play a teenager. (Attenborough would have been 24 in 1947, and looked younger). Also, I couldn't see the point of setting the story in the 1960s, as the "Mods and Rockers" element added little, or nothing, to Greene's story. Pinkie's gang, and the rival Colleoni gang, were both part of Brighton's own criminal underworld, whereas the Mods and Rockers were drawn from all over the country, especially London, and merely chose Brighton, and other seaside resorts, as convenient places for their battles.\n\nJoffé has also discarded a lot of the religious content of the original novel. Greene made Ida an atheist whose system of values was based upon secular ideas of "right" and "wrong", as opposed to Pinkie and Rose, both believing Catholics who believed firmly in "good" and "evil". This opposition between two contrasting attitudes to morality was an important theme of the novel, but it is not something dwelt on at length in either film. The 1947 version downplayed Pinkie's religious beliefs, possibly as a concession to Catholics unhappy with the idea of one of their flock being portrayed as a violent criminal, although it did concentrate on Rose's spiritual development.

Of course, there have always been film-makers who have dared to brave this peril, and it is as well that there have been, otherwise we would have been deprived of, for example, Kenneth Branagh's interpretation of "Henry V", which spoke to the eighties just as Laurence Olivier's had spoken to the forties.\n\nGraham Greene's novel "Brighton Rock" was famously adapted for the screen by the Boulting brothers in 1947, and their version is widely regarded as one of the greatest films from the "Golden Age" of the British cinema during the forties and fifties. Rowan Joffé's recent remake has not been universally well-received, particularly by those who believe that nothing can ever compete with its illustrious predecessor. Much as I admire the Boultings' film, however, I have to admit that the newcomer has many virtues of its own.\n\nThe main character is Pinkie Brown, the youthful leader of a gang of thugs whose principal activity is protection racketeering. Early in the film, Pinkie murders Hale, a member of a rival gang, in revenge for the murder by Hale of Pinkie's colleague Kite. (In the original novel and the 1947 film, Hale was a journalist who had been investigating the gang's activities. Another change is the date at which the story takes place; although the novel and original film are both set in the 1930s, this adaptation is set during the Mods and Rockers era of the 1960s).\n\nPinkie tries to cover his tracks by creating a false alibi for himself, which leads to the commission of further crimes and to Pinkie's marriage to Rose, a young waitress who he believes might be in possession of evidence which could send him to the gallows. Pinkie is not in love with Rose, but marries her because at the time the film is set there was a rule of English law that a wife could not give evidence against her husband. The ending is closer to the one Greene wrote in his novel, although Joffé keeps the famous twist which the writer introduced when he produced the 1947 screenplay.\n\nJoffe said that he made the film because, on reading the novel, he "fell absolutely in love with the character of Rose", and the treatment of this character is, in my view, the one area in which the modern film is better than the earlier one. Andrea Riseborough's interpretation of the character- downbeat, dowdy, bespectacled and needy- seems just right for the role. Rose responds to Pinkie's overtures because he is the only person to have shown her any affection, and she is naïve enough to overlook his obvious criminality and not to realise that his affection for her is feigned. Carol Marsh's Rose, however, was rather too glamorous; it was difficult to imagine her as someone lacking in male admirers.\n\nThere are also good performances from two veterans of the British cinema, John Hurt and Helen Mirren. Hurt plays the bookmaker Phil Corkery, who has a more important role in this adaptation than he does in the book. Mirren plays Ida Arnold, the woman whose determination to get at the truth results in Pinkie's downfall. In the 1947 Ida was played by Hermione Baddeley as a blowsy, ageing showgirl and a casual acquaintance of Hale; here she becomes the manageress of the café where Rose works and a close friend of the murdered man.\n\nI was less impressed by Sam Riley who, as Pinkie, lacked the sense of menace and evil which Richard Attenborough brought to the role. At 30, moreover, Riley seemed too old to play a teenager. (Attenborough would have been 24 in 1947, and looked younger). Also, I couldn't see the point of setting the story in the 1960s, as the "Mods and Rockers" element added little, or nothing, to Greene's story. Pinkie's gang, and the rival Colleoni gang, were both part of Brighton's own criminal underworld, whereas the Mods and Rockers were drawn from all over the country, especially London, and merely chose Brighton, and other seaside resorts, as convenient places for their battles.\n\nJoffé has also discarded a lot of the religious content of the original novel. Greene made Ida an atheist whose system of values was based upon secular ideas of "right" and "wrong", as opposed to Pinkie and Rose, both believing Catholics who believed firmly in "good" and "evil". This opposition between two contrasting attitudes to morality was an important theme of the novel, but it is not something dwelt on at length in either film. The 1947 version downplayed Pinkie's religious beliefs, possibly as a concession to Catholics unhappy with the idea of one of their flock being portrayed as a violent criminal, although it did concentrate on Rose's spiritual development. The modern film acknowledges that both Pinkie and Rose are "Romans", but for the most part avoids theological issues and turns Greene's story into the basis for a grim, grey neo-noir type crime thriller. (The 1947 film was set during a sunny summer Bank Holiday; this version appears to have been shot in winter, with Brighton largely deserted by holidaymakers). It is up to the viewer to decide which approach he or she prefers. 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-02-04","keywords":"prayer,spiv,waitress,gang,brighton","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Brighton Rock: International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4823321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDMxNTAwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI5MzIxNA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDMxNTAwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI5MzIxNA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A waitress with evidence linking a fledging mobster to a murder finds herself seduced by the young criminal.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0727165/","name":"Sam Riley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2057859/","name":"Andrea Riseborough","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000545/","name":"Helen Mirren"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0423626/","name":"Rowan Joffe"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104811/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0423626/","name":"Rowan Joffe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001294/","name":"Graham Greene"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When they do so despite years of being recycled, it's usually thanks to talent. "Saw" director James Wan found something of promise in "Saw" writer Leigh Whannell's story "Insidious" and the same must've gone for stars Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. Horror films rarely get that infusion of talent, and as such, "Insidious" does not get lost in that dark dimension of forgettable horror.\n\nJosh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) Lambert have moved into a new home with their two young boys and infant girl. Like always, paranormal oddities occur in small doses here and there until one morning they find their son Dalton in a coma. A few months pass and they move Dalton back home. The freaky incidences increase and eventually Renai sees the ghosts. She convinces Josh to move them into a new home, but it gets worse, so they bring in a paranormal expert (Lin Shaye) who provides them with some shocking revelations about the state of their son.\n\nLike "Paranormal Activity" (a film thats producers have credits on this film unsurprisingly), the idea is to mount tension through paranormal phenomena and expert suspense. Wan provides a number of perfect angles and color to achieve the various moods. As much as you've been spooked this way by films before, you can't simply shirk the way the film creeps in — Wan won't have any of it. In fact, nothing here in terms of scare tactics will come as a revelation; many with a higher jumpiness tolerance will likely find it boring in many regards. No gore or horrific images to be found here — "Insidious" does it old school.\n\nOnce Shaye's character Elise and her two employees arrive on scene, the story mutates from paranormal suspense to other-worldly mystery. Elise explains what's going on — something that involves Dalton's soul being lost in a realm called The Further — and now they must rescue him. Whannell constructs an interesting mythology here and the story goes from horror to more of a mystery/thriller with demonic elements. In a sense he borrows from science fiction in establishing the rules of what's going on. It's mostly interesting, but in many instances flat-out weird to the point that horror purists might not like it.\n\nThe best way to describe "Insidious" is first half "Paranormal Activity" and second half something akin to Sam Raimi's "Drag Me To Hell," which equates to a nice balance between self-seriousness and horror fun. The "X" factor would be the performances. Byrne keeps Renai from becoming an obnoxious scaredy cat as her role's importance dwindles in the latter half of the film, in which time she still keeps Renai relevant. Wilson's character is no typical over- macho father figure or anything. Together they provide an unusual boost for horror, which typically strives for random faces with questionable experience.\n\nIn general, "Insidious" possesses a professionalism not often seen in the genre; most horror films go for cheap across the board from the budget to the talent to the thrills. Although "Insidious" lacks distinctiveness in terms of story, not an ounce of it can be perceived as immature or hollow. What a rare (but not unusual) treat.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":287142,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When they do so despite years of being recycled, it's usually thanks to talent. "Saw" director James Wan found something of promise in "Saw" writer Leigh Whannell's story "Insidious" and the same must've gone for stars Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. Horror films rarely get that infusion of talent, and as such, "Insidious" does not get lost in that dark dimension of forgettable horror.\n\nJosh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) Lambert have moved into a new home with their two young boys and infant girl. Like always, paranormal oddities occur in small doses here and there until one morning they find their son Dalton in a coma. A few months pass and they move Dalton back home. The freaky incidences increase and eventually Renai sees the ghosts. She convinces Josh to move them into a new home, but it gets worse, so they bring in a paranormal expert (Lin Shaye) who provides them with some shocking revelations about the state of their son.\n\nLike "Paranormal Activity" (a film thats producers have credits on this film unsurprisingly), the idea is to mount tension through paranormal phenomena and expert suspense. Wan provides a number of perfect angles and color to achieve the various moods. As much as you've been spooked this way by films before, you can't simply shirk the way the film creeps in — Wan won't have any of it. In fact, nothing here in terms of scare tactics will come as a revelation; many with a higher jumpiness tolerance will likely find it boring in many regards. No gore or horrific images to be found here — "Insidious" does it old school.\n\nOnce Shaye's character Elise and her two employees arrive on scene, the story mutates from paranormal suspense to other-worldly mystery. Elise explains what's going on — something that involves Dalton's soul being lost in a realm called The Further — and now they must rescue him. Whannell constructs an interesting mythology here and the story goes from horror to more of a mystery/thriller with demonic elements. In a sense he borrows from science fiction in establishing the rules of what's going on. It's mostly interesting, but in many instances flat-out weird to the point that horror purists might not like it.\n\nThe best way to describe "Insidious" is first half "Paranormal Activity" and second half something akin to Sam Raimi's "Drag Me To Hell," which equates to a nice balance between self-seriousness and horror fun. The "X" factor would be the performances. Byrne keeps Renai from becoming an obnoxious scaredy cat as her role's importance dwindles in the latter half of the film, in which time she still keeps Renai relevant. Wilson's character is no typical over- macho father figure or anything. Together they provide an unusual boost for horror, which typically strives for random faces with questionable experience.\n\nIn general, "Insidious" possesses a professionalism not often seen in the genre; most horror films go for cheap across the board from the budget to the talent to the thrills. Although "Insidious" lacks distinctiveness in terms of story, not an ounce of it can be perceived as immature or hollow. What a rare (but not unusual) treat.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":287142,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I cannot however hide the facts. I liked a lot of things in Jane Campion's last film. Almost each scene is a visual masterpiece in setting, in colors, in placement of the actors, in the angles of the camera. It's a beauty to watch. But one does not come to the movies as he comes to a museum, and even for a visit in a museum two hours of continuous beauty without a break are tiring. The actors are well chosen, they are fresh faces and yet beautiful (Abbie Cornish) and expressive (Ben Whishaw' John Keats), and the film also brings the most adorable red-haired kid actor I have ever seen (the name is Edie Martin). Characters develop, and people speak, and fall in love, and love falls apart, and life falls apart, and there is a lot of poetry in all this, loudly read poetry, but then one does not come to the movies as he comes to a poetry reading. Some action is needed, some suspense is deserved - and this is exactly what 'Bright Star' is lacking in my opinion. We know everything that can and will happen in the film from the start, and the only unknown the film can offer is how fast or how slow the 119 minutes will go.

I cannot however hide the facts. I liked a lot of things in Jane Campion's last film. Almost each scene is a visual masterpiece in setting, in colors, in placement of the actors, in the angles of the camera. It's a beauty to watch. But one does not come to the movies as he comes to a museum, and even for a visit in a museum two hours of continuous beauty without a break are tiring. The actors are well chosen, they are fresh faces and yet beautiful (Abbie Cornish) and expressive (Ben Whishaw' John Keats), and the film also brings the most adorable red-haired kid actor I have ever seen (the name is Edie Martin). Characters develop, and people speak, and fall in love, and love falls apart, and life falls apart, and there is a lot of poetry in all this, loudly read poetry, but then one does not come to the movies as he comes to a poetry reading. Some action is needed, some suspense is deserved - and this is exactly what 'Bright Star' is lacking in my opinion. We know everything that can and will happen in the film from the start, and the only unknown the film can offer is how fast or how slow the 119 minutes will go. Well, they were quite long for me by the end of the film.\n\nJane Campion is back to the period movies genre which made her most famous with 'The Piano'.

I cannot however hide the facts. I liked a lot of things in Jane Campion's last film. Almost each scene is a visual masterpiece in setting, in colors, in placement of the actors, in the angles of the camera. It's a beauty to watch. But one does not come to the movies as he comes to a museum, and even for a visit in a museum two hours of continuous beauty without a break are tiring. The actors are well chosen, they are fresh faces and yet beautiful (Abbie Cornish) and expressive (Ben Whishaw' John Keats), and the film also brings the most adorable red-haired kid actor I have ever seen (the name is Edie Martin). Characters develop, and people speak, and fall in love, and love falls apart, and life falls apart, and there is a lot of poetry in all this, loudly read poetry, but then one does not come to the movies as he comes to a poetry reading. Some action is needed, some suspense is deserved - and this is exactly what 'Bright Star' is lacking in my opinion. We know everything that can and will happen in the film from the start, and the only unknown the film can offer is how fast or how slow the 119 minutes will go. Well, they were quite long for me by the end of the film.\n\nJane Campion is back to the period movies genre which made her most famous with 'The Piano'. In-between she made a couple of films in other genres ('Holy Smoke', 'In the Cut') which I liked more than the average critic and IMDb viewers opinion. I looked that the situation is reversed with 'Bright Star'.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25754,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-11-06","keywords":"reed,artistic creation,period drama,poet,passion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bright Star","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3821732377","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwOTExMDUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjczOTM3Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwOTExMDUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjczOTM3Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A drama based on the three-year romance between 19th century poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne, which was cut short by Keats' untimely death at age 25."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180411/","name":"Abbie Cornish"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0924210/","name":"Ben Whishaw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0773973/","name":"Paul Schneider"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001005/","name":"Jane Campion"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086691/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001005/","name":"Jane Campion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1652346/","name":"Andrew Motion"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I cannot however hide the facts. I liked a lot of things in Jane Campion's last film. Almost each scene is a visual masterpiece in setting, in colors, in placement of the actors, in the angles of the camera. It's a beauty to watch. But one does not come to the movies as he comes to a museum, and even for a visit in a museum two hours of continuous beauty without a break are tiring. The actors are well chosen, they are fresh faces and yet beautiful (Abbie Cornish) and expressive (Ben Whishaw' John Keats), and the film also brings the most adorable red-haired kid actor I have ever seen (the name is Edie Martin). Characters develop, and people speak, and fall in love, and love falls apart, and life falls apart, and there is a lot of poetry in all this, loudly read poetry, but then one does not come to the movies as he comes to a poetry reading. Some action is needed, some suspense is deserved - and this is exactly what 'Bright Star' is lacking in my opinion. We know everything that can and will happen in the film from the start, and the only unknown the film can offer is how fast or how slow the 119 minutes will go. Well, they were quite long for me by the end of the film.\n\nJane Campion is back to the period movies genre which made her most famous with 'The Piano'. In-between she made a couple of films in other genres ('Holy Smoke', 'In the Cut') which I liked more than the average critic and IMDb viewers opinion. I looked that the situation is reversed with 'Bright Star'.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25754,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-11-06","keywords":"reed,artistic creation,period drama,poet,passion","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bright Star","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3821732377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwOTExMDUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjczOTM3Mg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwOTExMDUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjczOTM3Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A drama based on the three-year romance between 19th century poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne, which was cut short by Keats' untimely death at age 25.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180411/","name":"Abbie Cornish","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0924210/","name":"Ben Whishaw","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0773973/","name":"Paul Schneider"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001005/","name":"Jane Campion"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086691/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001005/","name":"Jane Campion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1652346/","name":"Andrew Motion"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There, Jake befriends the charismatic Tony, whose single mother Leonor, a dressmaker from Chile, runs the shop downstairs. Soon, Jake's parents Brian and Kathy -- one, a struggling actor, the other, a psychotherapist -- ask Leonor to sign a new, steeper lease on her store. For Leonor, the proposed new rent is untenable, and a feud ignites between the adults.\n \nAt first, Jake and Tony don't seem to notice; the two boys, so different on the surface, begin to develop a formative kinship as they discover the pleasures of being young in Brooklyn. Jake aspires to be an artist, while Tony wants to be an actor, and they have dreams of going to the same prestigious arts high school together. But the children can't avoid the problems of their parents forever, and soon enough, the adult conflict intrudes upon the borders of their friendship."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000383/","name":"Jennifer Ehle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1257208/","name":"Paulina García"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0755158/","name":"Ira Sachs"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0548768/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0273107/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062860/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0951592/","name":"Mauricio Zacharias"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0755158/","name":"Ira Sachs"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Both are strong, even friendship as seen in this movie but when legal system enters the picture it actions a full stop which can be painful.\n\nDespite this, with strong families their is endurance which I think Jake in this movie achieved.\n\nIt was interesting to see this in movie format. Acting was well done.\n\nDifficult at times to watch life, friendships change but no less true. Thankfully the movie isn't long otherwise it would be too laborous for viewers.\n\nIn conclusion a movie I think to watch when in a mood for charisma &amp; temporary sadness.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-04","keywords":"best friend,father son relationship,gentrification,eviction,teenage boy with a ponytail","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4158501913","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyOTUzNTIxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1MDM5ODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyOTUzNTIxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1MDM5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When 13-year-old Jake's grandfather dies, his family moves from Manhattan back into his father's old Brooklyn home. There, Jake befriends the charismatic Tony, whose single mother Leonor, a dressmaker from Chile, runs the shop downstairs. Soon, Jake's parents Brian and Kathy -- one, a struggling actor, the other, a psychotherapist -- ask Leonor to sign a new, steeper lease on her store. For Leonor, the proposed new rent is untenable, and a feud ignites between the adults.\n \nAt first, Jake and Tony don't seem to notice; the two boys, so different on the surface, begin to develop a formative kinship as they discover the pleasures of being young in Brooklyn. Jake aspires to be an artist, while Tony wants to be an actor, and they have dreams of going to the same prestigious arts high school together. But the children can't avoid the problems of their parents forever, and soon enough, the adult conflict intrudes upon the borders of their friendship.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000383/","name":"Jennifer Ehle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1257208/","name":"Paulina García"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0755158/","name":"Ira Sachs"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0548768/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0273107/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062860/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0951592/","name":"Mauricio Zacharias","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0755158/","name":"Ira Sachs"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

What happens when a man and a woman share a common passion? They fall in love. And this is what happens to Jean-René, the boss of a small chocolate factory, and Angélique, a gifted chocolate maker he has just hired. What occurs when a highly emotional man meets a highly emotional woman? They fall in love, and this is what occurs to Jean-René and Angélique who share the same handicap.

When I learned of its existence, as a great lover of wolves, I rushed to order the DVD, which conveniently has English subtitles. I was not disappointed. Several wolves star in this film, along with the humans. Apart from the black wolf cub at the beginning, these wolves are not 'cute', and this is far from being a Walt Disney movie. This is gritty stuff. The lead is played by French/Corsican actress Letitia Casta, a beautiful creature who became a famous model as a teenager and is now a well-established film actress. She wants to be a veterinarian, and everyone scoffs at her about this, because it is the 1920s. (We are informed in a post credit that the first woman to become a vet in France obtained her qualifications in 1931.) But most of all, Casta wants to save the wild wolves in the foothills of the French Alps above her home town, which is on the border with Italy. In the 1920s, wild wolves still existed there, so this story is very authentic. But the wicked Jean-Paul Rouve wants to kill all the wolves and ruin the area for commercial development. Meanwhile, 'the madman', a wild young man called Giuseppe who is considered 'fou' by the locals, lives alone in a remote shack high up in the mountains where he keeps a donkey in his bedroom and has befriended a pack of wolves who hang around his door and are his only friends. The leader of the pack is the amazing black wolf whom he calls Carbone, whose eyes blaze from his black face like two searchlights. Casta and Giuseppe meet when he and Carbone jointly save her from freezing to death, and Carbone licks her face to revive her because he remembers her scent, as she is the one who saved him years before as an orphan cub. Having dislocated her leg, Casta has to remain for many days in Giuseppe's shack and gets to know him and realizes that he is a deeply sensitive and sympathetic soul. Indeed, Casta carried this realization beyond the screen, because she is now married to the actor who played Giuseppe, Stefano Accorsi, and has two children by him. The story is complex and cannot easily be summarised. Can Casta and Giuseppe together save the wolves, or will the forces of 'progress' win? There is a fascinating 34-minute 'making of' documentary on the DVD entitled BETWEEN MEN AND WOLVES. It has no English subtitles but is well worth watching regardless, as it reveals the incredible feats of the special effects men which were carried out on location in the snow, and above all it shows the work with the wolves and the tame eagle. Eagles are really terrifying if they attack, or even if they don't, frankly. They can kill any animal within seconds. The film features a scene where the eagle attacks a wolf cub and swoops just as the cub escapes into a hole in the rocks. Not long ago I came face to face with a wounded buzzard on the ground, and his vicious hissing and his savage beak as he faced me down and refused to retreat were pretty scary, but a buzzard is nothing compared to an eagle, being only about half the size. I hope I never 'scale up' and come face to face with a desperate eagle. In the documentary, we are informed that both French and American wolves were used, but there were many complaints about the American wolves being too wild and difficult to work with compared to the French ones, who were easier and had greater politesse, being French of course, and thus better mannered. At the end of the documentary, we are treated to scenes of the entire cast and crew howling like wolves. They freely admitted to getting very carried away by their wolfish friends during the filming and doing wolf howls became something they did regularly. Wolves are some of the most fascinating and gentle animals except when they are upset, and then watch out. There is one suckling scene with a female wolf nursing her cubs in a den. So the wolves are by no means just 'extras', they do have real acting roles in this film. This is a genuine, rather than a mawkish and superficial, film, and the director, cast and crew all deserve great praise for making it such a wonderful experience. It is suitable for families, unless parents are concerned at their children seeing a horse with an erection who attempts to mate with a mare, for as we know, farm life is very distant now from modern audiences, and there are some people who really believe that meat only exists when wrapped in plastic and who think that carrots grow on trees. This film is not only deeply satisfying but is an incredible achievement, considering how very difficult it was to get the wolves to make such excellent film debuts.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-02-13","keywords":"man in a wheelchair,modeling for a sculpture,veterinarian,mountain,following someone","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0144377/","name":"Laetitia Casta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009629/","name":"Stefano Accorsi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499448/","name":"Gilles Legrand"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033266/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190586/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0210997/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0181924/","name":"Jean Cosmos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499448/","name":"Gilles Legrand"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1356887/","name":"Philippe Vuaillat"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But "OSS 117 -Le Caire nid d'espions" and its sequel "OSS 117 Rio ne répond plus" fare much better than "Imogène McCarthery, despite the latter's excellent cast (Lambert Wilson, Michel Aumont, Danièle Lebrun, Lionel Abelanski and the three funny actors who play the Soviet spies, Francis Leplay, Nicolas Vaude and Pierre Laplace) and its satisfying natural and artificial settings. What makes the two former films superior to "Imogène" is that they are not content to tell their (superficial) story, they also play on the stereotypes of the B or Z-films of the period the action is set in. OSS 117 is a self-centered, racist chauvinist and does not realise it, whereas we spectators are aware of it Thus we laugh at the fool while, by extension, these human flaws are denounced. In "Imogène", on the contrary, you are asked to be complicit with the title character, who has similar foibles (she is an unrepentant Scottish nationalist, and base all of her behavior on this stiff principle, generating an endless series of repetitive gags). As a result, if you disapprove of ultra nationalism, you will not really have a ball watching Catherine Frot always criticizing the English and the Welsh or breaking her engagement just because her fiancé is too ... tolerant! "Imogène McCarthery" is the first film directed by Franck Magnier and Alexandre Charlot, who once wrote for the famous satiric TV show "Les Guignols de l'Info". Their texts were incisive and biting. They seem to have lost their edge here.Let's hope this is only temporary.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":333,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"genre":["Comedy","Crime","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-05-05","keywords":"character name as title,two word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi100710937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRhMGRjZTctZjYyZC00ODI0LTgyMjQtOTM4YzJhYzMwMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRhMGRjZTctZjYyZC00ODI0LTgyMjQtOTM4YzJhYzMwMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296594/","name":"Catherine Frot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933727/","name":"Lambert Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0495947/","name":"Danièle Lebrun"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0153265/","name":"Alexandre Charlot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536251/","name":"Franck Magnier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066227/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190552/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0264033/","name":"Charles Exbrayat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0153265/","name":"Alexandre Charlot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536251/","name":"Franck Magnier"}],"duration":"PT1H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But "OSS 117 -Le Caire nid d'espions" and its sequel "OSS 117 Rio ne répond plus" fare much better than "Imogène McCarthery, despite the latter's excellent cast (Lambert Wilson, Michel Aumont, Danièle Lebrun, Lionel Abelanski and the three funny actors who play the Soviet spies, Francis Leplay, Nicolas Vaude and Pierre Laplace) and its satisfying natural and artificial settings. What makes the two former films superior to "Imogène" is that they are not content to tell their (superficial) story, they also play on the stereotypes of the B or Z-films of the period the action is set in. OSS 117 is a self-centered, racist chauvinist and does not realise it, whereas we spectators are aware of it Thus we laugh at the fool while, by extension, these human flaws are denounced. In "Imogène", on the contrary, you are asked to be complicit with the title character, who has similar foibles (she is an unrepentant Scottish nationalist, and base all of her behavior on this stiff principle, generating an endless series of repetitive gags). As a result, if you disapprove of ultra nationalism, you will not really have a ball watching Catherine Frot always criticizing the English and the Welsh or breaking her engagement just because her fiancé is too ... tolerant! "Imogène McCarthery" is the first film directed by Franck Magnier and Alexandre Charlot, who once wrote for the famous satiric TV show "Les Guignols de l'Info". Their texts were incisive and biting. They seem to have lost their edge here.Let's hope this is only temporary.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":333,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Comedy","Crime","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-05-05","keywords":"character name as title,two word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi100710937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRhMGRjZTctZjYyZC00ODI0LTgyMjQtOTM4YzJhYzMwMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRhMGRjZTctZjYyZC00ODI0LTgyMjQtOTM4YzJhYzMwMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296594/","name":"Catherine Frot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933727/","name":"Lambert Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0495947/","name":"Danièle Lebrun"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0153265/","name":"Alexandre Charlot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536251/","name":"Franck Magnier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066227/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190552/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0264033/","name":"Charles Exbrayat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0153265/","name":"Alexandre Charlot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536251/","name":"Franck Magnier"],"duration":"PT1H22M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I am not sure if the success of the film is owed to the book it was adapted from or if the script added anything but the story was really engaging.\n\nThe funny and tragic moments never felt forced or embellished and the actors were extremely committed and convincing.\n\nI am not a viewer who knows too much about the film making process so the most I can comment on really is that whilst the ending was rather predictable I was happy I had watched the film and would highly recommend it to others.\n\nI hope the IMDb rating increases as it easily deserves 8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4919,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2010-09-24","keywords":"runaway slave,country estate,ghost,england,13 year old","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1375020/","name":"Alex Etel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001758/","name":"Timothy Spall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001749/","name":"Maggie Smith"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0271501/","name":"Julian Fellowes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040024/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0018857/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126667/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1569280/","name":"Lucy M.

It is starred by Mortadelo , a bald detective with pebble glasses and a long nose who usually wears a black frock coat , his real name comes from "mortadela", a kind of sausage . He is always fighting with Filemón , his partner, mostly because he tends to mess things up, usually to Filemon's discomfort . The latter , the leader of the two-man team, he is an educated man and an expert in a variety of fields . Then , it happens Jimmy el Cachondo and his henchmen have stolen a top secret document from the TIA headquarters that can ridicule them in front of all other spy agencies. The Superintendent will have no choice than to command the mission of retrieving it to Mortadelo and Filemón . To make matters worse, dangerous criminal Tronchamulas has escaped jail and plans to exact revenge on Filemón for arresting him in the past. Eventually they will be forced to team up to find Jimmy's hideout. Meanwhile, Professor Bacterio tries to help the pair of agents with his latest invention : the "reversicine", a beverage that turns people into the exact opposite of what they are or think . There also appears other personages such as ¨Ofelia¨ the fat and vain secretary of Superintendente Vicente . She is still single and would like to become involved with someone -usually with Mortadelo- , but so far her attempts have been in vain. She is quite touchy her lack of luck with a relationship and being called fat; she reacts with corresponding violence when either of topics are brought up and with her considerable weight, this is nothing to be ignored , she was the first female character created for the series . And the bombshell secretary of the Súper , Mortadelo and Philemon are in love with her -much to Ofelia's chagrin- , but she is not interested .\n\nGood 3D animation film , being well voiced by Janfri Mariano Venancio, Berta Ojea, Emilio Gavira, José Alias, José Manuel Moya José Marín , Janfri Topera played Profesor Bacterio , all of them appeared on the live action 2003 movie . This Computer Generator film , -the Second Ilion Animation Studios' Feature Film- packs thrills , action , comic situations , abstract incidents , at the same time satirizing Spanish society and many other things . After more than four decades entertaining through the comics, the most known couple of detectives are brought to life by means of 3D C.G.I . It was clear from the beginning the difficulty to transfer a cartoon comics to cinema ; however director Javier Fesser gets a charming rendition about our unforgettable memories of childhood and youth . This third adaptation to the cinema of the popular characters of Spanish comic of F.Ibáñez got a big box office similarly the first outing : ¨La Gran Aventura De Mortadelo Y Filemón¨(2003) also directed by Javier Fesser grossing more than 4,750,000 spectators and almost 22 million Euros . However , the second entry titled ¨Mortadelo y Filemón : Misión Salvar Tierra¨ by Miguel Bardem failed at Box office. \n\nAs always , our friend Mortadelo whose favourite hobby is wearing all sorts of sometimes outrageous disguises - professional and historical clothes and gear, animals, inanimate objects, even small-sized vehicles like miniature blimps and mopeds - which he mostly dons for special tasks or when he is on the run from Filemón or his boss, and which all include his signature collar which obscures part of his mouth . And of course , our best friend , Filemón , he only has two hairs on his head and wears a white shirt with a black bow-tie and red trousers. He usually insults Mort because Mort is quite clumsy, but is often at the receiving end of any mishaps which come their way, mostly in the shape of their outraged boss . Other important characters include : Vicente, he is usually called "El Súper" by his underlings . While he, as the head of the organization, lives in splendor, indulging himself in expensive beverages and Cuban cigars, he keeps the T.I.A.'s operatives on an extremely tight budget . He is very short-tempered and he usually gets angry with Mort and Phil because they fail in their missions , leaving a spectacular mess - occasionally at the expense of his own possessions . ¨Professor Bacterio¨ , the T.I.A.'s black-bearded scientist and chief inventor . Mortadelo blames him for his baldness and therefore the doctor is the unwilling prime recipient of Mort's practical jokes . His inventions, which are to assist Mortadelo and Philemon in their assignments, often fail quite spectacularly, mostly because they either achieve the opposite of what they are supposed to do, or work perfectly but fail at the most inconvenient moment , his name comes from bacteria . He holds a grudge against Mortadelo because he used to have lush hair until Bacterio offered him a supposed medicine against baldness, a new hair-strengthening concoction ,which actually made his hair fall out . Other main assets of this flick , along with a beloved tribute to other personages of Francisco Ibáñez as ¨Ofelia¨ nicely voiced by Berta Ojea and special appearance by sympathetic as well as absent-minded "Rompetechos" voiced by Emilio Gavira .\n\n¨Mortadelo Y Filemón Contra Jimmy El Cachondo¨won 29th Goya Awards : Best Adapted Screenplay Javier Fesser, Claro García and Cristóbal Ruiz and Won Best Animated Film , it achieved six Goya nominations and II Premios Feroz : Best Comedy Nominated Best Original Soundtrack Rafael Arnau","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1856,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"genre":["Animation","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-11-28","keywords":"criminal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi581745433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM1OTQ4OWEtZmMzZC00ZDkwLTk5MjUtNDU1NjI0ZWZmN2M0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM1OTQ4OWEtZmMzZC00ZDkwLTk5MjUtNDU1NjI0ZWZmN2M0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253216/","name":"Karra Elejalde"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0867653/","name":"Janfri Topera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2983652/","name":"Gabriel Chame"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275250/","name":"Javier Fesser"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208005/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0599932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0083985/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275250/","name":"Javier Fesser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2195290/","name":"Claro García"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1041385/","name":"Cristóbal Ruiz"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I really can find no solid wrong with the film minus those unexpected moments of adult humor.\n\nHighly recommended. 8/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":129554,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-05-03","keywords":"dog,hunting,competition,pest control,giant vegetable","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3571515673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4YzUxMjAtY2ZhMC00N2NmLWIyYjgtZGZhZTAzZmQ3ZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4YzUxMjAtY2ZhMC00N2NmLWIyYjgtZGZhZTAzZmQ3ZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0758608/","name":"Peter Sallis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000307/","name":"Helena Bonham Carter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000146/","name":"Ralph Fiennes"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101508/","name":"Steve Box","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0661910/","name":"Nick Park"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103531/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101508/","name":"Steve Box","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0661910/","name":"Nick Park","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123666/","name":"Mark Burton"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For "Liberté-Oléron" (2001), this waiting beard fruit. This is perhaps an easier and more conventional movie than "Dieu seul me voit" (1998) but it's much funnier. You can guess in it a satire of the tourists that go on holiday.\n\nThe Podalydès brothers take back the comical recipes that assured them their reputation: situation comedy with embarrassing situations for the characters, especially Denis Podalydès and the other strong point is, of course dialogs with powerful cues.\n\nIf the allusions to Tintin are less numerous (the name of the small boat is "Zigomar" which is a Captain Haddock's insult, Denis and Bruno Podalydès have scattered their script with quite a lot of gags that make the movie refreshing even if some of them have got nothing new and make a few situations predictable.\n\nAs for Denis Podalydès, he's absolutely amazing in his role of greedy and selfish family father. It's only a pity that his performance is sometimes on the verge of third-rate acting.\n\nSo, "Liberté-Oléron" in spite of its weaknesses constitutes a real moment of happiness and the Podalydès brothers are people to follow in French cinema."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-06-20","keywords":"male nudity,male frontal nudity,male rear nudity,male full frontal nudity,vacation","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687914/","name":"Denis Podalydès"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0518653/","name":"Guilaine Londez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684001/","name":"Patrick Pineau"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687913/","name":"Bruno Podalydès"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022244/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687913/","name":"Bruno Podalydès"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687914/","name":"Denis Podalydès"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For "Liberté-Oléron" (2001), this waiting beard fruit. This is perhaps an easier and more conventional movie than "Dieu seul me voit" (1998) but it's much funnier. You can guess in it a satire of the tourists that go on holiday.\n\nThe Podalydès brothers take back the comical recipes that assured them their reputation: situation comedy with embarrassing situations for the characters, especially Denis Podalydès and the other strong point is, of course dialogs with powerful cues.\n\nIf the allusions to Tintin are less numerous (the name of the small boat is "Zigomar" which is a Captain Haddock's insult, Denis and Bruno Podalydès have scattered their script with quite a lot of gags that make the movie refreshing even if some of them have got nothing new and make a few situations predictable.\n\nAs for Denis Podalydès, he's absolutely amazing in his role of greedy and selfish family father. It's only a pity that his performance is sometimes on the verge of third-rate acting.\n\nSo, "Liberté-Oléron" in spite of its weaknesses constitutes a real moment of happiness and the Podalydès brothers are people to follow in French cinema.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-06-20","keywords":"male nudity,male frontal nudity,male rear nudity,male full frontal nudity,vacation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687914/","name":"Denis Podalydès","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0518653/","name":"Guilaine Londez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684001/","name":"Patrick Pineau"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687913/","name":"Bruno Podalydès"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022244/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687913/","name":"Bruno Podalydès","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687914/","name":"Denis Podalydès"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Led by the Queen Tara ( voiced in English-language version by Beyoncé Knowles) the minuscule forest inhabitants guard the essence of creation from the destructive appetite of the agents of blight - creatures called Boggans - and their malevolent leader, Mandrake (Christoph Waltz). These forces of good are led by the seasoned warrior Ronin (Colin Farrell), who together with his elven battalion mount hummingbird steeds.

Visually appeasing with some engaging story lines, apt for parents or simply for adults looking for a good time, are sure to be satisfied by the magical light-hearted tones, just perfect for disassociating yourselves from the mundanity of everyday life.\n\nSome fault can also be found in a somewhat underwhelming formation of characters, mostly feeling like poorly fleshed out cardboard cutouts with only the touching relationship between father and daughter really hitting home. Some of the secondary characters are just poorly conceived comedic relief (like the slug and the snail), while the overall story seems somewhat overloaded given the running time. Especially the character of Nod seems to be a missed concept, as he fails to have enough structure to really develop any relationship with either Ronin or M.K., thus adding a certain sense of superfluousity to his role in the movie.

This is definitely only a simple action flick, but it is well made, the acting is decent, the f/x very good, the film is never tacky, boring or overtly see-through. Enough to keep e viewer interested and entertained while lounging on a couch eating popcorn and drinking beer on a Sunday afternoon. What's wrong with that? In addition, it poses a couple of interesting questions about our current and especially future relationship with machines, the morality of it, etc. These questions will become more and more important as each day passes, and even though the movie does not even attempt to analyze or answer them, it is not unimportant to have posed them. A classical, typically Hollywood-ian ending offers no real solutions, all the wrong certainties and faulty answers, albeit populist ones.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":171635,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-10-07","keywords":"future,robot,year 2017,social commentary,techno thriller","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Surrogates: Internet Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2365915673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MzcxMjUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MzcxMjUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"People are living their lives remotely from the safety of their own homes via robotic surrogates -- sexy, physically perfect mechanical representations of themselves.

This is definitely only a simple action flick, but it is well made, the acting is decent, the f/x very good, the film is never tacky, boring or overtly see-through. Enough to keep e viewer interested and entertained while lounging on a couch eating popcorn and drinking beer on a Sunday afternoon. What's wrong with that? In addition, it poses a couple of interesting questions about our current and especially future relationship with machines, the morality of it, etc. These questions will become more and more important as each day passes, and even though the movie does not even attempt to analyze or answer them, it is not unimportant to have posed them. A classical, typically Hollywood-ian ending offers no real solutions, all the wrong certainties and faulty answers, albeit populist ones.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":171635,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-10-07","keywords":"future,robot,year 2017,social commentary,techno thriller","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Surrogates: Internet Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2365915673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MzcxMjUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MzcxMjUwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzExNDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"People are living their lives remotely from the safety of their own homes via robotic surrogates -- sexy, physically perfect mechanical representations of themselves.

Vincent, a 20-year old geology student from Paris, goes to French Guyana to do an internship at a gold mining company. Taken under the wing of local gold lord Antoine Serra, Vincent quickly falls into the much more lucrative and dangerous world of gold trafficking. From Serra, who acts like a father to him, Vincent learns everything there is to know about the business. Newcomers aren't welcome - Louis, Serra's right hand, makes it clear that he does not trust him. Vincent and Serra start building a camp to explore a gold mine, but tensions rise to a full-fledged war between them and their Brazilian competitors.

 --- Description: Guyane: Created by Fabien Nury. With Mathieu Spinosi, Olivier Rabourdin, Anne Suarez, Flora Bonfanti. Vincent, a 20-year old geology student from Paris, goes to French Guyana to do an internship at a gold mining company. Taken under the wing of local gold lord Antoine Serra, Vincent quickly falls into the much more lucrative and dangerous world of gold trafficking. From Serra, who acts like a father to him, Vincent learns everything there is to know about the business. Newcomers aren't welcome - Louis, Serra's right hand, makes it clear that he does not trust him. Vincent and Serra start building a camp to explore a gold mine, but tensions rise to a full-fledged war between them and their Brazilian competitors. And things get even more complicated when Vincent discovers that the mythical Sarah Bernhard mine is not a legend. The Guyanese jungle is a world where businessmen, gangsters, geologists and soldiers collide, and men kill are killed for a few grams of the precious metal." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt5904172/","name":"Guyane","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGNkODU4YzgtZDJjNC00MTQ3LTk0ZjgtNDQ3OWJmZjA5NGZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzc2NTk0MjQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"Vincent, a 20-year old geology student from Paris, goes to French Guyana to do an internship at a gold mining company.

Sure it's dated today, but still carries it's own weight. This movie while containing some visually stunning cinematography, some how manages to just drag and drag. As others have commented it comes of like a commercial. The special affects don't seem that special. It's like you are watching a commercial with snowboarding and sky diving designed to sell Redbull.

It could be the last big thing we see from Eastwood's career, and if so, then it's not a bad note to go out on, but it's not his best, and it doesn't have to be. He's proven himself a hundred times over, and this is the film he wanted to make. The Mule is a fine movie to watch, and Eastwood plays a very subdued character, unlike his role in Gran Torino where he still had shades of his bad boy past. He's softer, he's passive, he's what you expect a man of this age to be...and in that way, he played it perfectly.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121205,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Vincent Cassel gives a fine performance as the acclaimed artist Paul Gauguin, who unable to sell his paintings in France, leaves his family in Paris to find inspiration for his work on the island of Tahiti.\n\nThere he meets the Tahitian beauty Tehura (Tuhei Adams), who, while living together, begins to pose for Gauguin's paintings and sketches.

Vincent Cassel gives a fine performance as the acclaimed artist Paul Gauguin, who unable to sell his paintings in France, leaves his family in Paris to find inspiration for his work on the island of Tahiti.\n\nThere he meets the Tahitian beauty Tehura (Tuhei Adams), who, while living together, begins to pose for Gauguin's paintings and sketches. However, despite the lush atmospherics of it all, Gauguin finds himself still impoverished, in failing health, and becoming more and possessive and selfish when it comes to young Tehura. The envisioned idyllic life is slipping away.\n\nOverall, despite the powerful performances from Cassel and the debut of Adams, the movie to me just became mostly a slog, although, at times, it seems to come together nicely, but those moments are too few and far between.

You watch in complete disbelief as scenes appear on the screen and die. (* out of * * * *)","reviewBody":"The Whole Ten Yards (2004) is a comedy dead zone. You watch in complete disbelief as scenes appear on the screen and die. Every moment in this movie, begs for a single laugh, and it's as if the actors- -some who were all so promising in the original film, The Whole Nine Yards (2000)- -were promised big paychecks if they were able to tag along with the film's script.\n\nThe Whole Ten Yards assumes that the viewer has some familiarity with the first movie. Bruce Willis returns as Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, who's now living in obscurity with his wife, Jill (Amanda Peet). Both are having problems in their marriage due to (a) Jimmy's erectile dysfunction, (b) Jill's inability to fulfill her lifelong ambition to become a contract killer and (c) Jimmy's transformation into a male-like Martha Sterwart.\n\nMeanwhile Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky's (Matthew Perry) finds that goons have kidnapped his wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), and that they are led by Lazlo Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), the father of the mob boss (also played by Pollak in the original), who was eliminated in the original film. Oz tracks down Jimmy and convinces his old pal to give up cooking and house cleaning and help him in a rescue attempt.\n\nWarner Bros. has been unsuccessful in making mobster-comedy movie sequels. Analyze This (1999) was a funny film, but the idea to make a sequel was unnecessary. The sequel, Analyze That (2002), was an attempt to stretch an idea beyond its natural shelf life.\n\nBut you have to wonder why the filmmakers felt it was a good move to make a sequel to The Whole Nine Yards, or why Matthew Perry, who is playing Chandler (from "Friends") again, is unlikely to have a movie career, and why the film has been toned down to a PG-13 rating (the film cheats us of another view of Peet's breasts).\n\nScreenwriter George Gallo, on the DVD commentary, evidently has no regrets. "I think this movie is very funny," he insists, "I wrote 80 pages of genius." Apparently the scathing reviews and paltry box office have done little to humble him, as he adds, "It's like a homicidal Three Stooges." \n\nWhen Hollywood lackluster sequels are meant to be made, Howard Deutch is the man to call. He's responsible for Neil Simon's The Odd Couple II (1998) and Grumpier Old Men (1995). Deutch has also directed John Hughes-produced film such as The Great Outdoors (1988), Pretty in Pink (1986), and Some Kind of Wonderful (1987). \n\nIn The Whole Ten Yards, there is a scene that makes a reference to Hughes' Planes, Tranes &amp; Automobiles (1987), but let's just say that it was more funnier when Steve Martin and John Candy did it.\n\nBut, if you don't laugh at that, there's Kevin Pollack (again) in one of the most singularly bad performances I have ever seen in a movie. It fails by calling attention to its awfulness. His accent, his voice, his clothes, his clownish makeup all conspire to create a character who brings the movie to a halt every time he appears on the screen.\n\nThere's also the propensity of a 107-year old woman able to pass gas. Surely by now, you must be rolling in the aisles? No? Then, I will mention that Bruce Willis' character is often unpleasant. He puts on an apron and a head cloth during the early scenes, as if such a disguise would do anything other than call attention to himself.\n\nDeutch, on the DVD commentary, is quietly apologetic as he points out all the things he wished he'd changed. "I was always sorry we didn't cut this out, " he says of one scene, "I think the joke is over." And I should mention that some of the film's elements such as the film's violence (for example, a scene where a woman gets a slap to the face) don't blend well with the film's light "comedy." And if you're planning on seeing or watching The Whole Ten Yards someday, let me tell you, it's not worth seeing for a whole ten bucks on the big screen.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You watch in complete disbelief as scenes appear on the screen and die. (* out of * * * *)","reviewBody":"The Whole Ten Yards (2004) is a comedy dead zone. You watch in complete disbelief as scenes appear on the screen and die. Every moment in this movie, begs for a single laugh, and it's as if the actors- -some who were all so promising in the original film, The Whole Nine Yards (2000)- -were promised big paychecks if they were able to tag along with the film's script.\n\nThe Whole Ten Yards assumes that the viewer has some familiarity with the first movie. Bruce Willis returns as Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, who's now living in obscurity with his wife, Jill (Amanda Peet). Both are having problems in their marriage due to (a) Jimmy's erectile dysfunction, (b) Jill's inability to fulfill her lifelong ambition to become a contract killer and (c) Jimmy's transformation into a male-like Martha Sterwart.\n\nMeanwhile Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky's (Matthew Perry) finds that goons have kidnapped his wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), and that they are led by Lazlo Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), the father of the mob boss (also played by Pollak in the original), who was eliminated in the original film. Oz tracks down Jimmy and convinces his old pal to give up cooking and house cleaning and help him in a rescue attempt.\n\nWarner Bros. has been unsuccessful in making mobster-comedy movie sequels. Analyze This (1999) was a funny film, but the idea to make a sequel was unnecessary. The sequel, Analyze That (2002), was an attempt to stretch an idea beyond its natural shelf life.\n\nBut you have to wonder why the filmmakers felt it was a good move to make a sequel to The Whole Nine Yards, or why Matthew Perry, who is playing Chandler (from "Friends") again, is unlikely to have a movie career, and why the film has been toned down to a PG-13 rating (the film cheats us of another view of Peet's breasts).\n\nScreenwriter George Gallo, on the DVD commentary, evidently has no regrets. "I think this movie is very funny," he insists, "I wrote 80 pages of genius." Apparently the scathing reviews and paltry box office have done little to humble him, as he adds, "It's like a homicidal Three Stooges." \n\nWhen Hollywood lackluster sequels are meant to be made, Howard Deutch is the man to call. He's responsible for Neil Simon's The Odd Couple II (1998) and Grumpier Old Men (1995). Deutch has also directed John Hughes-produced film such as The Great Outdoors (1988), Pretty in Pink (1986), and Some Kind of Wonderful (1987). \n\nIn The Whole Ten Yards, there is a scene that makes a reference to Hughes' Planes, Tranes &amp; Automobiles (1987), but let's just say that it was more funnier when Steve Martin and John Candy did it.\n\nBut, if you don't laugh at that, there's Kevin Pollack (again) in one of the most singularly bad performances I have ever seen in a movie. It fails by calling attention to its awfulness. His accent, his voice, his clothes, his clownish makeup all conspire to create a character who brings the movie to a halt every time he appears on the screen.\n\nThere's also the propensity of a 107-year old woman able to pass gas. Surely by now, you must be rolling in the aisles? No? Then, I will mention that Bruce Willis' character is often unpleasant. He puts on an apron and a head cloth during the early scenes, as if such a disguise would do anything other than call attention to himself.\n\nDeutch, on the DVD commentary, is quietly apologetic as he points out all the things he wished he'd changed. "I was always sorry we didn't cut this out, " he says of one scene, "I think the joke is over." And I should mention that some of the film's elements such as the film's violence (for example, a scene where a woman gets a slap to the face) don't blend well with the film's light "comedy." And if you're planning on seeing or watching The Whole Ten Yards someday, let me tell you, it's not worth seeing for a whole ten bucks on the big screen.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Camera!  Action!  What makes a good movie?  Better yet, what makes a great movie?  In my opinion, a great movie should include almost flawless acting, a finely woven and gripping plot, music that is both beautiful and suitable, and great direction. Of course,  mesmerizing visuals and art direction can also contribute to great films.  So, for all the reasons above, I consider "The City Of Lost Children" the best film of 1996.\n\nThe plot of "The City Of Lost Children" is completely original and it never lets your mind wander off to other places.  It also involves quite a few fascinating and somewhat weird characters in a dreary harbor town called "The City Of Lost Children" (hence the title).   One(that is his name) is a slow-minded circus strongman who searches for his adopted little brother who has been kidnapped by a group of henchmen with robotic eyes called the Cyclops.  One's little brother has been kidnapped and taken to a quickly aging mad scientist named Krank so that his dreams may be stolen.  The mad scientist needs the dreams of children so that he will not age so quickly. The source of this problem is a curse that was put upon him.  Because of this curse, his wife is a midget, he cannot dream, and he has seven identical sons (all of whom have a strange sleeping disorder).  In this movie there is somewhat of a subplot that involves a wicked pair of unseparated siamese twin sisters.  These women run a sort of school where they have the children in it steal for them.  One small, but tough, girl named Miette runs away from the school, finds One, and aides him in his search.  When the two women find out about their little thief, they go to Marcello, a retired man who used to run a circus freakshow, to get what they need to catch and kill the little girl and her newfound friend.  Although this plot seems a bit hard to follow, it all fits together perfectly in the end with wondrous results.  To accompany this odd story,  there is a beautiful soundtrack composed by Angelo Badalmenti with one song ("Who Will Take Your Dreams Away") by Marianne Faithful.  This music fits the mood and plot of the story perfectly and stays with you(as does the movie itself) long after the credits have rolled.\n\nThe casting director of "The City Of Lost Children", Pierre-Jacques Benochou, sure knew what he was doing, because there is not one poor (or mediocre one, for that matter) performance in the whole film.  In fact, I might just say all the performances were virtually flawless.  Ron Perlman's performance as the slow and dimwitted circus strongman One is beautifully acted.  Mr. Perlman should especially be recognized because he is an American actor and this is a subtitled French film.  Daniel Emilfork as the depressed and dreamless mad scientist with a short temper is outstanding and most believable.  Dominique Pinon is wonderful (perhaps the best actor in the whole movie) as the seven rubberfaced identical brothers (yes, he does play all of them, and with fantastic results, too).  The two different actresses who portray the siamese twins, Odile Mallet and Genevieve Brunet, are perfectly wicked and their timing is impeccable.  Last, but not least, the children, with Judith Vittet as Miette in a stand-out performance, all carry out their roles with smashing results.\n\nAnother reason for me choosing "The City Of Lost Children" as the best movie of 1996 is its stunning direction.  This movie was directed by the famous French directing team of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro(a.k.a. "Jeunet and Caro").  The camera angles that are used during the course of this film are a totally different experience and they keep you mesmerized from start to finish.  The directors of this film are, in my opinion, masters of the camera.  The visuals in this movie also contributed to my conclusion that this is the best movie of 1996.  Whatever it might have been, whether the bleak and unique use of colors or the special effects, I was absolutely captivated by what I was seeing on the screen.  What I particularly liked about this film's special effects was that they were not the typical flashy and in-your-face computer special effects that some of today's blockbusters and other genre films seem to have.  I think such special effects distract you from the rest of the movie.  On the contrary, the special effects of "The City Of Lost Children," however, are very subtle.  A final thing I liked about this film were its sets.  From the waterlogged streets of the dank and moldy town to the spectacular gadgetry of Krank's laboratories everything was a magnificent panorama for the eye to behold.\n\nWas the plot great?  Yes.  How was the acting?  Outstanding.  Was the direction done well?  Definitely.  How did the visuals appear?  They were beautifully presented.  From what you have read, whether you have concluded to avoid this movie completely or go out and rent it right away (I do understand that this movie does have a select audience), I am hopeful that you understand the picture I am trying to paint.  Even if the story will not appeal to you, it is still splendidly done.  Overall, though, "The City Of Lost Children" is definitely the best movie of 1996 for me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66486,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1995-05-17","keywords":"psychotronic film,underwater scene,children,dream,aging","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The City of Lost Children","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4236902681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlkNTAzY2MtNmVjYS00Mzk5LWJlNGYtNzI1N2JhZDgwMmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlkNTAzY2MtNmVjYS00Mzk5LWJlNGYtNzI1N2JhZDgwMmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256399/","name":"Daniel Emilfork"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900136/","name":"Judith Vittet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054943/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0545615/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012496/","name":"Gilles Adrien"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I had no idea about the plot and was happily led by Wilson's character into the depths of Paris' magical midnight strike. Other actor's involved did a great job too. I was particularly impressed with McAdams as it just adds to her ability to play any role. I think overall I'm simply in awe at the film. It's a classic. A really refreshing idea, gently portrayed in an almost realistic way, like this French magic really does exist. The music and scenery adds to the charm of the film and the subtle humour is a nice touch too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and will watch this over and over again for years to come.

I had no idea about the plot and was happily led by Wilson's character into the depths of Paris' magical midnight strike. Other actor's involved did a great job too. I was particularly impressed with McAdams as it just adds to her ability to play any role. I think overall I'm simply in awe at the film. It's a classic. A really refreshing idea, gently portrayed in an almost realistic way, like this French magic really does exist. The music and scenery adds to the charm of the film and the subtle humour is a nice touch too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone and will watch this over and over again for years to come. Along with Manhattan, Match Point, Annie Hall....","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":401549,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-05-11","keywords":"time travel romance,1920s,nostalgia,reference to auguste rodin,art history","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Midnight in Paris","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi853581081","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjNkOTFmZDctNWZmZS00MDhhLWJmZDctODkwNjcyYzkzNTg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjNkOTFmZDctNWZmZS00MDhhLWJmZDctODkwNjcyYzkzNTg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"On vacation in Paris, a married man who is somewhat of a killjoy slowly falls in love ... with the city itself.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1046097/","name":"Rachel McAdams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000870/","name":"Kathy Bates"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000095/","name":"Woody Allen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002375/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0224201/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044777/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000095/","name":"Woody Allen"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Most 12 year olds don't have a job. Perhaps their parents have assigned a few chores around the house to help them learn responsibility, but for the most part, they go to school and play ... the things that kids do. Shia LaBeouf had 2 jobs as a kid. He was a rising actor and he was employer/quasi-guardian of his father. Now in his 30's, LaBeouf has written a screenplay about his childhood and he stars as his father in an attempt to exorcise some personal demons. It also happens to make for compelling cinema.\n\nThe film opens with a montage of cuts between a 20-something LeBeouf (played by Oscar nominee Lucas Hedges) performing stunts on an action movie set (clearly meant to represent TRANSFORMERS) and a serious automobile wreck and subsequent DUI. The wreck caused major damage to his hand and resulted in court-mandated rehabilitation. While in rehab, his therapist (played by Laura San Giacomo) diagnoses him with PTSD ... not military war related, but rather broken family related.\n\nIn this film, LeBeouf has named the character based on himself Otis, and the character based on his own father James Lort. In addition to Hedges playing the early-20's version, another rising actor, Noah Jupe, plays Otis as a 12 year old. As rehabbing Otis puts his childhood memories to paper, we see flashbacks featuring the younger Otis and his father. They live in a dump of a motel, and ride to the TV show set (meant to be "Even Stevens") on dad's motorcycle. James Lort/dad is a former performing clown, recovering addict, and ex-con. He's the kind of guy who talks a big game and blames everyone else for keeping him from succeeding. To put it mildly ... he's a jerk. That's not to say he doesn't have his moments as a caring parent, but those moments are nullified by the bullying and threats of violence towards his young son. That son is desperate to please his dad, yet wise enough to know that he's not to be trusted.\n\nShia LeBeouf dives in head first to play the man who had such an impact on his early years. This, mind you, is the kind of man who offers cigarettes to his young son, makes fun of his pre-pubescent body, and is quite jealous of his budding career. LeBeouf is at his best in a difficult role that surely cuts very deep for him. Supporting roles are played by singer FKA Twigs as the shy neighbor girl who befriends Otis, plus Natasha Lyonne, Maika Monroe, Clifton Collins Jr, and Byron Bowers.\n\nDirector Alma Har'el structures her first narrative feature film (she has previously worked on videos and documentaries) with timelines showing Otis at the two ages. There are no fancy camera tricks. Instead she trusts these talented actors to bring it home ... and that they do very well.

Most 12 year olds don't have a job. Perhaps their parents have assigned a few chores around the house to help them learn responsibility, but for the most part, they go to school and play ... the things that kids do. Shia LaBeouf had 2 jobs as a kid. He was a rising actor and he was employer/quasi-guardian of his father. Now in his 30's, LaBeouf has written a screenplay about his childhood and he stars as his father in an attempt to exorcise some personal demons. It also happens to make for compelling cinema.\n\nThe film opens with a montage of cuts between a 20-something LeBeouf (played by Oscar nominee Lucas Hedges) performing stunts on an action movie set (clearly meant to represent TRANSFORMERS) and a serious automobile wreck and subsequent DUI. The wreck caused major damage to his hand and resulted in court-mandated rehabilitation. While in rehab, his therapist (played by Laura San Giacomo) diagnoses him with PTSD ... not military war related, but rather broken family related.\n\nIn this film, LeBeouf has named the character based on himself Otis, and the character based on his own father James Lort. In addition to Hedges playing the early-20's version, another rising actor, Noah Jupe, plays Otis as a 12 year old. As rehabbing Otis puts his childhood memories to paper, we see flashbacks featuring the younger Otis and his father. They live in a dump of a motel, and ride to the TV show set (meant to be "Even Stevens") on dad's motorcycle. James Lort/dad is a former performing clown, recovering addict, and ex-con. He's the kind of guy who talks a big game and blames everyone else for keeping him from succeeding. To put it mildly ... he's a jerk. That's not to say he doesn't have his moments as a caring parent, but those moments are nullified by the bullying and threats of violence towards his young son. That son is desperate to please his dad, yet wise enough to know that he's not to be trusted.\n\nShia LeBeouf dives in head first to play the man who had such an impact on his early years. This, mind you, is the kind of man who offers cigarettes to his young son, makes fun of his pre-pubescent body, and is quite jealous of his budding career. LeBeouf is at his best in a difficult role that surely cuts very deep for him. Supporting roles are played by singer FKA Twigs as the shy neighbor girl who befriends Otis, plus Natasha Lyonne, Maika Monroe, Clifton Collins Jr, and Byron Bowers.\n\nDirector Alma Har'el structures her first narrative feature film (she has previously worked on videos and documentaries) with timelines showing Otis at the two ages. There are no fancy camera tricks. Instead she trusts these talented actors to bring it home ... and that they do very well. Lucas Hedges was Oscar nominated for MANCHESTER BY THE SEA, and he is in the beautiful upcoming film WAVES. Noah Jupe is a star in the making, having previously appeared in A QUIET PLACE, and in the exhilarating upcoming film FORD VS FERRARI. These are some top notch actors at their very best.\n\nAs viewers, we have to remove ourselves from feeling anger and disgust towards the James Lort character. That's easier said than done when he says things like "The only thing my father gave me of any value was pain." It's meant to sum up his reasoning for his own parenting approach. There is a truly brilliant, and well-coordinated scene that acts as a three-way phone conversation between father, son, and estranged wife/mother. The kid is put smack in the middle of the two people who are supposed to love and nurture and protect him. Instead, Otis comes across as the adult.

Did diplomats and politicians really behave like this? Not only did they behave like this. They continue to behave like this. I've worked in government NGOs overseas and I've seen the insincerity of most diplomats close up. I've also experienced their ability to blind themselves of the truth if the truth endangers their high paid positions.\n\nThere are people out there now who know the truth and who are being told to keep quiet. There are people I've known who were undermined when trying to do what was right. So, this movie is telling the truth for them. You may not like what it has to say, but who says the truth has to be pleasant.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7885,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT2H21M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even those who watch it, may feel the situations it portrays are exaggerated or completely made up. They are not. The problems caused by Stalin in Ukraine are, if anything, downplayed.\n\nBut beyond the historical accuracy are the questions about the behavior of the people and their morality as it is portrayed in the film. Did diplomats and politicians really behave like this? Not only did they behave like this. They continue to behave like this. I've worked in government NGOs overseas and I've seen the insincerity of most diplomats close up. I've also experienced their ability to blind themselves of the truth if the truth endangers their high paid positions.\n\nThere are people out there now who know the truth and who are being told to keep quiet. There are people I've known who were undermined when trying to do what was right. So, this movie is telling the truth for them. You may not like what it has to say, but who says the truth has to be pleasant.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7885,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H21M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The handsome, entitled Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) is here with his beautiful bride, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario).  Shane and Rachel are in the throes of young love, but as they get to know each other better in this new, intimate environment, clouds of doubt appear - and by the time Shane's intrusive mother, Kitty (Molly Shannon) surprises them with an unwelcome visit, their fairytale honeymoon has begun to unravel. And finally, there is Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy, unstable woman, recovering from the death of her mother, traveling alone to the hotel, looking for love and in desperate need of a massage."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you are interested in history or art I would highly recommend it but for the casual viewer I am afraid this movie might be too dull.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2110,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-11-20","keywords":"one word title,world war two,nazi,painter,art","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3152527641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVmNWY0OGUtOGE4ZS00OWZkLTllNGItMDk3YmI4Zjg1MTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVmNWY0OGUtOGE4ZS00OWZkLTllNGItMDk3YmI4Zjg1MTc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"While Joseph Piller (Bang), a Dutch Jew, was fighting in the Resistance during the Second World War, the witty, debonair aesthete, Han van Meegeren (Pearce) was hosting hedonistic soirées and selling Dutch art treasures to Hermann Goring and other top Nazis.

But, despite mounting evidence, Piller, with the aid of his assistant (Krieps), becomes increasingly convinced of Han's innocence and finds himself in the unlikely position of fighting to save his life.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001602/","name":"Guy Pearce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0051903/","name":"Claes Bang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3043279/","name":"Vicky Krieps"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6679051/","name":"Dan Friedkin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0473978/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0241129/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0650089/","name":"John Orloff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1318843/","name":"Mark Fergus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1319757/","name":"Hawk Ostby"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished.

Compared to the animation in Yamato (which is flat and often motionless), Lupin is Snow White.  There is so much movement (more than some of Miyazaki's later films), and there are some truly incredible "set" pieces (Lupin scaling a sheer castle wall, for instance).  One of the things that has always been noted about Japanese animation is that while it's not as fluid as Disney animation (12 frames per second as opposed to 24, not to mention the animation is generally before the voice track), it has incredible style and originality in its design and cinematography.  Lupin is a perfect example of this, and it's no wonder the movie is still so well revered in Japan.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28840,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1979-12-15","keywords":"ring,treasure,counterfeit money,damsel in distress,castle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Castle of Cagliostro","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2743730457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJiY2VlZGQtNjI1Mi00NTgwLWEyOGUtOTAwZDFlYzI2Mjg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJiY2VlZGQtNjI1Mi00NTgwLWEyOGUtOTAwZDFlYzI2Mjg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0945280/","name":"Yasuo Yamada"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0557968/","name":"Eiko Masuyama"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462017/","name":"Kiyoshi Kobayashi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0594503/","name":"Hayao Miyazaki"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064579/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0700578/","name":"Monkey Punch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0594503/","name":"Hayao Miyazaki"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500897/","name":"Haruya Yamazaki"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Compared to the animation in Yamato (which is flat and often motionless), Lupin is Snow White.  There is so much movement (more than some of Miyazaki's later films), and there are some truly incredible "set" pieces (Lupin scaling a sheer castle wall, for instance).  One of the things that has always been noted about Japanese animation is that while it's not as fluid as Disney animation (12 frames per second as opposed to 24, not to mention the animation is generally before the voice track), it has incredible style and originality in its design and cinematography.  Lupin is a perfect example of this, and it's no wonder the movie is still so well revered in Japan.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28840,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1979-12-15","keywords":"ring,treasure,counterfeit money,damsel in distress,castle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Castle of Cagliostro","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2743730457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJiY2VlZGQtNjI1Mi00NTgwLWEyOGUtOTAwZDFlYzI2Mjg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJiY2VlZGQtNjI1Mi00NTgwLWEyOGUtOTAwZDFlYzI2Mjg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0945280/","name":"Yasuo Yamada","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0557968/","name":"Eiko Masuyama","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462017/","name":"Kiyoshi Kobayashi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0594503/","name":"Hayao Miyazaki"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064579/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0700578/","name":"Monkey Punch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0594503/","name":"Hayao Miyazaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500897/","name":"Haruya Yamazaki"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Why a woman director would reduce an evidently very intelligent and interesting woman to a pouting bundle of uncontrolled emotions I do not know.\n\nIf you were to believe this movie - and you shouldn't - there really wasn't much to Fuller's art. Nothing like ballet, or modern dance, or jazz dancing, or ... Just twirling around, waving her robes, while different colored lights and background mirrors enhanced the effect. \n\nSo we are left with her life. If it was at all as it is presented in the movie, and there is no reason to assume that that was the case, it was pretty miserable. We see that she spends lots of time building up her shoulder muscles so she can keep waving those robes, with the result that her arms often hurt. The light from the colored light hurts her eyes. She ends up in several confusing and bad relationships. A rough life, in other words. But the movie does nothing to make us care.\n\nThis movie needed a MUCH better script to make us understand and sympathize with Fuller. Otherwise, except for the few moments when she goes into her dance, it's just a lot of uncontrolled emotions that we have no reason to care about.

But as film itself goes, it rates a 6. History saves this film. The depiction of the work of the paleolithic art is accurate, though somewhat blurred in its depiction. The background of this film was too drawn out however, to allow for a better rating. It steers to closely to a Hallmark movie, rather than a dramatic historic narrative. To me, when actual historic dialog is lacking, as little as possible should be added to fill in the blanks. I almost stopped watching it due to the tedium of the dialogue. The acting was good. It was probably Banderas's best work since the 13th warrior. He was very believable in the role of Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola. Though his accent still detracts from his performance, even in a Spanish role. Rupert Everett shows once again his great talent. It is sad that his attitude has led to the downfall of his career. The other character actors were somewhat bland but acceptable. As it is the case with any historical film, that teaches as well as entertains, the audience and mankind can only benefit. A must watch for amateur historians.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2663,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2016-04-01","keywords":"cave,discovery,father daughter relationship,19th century,spain","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Finding Altamira","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi760264473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyOGYzM2ItMzEwNC00Nzg1LThiYTItZjI2ZjhlYWYxZTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyOGYzM2ItMzEwNC00Nzg1LThiYTItZjI2ZjhlYWYxZTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Finding Altamira"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0796316/","name":"Clément Sibony"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000391/","name":"Rupert Everett"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0399853/","name":"Hugh Hudson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0585110/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0523978/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0663878/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381757/","name":"Olivia Hetreed"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006856/","name":"José Luis López-Linares"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But as film itself goes, it rates a 6. History saves this film. The depiction of the work of the paleolithic art is accurate, though somewhat blurred in its depiction. The background of this film was too drawn out however, to allow for a better rating. It steers to closely to a Hallmark movie, rather than a dramatic historic narrative. To me, when actual historic dialog is lacking, as little as possible should be added to fill in the blanks. I almost stopped watching it due to the tedium of the dialogue. The acting was good. It was probably Banderas's best work since the 13th warrior. He was very believable in the role of Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola. Though his accent still detracts from his performance, even in a Spanish role. Rupert Everett shows once again his great talent. It is sad that his attitude has led to the downfall of his career. The other character actors were somewhat bland but acceptable. As it is the case with any historical film, that teaches as well as entertains, the audience and mankind can only benefit. A must watch for amateur historians.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2663,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2016-04-01","keywords":"cave,discovery,father daughter relationship,19th century,spain","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Finding Altamira","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi760264473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyOGYzM2ItMzEwNC00Nzg1LThiYTItZjI2ZjhlYWYxZTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyOGYzM2ItMzEwNC00Nzg1LThiYTItZjI2ZjhlYWYxZTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Finding Altamira","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0796316/","name":"Clément Sibony","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000391/","name":"Rupert Everett"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0399853/","name":"Hugh Hudson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0585110/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0523978/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0663878/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381757/","name":"Olivia Hetreed","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006856/","name":"José Luis López-Linares"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Madagascar 3 is not a movie I deem perfect, there is some suggestive dialogue during King Julien's romance especially(and in other parts of the film) that will fly over children's heads and only adults will get(same goes with the glove slap) and you do have to suspend disbelief a bit in Alex's dream when the penguins use warp drive for their airship(which you can't do in the earth's atmosphere), especially if you are a scientist.\n\nOn the other hand, it is a fun and hugely enjoyable film. It is the best-looking of the three films, the previous two looked great as well but here the characters move easier, the colours have brightness and warmth and the backgrounds have a great deal of detail. Especially of note is the animation during Katy Perry's Fireworks, splendid in all regards. The soundtrack is also great, varied in that it spans 30 years and full of exuberance. Firework I am not a fan of, but loved the animation and thought it fitted really well within the film. The dialogue is well written and hilarious, with light, subtle spoofing on other films and also on the Hollywood clichés.\n\nThe story is well paced, exciting and of the three Madagascar it is the most consistent and least predictable. King Julien's romance was on the bizarre side, but also sweet and hilarious. The characters are great fun, of the four main characters Alex is the most dominant and he's fun. Marty, Gloria and Melman don't have as much to do but they aren't completely side-lined. The penguins and King Julien steal every scene they're in. And the new characters are just delightful, especially Vitaly and DuBois. The voice acting is top notch, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith and David Schwimmer all do very appealing jobs. Sacha Baron Cohen is as witty as ever as King Julien, likewise with the penguins with Tom McGrath standing out as Skipper. The dogs are fun too. Bryan Cranston is subtly menacing, Jessica Chastain is charming and Martin Short is funny, but the jewel(and possibly the best single voice-over of the three movies) is Frances McDormand, whose DuBois is note-perfect.\n\nIn conclusion, a very good sequel and movie and my vote for the best of the Madagascar movies. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":169583,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-06-13","keywords":"animal,circus,penguin,lemur,giraffe","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1169137689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTkxMDU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU0NzIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTkxMDU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU0NzIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo join a traveling circus in an effort to get back home to New York."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000586/","name":"Jada Pinkett Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001674/","name":"Chris Rock"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201509/","name":"Eric Darnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569891/","name":"Tom McGrath"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0970447/","name":"Conrad Vernon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201509/","name":"Eric Darnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000876/","name":"Noah Baumbach"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123666/","name":"Mark Burton"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Some of the user reviews here didn't seem very enthusiastic about the movie either. I'm 67, retired, and a King fan (I've red The Dark Tower books). My wife is 70, retired and not a King fan (she hasn't read any of the Dark Tower books). Just to provide some additional perspective some of the movies we've seen so far this year and how we rated (in chronological order) The Founder 5, A Dog's Purpose 5, John Wick Chapter 2 5, Logan 6, Kong; Skull Island 7, Beauty and the Beast 7, Power Rangers 5, The Fate of the Furious 8, Guardians of the Galaxy 2nd Vol 8, Pirates of the Caribbean 4, Wonder Woman 9, The Mummy 5, Spider Man 6, War for the Planet of the Apes 8, and The Dark Tower 8.\n\nI was worried standing in line to see the movie so when the previous show got out I started asking people (must have been close to 20) if the liked the show. (Would have asked more except my wife was feeling a little embarrassed.) Everyone said a hearty "Yes" except for one couple who shook their heads and said, "It wasn't like the books" and gave it a thumbs down. After that I was encouraged and looked forward to seeing the movie. I figured most of the critics were slamming it because it didn't follow the books closely. Frankly, from what I've seen, King books have always had a tough time being translated to the big screen. \n\nAlthough this movie didn't follow the books "right on" the main gist of the plot and characters were there so I wasn't disappointed. Contrary to what some other critical and user reviews have said, the plot was cohesive, well thought out, and had similarities to the book. The acting was very well done all around, the action was excellent and was not jittery or blurry. It's easy to connect to the characters and the emotional points of the plot.\n\nI started with a list of movies we've seen and how we rated so you can compare how similar, or not, your ratings were to put in perspective how likely you'd be to enjoy this movie. I wonder if critics and some users go to movies for reasons different from ours. We just want to see fun, entertaining, well acted movies that have been filmed and directed by good professionals. The ONLY ding we could give this movie was that it wasn't done in a manner similar to "Lord of the Rings" where it's carried out over 3 films with greater detail and depth. That might have been better, but maybe not. Regardless, I wish critics would at least rate movies like this with 2 stars as long as they're fun, well done and entertaining. There's no way this was a one-star film.\n\nUnless you really need the movie to follow all the outline and plot of the books, I'm extremely confident you'll enjoy this movie. It's well worth going to the show to see.

DCI Bank's emotional expressions were frequently inappropriate, immature for a DCI for sure and downright ridiculous at times. I mean the last scene of the first episode was eye rolling. Then you have the Catz character. One minute\n\nDCI Banks and her are meeting and the next they're drinking and conversing like old lovers. The plot was uneven, all over the place. I can't take this show seriously after that mess. No flow, no depth or believability with characters. Focused on irrelevant aspects and ignored proper tension building and story flow. Probably one of the most disjointed detective shows I've ever seen.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6541,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-09-27","keywords":"police detective,murder mystery,british police,police procedural,yorkshire","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0867017/","name":"Stephen Tompkinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0212675/","name":"Jack Deam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0522882/","name":"Andrea Lowe"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208971/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015194/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dci Banks","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi661765401","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkxY2NhYmUtMDhiYy00MDM1LWFhZWEtYTg3MzUzNmNjZDhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkxY2NhYmUtMDhiYy00MDM1LWFhZWEtYTg3MzUzNmNjZDhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Dci Banks"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A great movie after the first one. MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt's life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt's dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films. The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt's super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.\n\nThe acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn't have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them. Tom Cruise grew as an actor and it showed if his performance from first two filmshas to be considered. I wish the movie was less predictable and avoided the cliches. It's a good movie to pass your time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":336114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H6M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm not a big fan of subtitled series, but I found the lead role's mohawk haircut interesting enough to keep me tuned in for longer than usual. The rest is history. Once you start watching Gennnaro Savastano (played by Salvatore Esposito) you will be addicted. The macho man of all macho men, he looks like he could burst you with one right hook. As if one magnetic actor wasn't enough, along comes Salvatore Conte (played by Marco Palvetti), a suave slickster with an instantly addictive accent and way of expressing himself. The action is constantly moving at perfect pace, the settings are beautifully contrasted. Everything about this series is brilliant, even the bit-part players are magnetic, one such character brilliantly named Tonino Spiderman. This is a must-own series for all gangster movie/TV series buffs, and the great thing about it is, not a lot of people know just how mind-blowingly brilliant it is.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32094,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In these very early years the disease was still searching for a name and it was known only as a gay disease. After death after death a newspaper reporter Ned Weeks(in a super performance from Mark Ruffalo)starts to become an activist and fight for the rights of gay men and he faces a big climb from the political and medical community who both seem in denial of gay men's rights and they have no clue on how to treat the disease. Ned sees the pain and toll that it takes as his lover Felix(Matt Bomer)falls to defeat in the end from this new mysterious killer of gay men. In an outstanding performance veteran Julia Roberts is high strong and determined as a polio stricken doctor Brookner who was one of the first in the country to treat gay men for this disease. She has hope and fights for change. Overall this film is a painful watch about life, love, and in the end death still it's message is it's okay to fight for life and equal justice even if your different and love one of your own gender.

His first super-hero project, 'Kick Ass,' opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film's ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with 'X-Men: First Class,' an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.\n\nSet within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960's, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him. But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity as a whole.\n\nInstantly where 'X-Men: First Class' works is in regards to its two central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward. Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes, Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race, his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it's this development which drives the plot forward.\n\nAside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960's X-Men universe. With a modest running time at two hours and ten minutes, there are more than a few well-choreographed action sequences that would adequately satisfy any of comic-book-to-film aficionado's wishing to see this film. Each character's power or ability is at some point represented in a destructive or defensive capacity, taking full advantage of the fact that while many super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature of the artillery characters can be seen to withstand from governmental agencies or blindsided human opponents, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that human reaction would be futile due to the overwhelming power the mutants possess. These scenes also allow the less important characters to show their physical presence on-screen. For example, during the climactic fight sequence at the conclusion of the film, every mutant character that is identified to the audience is finally shown using their abilities to full capacity, most notably the henchmen of Shaw and the rag-tag team of Xavier and Lehnsherr. This therefore accounts slightly for the lack of depth that has been attempted in these secondary characters due to the time and story constraints.\n\nWhile it is a very good and accessible comic-book/super-hero movie, 'X-Men' does also contain two central flaws. The first is superseded in a way by the strength of both McAvoy and Fassbenders performances, as Kevin Bacon is constantly overshadowed as the one-dimensional antagonist of the piece. His plot to ultimately destroy humanity becomes second fiddle to the ever intricate complex relationship between Xavier and Lehnsherr, and his appearance seems too modelled upon that of a James Bond villain. He has the slick hair, the beautiful women and the villainous underground Club to boot, but Bacon unfortunately doesn't have the charisma to be accepted as a worthy opponent to the protagonists. The other flaw has to do with a minor aspect of the production itself, as the non-diegetic music, most notably during the action sequences, begins to diminish in its impact as the film carries on, leading to it eventually becoming the generic, genre-related fanfare associated with the conventional comic-book films.\n\n'X-Men: First Class,' is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film's core instead of the action-set-pieces taking place, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience members.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":655044,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His first super-hero project, 'Kick Ass,' opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film's ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with 'X-Men: First Class,' an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.\n\nSet within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960's, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him. But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity as a whole.\n\nInstantly where 'X-Men: First Class' works is in regards to its two central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward. Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes, Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race, his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it's this development which drives the plot forward.\n\nAside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960's X-Men universe. With a modest running time at two hours and ten minutes, there are more than a few well-choreographed action sequences that would adequately satisfy any of comic-book-to-film aficionado's wishing to see this film. Each character's power or ability is at some point represented in a destructive or defensive capacity, taking full advantage of the fact that while many super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature of the artillery characters can be seen to withstand from governmental agencies or blindsided human opponents, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that human reaction would be futile due to the overwhelming power the mutants possess. These scenes also allow the less important characters to show their physical presence on-screen. For example, during the climactic fight sequence at the conclusion of the film, every mutant character that is identified to the audience is finally shown using their abilities to full capacity, most notably the henchmen of Shaw and the rag-tag team of Xavier and Lehnsherr. This therefore accounts slightly for the lack of depth that has been attempted in these secondary characters due to the time and story constraints.\n\nWhile it is a very good and accessible comic-book/super-hero movie, 'X-Men' does also contain two central flaws. The first is superseded in a way by the strength of both McAvoy and Fassbenders performances, as Kevin Bacon is constantly overshadowed as the one-dimensional antagonist of the piece. His plot to ultimately destroy humanity becomes second fiddle to the ever intricate complex relationship between Xavier and Lehnsherr, and his appearance seems too modelled upon that of a James Bond villain. He has the slick hair, the beautiful women and the villainous underground Club to boot, but Bacon unfortunately doesn't have the charisma to be accepted as a worthy opponent to the protagonists. The other flaw has to do with a minor aspect of the production itself, as the non-diegetic music, most notably during the action sequences, begins to diminish in its impact as the film carries on, leading to it eventually becoming the generic, genre-related fanfare associated with the conventional comic-book films.\n\n'X-Men: First Class,' is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film's core instead of the action-set-pieces taking place, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience members.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":655044,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So what?  I didn't expect a companion piece like The Godfather Part II.  Die Hard was about a really cool guy in a really bad situation, and the result was probably the greatest action movie ever made.  Die Hard 2 achieves status on its own just by being about the same thing. When so many movies want to be Die Hard but fail, why not just make another Die Hard? Director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger)realized that because it's a sequel, there had to be more stunts and explosions. So there is.  Die Hard 2 (appropriately called Die Harder) ups the ante a bit and has fun with a flurry of furious action scenarios.  The fight on the wing of the plane is a classic in its own right, and Die Hard 2 stands alone as one of the best of the genre."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":343362,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So what?  I didn't expect a companion piece like The Godfather Part II.  Die Hard was about a really cool guy in a really bad situation, and the result was probably the greatest action movie ever made.  Die Hard 2 achieves status on its own just by being about the same thing. When so many movies want to be Die Hard but fail, why not just make another Die Hard? Director Renny Harlin (Cliffhanger)realized that because it's a sequel, there had to be more stunts and explosions. So there is.  Die Hard 2 (appropriately called Die Harder) ups the ante a bit and has fun with a flurry of furious action scenarios.  The fight on the wing of the plane is a classic in its own right, and Die Hard 2 stands alone as one of the best of the genre.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":343362,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That's why he'll guide Clayton through the difficult training courses and helps him to quickly rise through the ranks.

I'm not saying it is a masterpiece, but this is still a movie with Al Pacino and Colin Farrell. Both actors and especially Al Pacino are normally good for some decent fun and some good acting and it wasn't any different in this movie.\n\nThis movie tells us the story of James Clayton (Colin Farrell), a young computer graduate who is recruited by Walter Burke (Al Pacino) to work for the CIA. Despite Clayton's unconventional attitude, Burke sees in him one of the best agents the CIA can wish for. That's why he'll guide Clayton through the difficult training courses and helps him to quickly rise through the ranks. Once the training period is over Clayton gets a special assignment, he'll have to detect a mole that has infiltrated in the CIA.

I'm not saying it is a masterpiece, but this is still a movie with Al Pacino and Colin Farrell. Both actors and especially Al Pacino are normally good for some decent fun and some good acting and it wasn't any different in this movie.\n\nThis movie tells us the story of James Clayton (Colin Farrell), a young computer graduate who is recruited by Walter Burke (Al Pacino) to work for the CIA. Despite Clayton's unconventional attitude, Burke sees in him one of the best agents the CIA can wish for. That's why he'll guide Clayton through the difficult training courses and helps him to quickly rise through the ranks. Once the training period is over Clayton gets a special assignment, he'll have to detect a mole that has infiltrated in the CIA. But will his training be enough and was Burke right about the fact that this may well be the best agent ever?\n\nThis movie is perhaps not the most original thriller ever, but it delivers everything that it is asked for.

For a movie with a lot of shooting and one- liners, it's the kind you can just become immersed in. This is pure entertainment. Parts may get a little outrageous and a tad predictable.

There are obviously some minor differences but if you have read it before, you'll smile hearing some lines taken directly from the comic. Washington's casting is a bit of a departure.

These two made the movie fun.\n\nYou're probably aware this isn't a piece of fine art. It's not meant to be. Usually at this point in the summer, all the "big" Hollywood movies have been released.

Those two could have easily carried the burden of being the box office draw. We are also treated to great performances by Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos, James Marsden and Paula Patton. That's what makes the movie even more of a pleasant surprise. You get a sense that some thought and care was put into the making of this movie. Not only is it faithful to the comic, the filmmakers also made sure it had a great cast and delivered a really good quality production.\n\nThe movie is rated R. Clearly there is quite a bit of violence. There's plenty of shooting, killing and explosions. It gets a little over the top but that's what you should expect from this kind of movie. There is also some brief nudity and plenty of profanity. In other words, this isn't a family film. What it is is a movie you go see with your friends. Buy some popcorn, lean back in your seat and just enjoy the movie and have a great time.\n\nI mentioned leaving the theater with a smile. It's not a "feel good" movie. But it will make you laugh and give you a good time. That's exactly what I want for my money. It's fun and absurd with over the top action. Do I want a sequel? Boom!

And the geography? The location of the buildings don't match up. The costumes, Ottoman swords are completely wrong. And Mehmed II, the future conqueror of Constatinople was also 10 years old at that time, but he magically grew up I guess. When Ottoman characters speak Turkish, it sounds like my French students who've just started learning the language. How cringy is that, like, really, could they at least not find the actors proper dialect coaches so that they could be a bit more convincing while pronouncing these two sentences?\n\nIf they think they can sell trash to the audience and not respect them, long live paid streaming channels.

And there's nothing wrong with creating a fictional story based on myths and legends. But when you say Beijing is in Alaska, and the Chinese character in the movie sounds French, there's no way you can sell this cringeworthy, embarassing movie to an audience, who thankfully has access to internet and can look up for the facts.\n\nIt's said that the year is 1442, but the real Vlad the Impaler was 11 years old at that time. And the geography? The location of the buildings don't match up. The costumes, Ottoman swords are completely wrong. And Mehmed II, the future conqueror of Constatinople was also 10 years old at that time, but he magically grew up I guess. When Ottoman characters speak Turkish, it sounds like my French students who've just started learning the language. How cringy is that, like, really, could they at least not find the actors proper dialect coaches so that they could be a bit more convincing while pronouncing these two sentences?\n\nIf they think they can sell trash to the audience and not respect them, long live paid streaming channels. We don't have a dime to pay for a two hour long idiocracy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":184050,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And the geography? The location of the buildings don't match up. The costumes, Ottoman swords are completely wrong. And Mehmed II, the future conqueror of Constatinople was also 10 years old at that time, but he magically grew up I guess. When Ottoman characters speak Turkish, it sounds like my French students who've just started learning the language. How cringy is that, like, really, could they at least not find the actors proper dialect coaches so that they could be a bit more convincing while pronouncing these two sentences?\n\nIf they think they can sell trash to the audience and not respect them, long live paid streaming channels.

And there's nothing wrong with creating a fictional story based on myths and legends. But when you say Beijing is in Alaska, and the Chinese character in the movie sounds French, there's no way you can sell this cringeworthy, embarassing movie to an audience, who thankfully has access to internet and can look up for the facts.\n\nIt's said that the year is 1442, but the real Vlad the Impaler was 11 years old at that time. And the geography? The location of the buildings don't match up. The costumes, Ottoman swords are completely wrong. And Mehmed II, the future conqueror of Constatinople was also 10 years old at that time, but he magically grew up I guess. When Ottoman characters speak Turkish, it sounds like my French students who've just started learning the language. How cringy is that, like, really, could they at least not find the actors proper dialect coaches so that they could be a bit more convincing while pronouncing these two sentences?\n\nIf they think they can sell trash to the audience and not respect them, long live paid streaming channels. We don't have a dime to pay for a two hour long idiocracy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":184050,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.\n\nAnd one final note. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The first, and main problem, was the story. There were some times when it bared some resemblance to one of the best children's books ever written, up there with Peter Pan and the Hans Christian Anderson Fairy tales, for imagination and complexity. However, I especially disliked the dog meat factory subplot, that's where it got really clumsy and it made the climax feel really cluttered. The songs were also nothing to write home about. They were fun to listen to (especially the Weasel song), but they were definitely forgettable. The direction, by I think Terry Jones(also actor), lacked at times the director's usual silliness and fun. There were some scenes, like the train scene where the action felt a bit rushed. However, there were a number of redeeming qualities to the film. Some scenes, like the introduction to Rat, were beautifully shot, and reminded me of Three Men in a Boat. The sets and scenery are very colourful and pretty and the costumes didn't bother me all that much, admittedly though some of the special effects were so-so. The script was good, very witty at times, with some priceless lines especially with Toad, Badger and St John, while maintaining the book's gentleness and drollness which I liked. The performances were in general excellent especially Nicol Williamson as Badger, who brought a much needed gruffness to the character as well as having a gift for comedy. Steve Coogan was touching as Mole. Eric Idle and Terry Jones were very funny in their roles, Idle is wonderfully sympathetic and jovial while Jones has a ball as the juiciest character. The courtroom scene was hilarious because of Toad's increasingly silly breaking-into- song moments, and was the highlight of the film. John Cleese and Stephen Fry were good(Cleese especially), but their appearances were too brief. Anthony Sher was adequately menacing as Chief Weasel, but like everyone else involved, he has been better. All in all, a likable, colourful and funny but unfortunately at times clumsy film, with a 7/10.

This boisterous, big-hearted animated film is bursting with ideas and colour, stuffed to the brim with - one suspects - pretty much every idea that struck writer-director Jorge Gutierrez's fancy. Indeed, the final film plays very much like the charming but unpolished debut of a filmmaker who can't quite believe he was lucky enough to get the attention of producer Guillermo del Toro, and has no intention of wasting the opportunity in case it never comes around again. As a result, The Book Of Life practically trembles with too many ideas and influences, but remains so earnest and inventive that it's easy to forgive its predictable, overstuffed plot.\n\nIn a small Mexican town on the Day Of The Dead, we meet the protagonists of the story: steadfast, earnest Manolo (voiced by Diego Luna), who would rather strum a guitar than fight a bull in the tradition of his forefathers; brash, adventurous Joaquin (Channing Tatum), who becomes the town hero in trying to avenge the murder of his father by bandits; and spunky, intelligent Maria (Zoe Saldana), daughter of the mayor who inevitably wins the hearts of both young men. The stakes, however, are higher than they could ever imagine: the two godly rulers of the underworld, La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) and Xibalba (Ron Perlman), have gambled dominion over each other's lands on the outcome of the love triangle.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that there's a lot going on in The Book Of Life. The film covers everything from a mystical medal that lends invulnerability to anyone who wears it, to a tantalising love-hate relationship between the two gods, while spiced up with musical interludes galore. (It's not often that the film's hero will pause to belt out a soul-searching rendition of Radiohead's Creep, but that kind of thing happens all the time in The Book Of Life.) Mix it all up with retellings of Mexican folklore, including visits to the joyously colourful Land of the Remembered and the ghostly grey Land of the Forgotten, and the film can be a somewhat frenetic viewing experience, to say the least.\n\nBut, for all that Gutierrez packs his film full of ideas and details, he also manages to make most of it work very well. The love triangle may be trite, but there's nevertheless enough heart and humour holding Manolo, Maria and Joaquin together. Manolo's relationships with his dad Carlos (Hector Elizondo) and his departed mom Carmen (Ana de la Reguera) are coloured in with surprising depth as well. It's also wonderful to see a love triangle centred around a girl who knows her own mind - and rest assured that Maria speaks it often enough to make a real impact.\n\nThe Book Of Life also doubles as a very welcome riot of imagination and tradition. Every frame of the film is beautifully and thoughtfully designed, down to the fact that Manolo seems to have been intricately crafted out of wood. Moreover, instead of shying away from its Mexican roots to increase its global marketability, the film firmly embraces them. This gives Gutierrez room to craft some delicately dark moments in a graveyard or two, reminding everyone that those who have died can still live as long as they're remembered by the ones who loved them. And yet, the film never descends into darkness, instead tapping into the giddying energy of a fiesta - most memorably in a journey through the Land of the Remembered - complete with heady bursts of colour and music.\n\nThere's no denying that Gutierrez's film can occasionally be too much to handle. It's loud and almost cheerfully silly, tossing pop songs and Mexican folklore into a mix that sometimes doesn't work. But, at its best, The Book Of Life is like a rambunctious puppy: messy, loud and insistent, but radiating so much life and charm that it becomes quite impossible to resist.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66162,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The backgrounds have some great detail and it is colourful to look at, so most of the animation is good. The soundtrack is bouncy and has an adventurous feel to it. Freddie Highmore is still likable in the title role while Mia Farrow is as kindly and compassionate as in the first film and Selena Gomez is an improvement over Madonna, actually sounding like a young princess and closer to Highmore's age rather than somebody trying to sound younger. The story is very thinly plotted though and reads a lot like filler, not helped also by very hyperactive pacing and an abrupt conclusion, which felt more like the start of a film than the end. Arthur's adventure and search is tiresome and takes too long to get going, and there is too much of the father character, an important character but not that important.

Maltarzard, one of the first film's stronger characters, is a very weak villain this time round, here a character that is under-utilised and underwritten. Jimmy Fallon is even more irritating here now the material is weaker, Snoop Dogg fares better but also struggles. Will.i.am is out of place, but the worst case was Lou Reed, who sounds really bored and monotone. No attempt whatsoever is made to make Maltarzard sound like he did in Arthur and the Invisibles, and his character design here might leave youngsters who saw this film without seeing the first traumatised.

Now I have never read the book in my life, but I am aware that the film is an extremely loose, contemporary adaptation with a setting in the present day rather than the 1930s in the book. So if you're a die-hard fan of the classic book, avoid this movie because they made so many changes to this new setting, it's insane. I am a Jim Carrey fan as well, which was the main reason I went to this film, but don't kill me for saying that I still have not seen Liar Liar, Ace Ventura, and The Mask yet. But those three are still on my watch list, though.\n\nJim Carrey plays Tom Popper, a successful New York City businessman who has put almost all of his life into his work life instead of family. One day he gets a phone call saying that his father has died, but he left him a gift behind. That gift is six gentoo penguins, and these penguins are going to help him realize that he has shunned out almost every opportunity he's had in life to appreciate the beauty you can experience if you take the time to do so. Once the penguins are brought into the public eye, though, Popper has to contend with a stern zoo keeper (Clark Gregg) who wants the penguins because he believes that Popper's house is not well-suited to take care of all of them.\n\nJim Carrey definitely carries this movie and saves it from being a complete disaster. His physical slapstick that has become well known in almost his whole career translates in a good enough manner to provide so decent moments of comedy. He may be very grounded in his limits for what he can and can't do, but watching Carrey go crazy on screen is always good enough for me. The supporting cast's performances are really nothing special, but it was pretty cool to see Clark Gregg go on the villain side for once, when he's not playing SHIELD Agent Phil Coulson in the MARVEL films building up to The Avengers. However, the penguins I believe are the weakest part of the film. The jokes involving the penguins are heavily centered on young children and parents who like to see their kids laugh. I'm 17 so I thought most of the jokes were very juvenile at some times, especially a running joke they carry on with one of the penguins who goes by the name of Stinky. In addition, you'll be able to tell in every scene involving the penguins when they're real or CGI, especially in the final climactic sequence of the film.\n\nOverall, if you've seen the trailers to this film, you pretty much know what you're going to get out it. This movie could have been a Razzie nominee in several categories, but Jim Carrey is there to save it from going in that direction. I can say that I mildly enjoyed most of this movie, but I'll probably forget sometime this week.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":91751,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2011-06-17","keywords":"the little tramp character,male protagonist,penguin,winter,new york city","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mr. Popper's Penguins: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1332583705","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NTY5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEwMTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4NTY5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEwMTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The life of a businessman begins to change after he inherits six penguins, and as he transforms his apartment into a winter wonderland, his professional side starts to unravel.

I enjoyed the movie. Not great but not bad. One of the most nagging problems with this movie has it was way to short and seemed like it was in fast forward most of the movie. If they would have increased this movie to 2 hours to 2 and a half hours I think it would have been a very good movie (hopefully the DVD will have more added in). The acting by Rachel Weisz was fantastic. Jeremy Irons did a very good for his part. But those are two experienced actors that will give good performances regardless. The CG on Saphira was very well done. The main problem with the acting in this movie was Edward Speleers, he had no presence in this movie, which is a bad thing for the main character. It was all most like he was just there to read his lines and go home. For which I hold the director responsible but it was also one of his first movies. I think Edward would have made a good side character, but someone with more experienced should have been casted as Eragon or a director with more proved talent. If you have never read the book and enjoy good CG you will like this movie. Just change the name of the movie to Saphira and it is OK. If you have read the book assume it is a coincidence that the movie and characters share names.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":123482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I enjoyed the movie. Not great but not bad. One of the most nagging problems with this movie has it was way to short and seemed like it was in fast forward most of the movie. If they would have increased this movie to 2 hours to 2 and a half hours I think it would have been a very good movie (hopefully the DVD will have more added in). The acting by Rachel Weisz was fantastic. Jeremy Irons did a very good for his part. But those are two experienced actors that will give good performances regardless. The CG on Saphira was very well done. The main problem with the acting in this movie was Edward Speleers, he had no presence in this movie, which is a bad thing for the main character. It was all most like he was just there to read his lines and go home. For which I hold the director responsible but it was also one of his first movies. I think Edward would have made a good side character, but someone with more experienced should have been casted as Eragon or a director with more proved talent. If you have never read the book and enjoy good CG you will like this movie. Just change the name of the movie to Saphira and it is OK. If you have read the book assume it is a coincidence that the movie and characters share names.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":123482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Actually, despite a lazy script full of nonstop crude and sex jokes, and moments that could be really awful, this movie is above the very low bar. Jack Black and Michael Cera take this bad material and make something mediocre out of it, which still isn't saying much.\n\nZed (Jack Black) is a gatherer who tries to fit in with the hunter clan, but he's just too silly for their tastes. Oh (Michael Cera) is also a gatherer and is a somewhat unpopular with the ladies. After an accident involving fire, this mismatched pair has to leave and they do through various pieces of biblical history, including meeting Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd), and meeting Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Abraham (Hank Azaria), who apparently had a thing for cutting foreskin. The movie is a hodge podge of scenes thrown together with very little plot, but by the end Zed and Oh have to save the lives of two girls from their village.\n\nJack Black and Michael Cera are pretty good here. Jack Black does his typical over the top stoner performance and Michael Cera gives the emotional boy performance. Even David Cross and Oliver Platt manage to squeeze some laughs out of their performances. But nobody really has a lot of material to work with, though at the same time the material isn't the worst out there. It's bad, and oftentimes relies on some outwardly sexual material. In fact, this is the least subtle PG-13 rated film I've seen where sexual or crude jokes are involved. This includes scenes of eating poop and throwing testicles. If something sexual happens, it's not only just implied, but it's flaunted.\n\nOne big problem is the lack of plot in the movie. It grows boring going from setpiece to setpiece, never establishing a real plot until the end, and despite being only around 100 minutes, it still feels way too long. The climax is ridiculous and quite boring, and this movie is too filled with scenes that aren't particularly horrible, but they aren't particularly funny, and all too often this movie is just a laugh free staring at the screen. It managed to attain quite consistent mediocrity, with some chuckles every once in a while. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't good either, by any means.\n\nMy rating: ** out of ****. 105 mins. PG-13 for crude sexual humor, drug use, and language.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94936,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-08-12","keywords":"horniness,sodom,cain and abel,biblical satire,prehistory","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Year One: Superbowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2134442777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjI0MDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzODkyMg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjI0MDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzODkyMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the Year One commercial which aired during the 2009 Superbowl."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085312/","name":"Jack Black"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1312575/","name":"Olivia Wilde"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035477/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1969144/","name":"Gene Stupnitsky"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1072409/","name":"Lee Eisenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Year One: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Jack Black, Michael Cera, Oliver Platt, David Cross. After being banished from their tribe, two hunter-gatherers encounter Biblical characters and eventually wind up in the city of Sodom." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1045778/","name":"Year One","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMTU3NTI3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzkzMjU2Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After being banished from their tribe, two hunter-gatherers encounter Biblical characters and eventually wind up in the city of Sodom.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1045778/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"TOMNEL","dateCreated":"2009-06-25","inLanguage":"English","name":"There's not very many horribly bad moments, but at the same time, there's very few funny moments.","reviewBody":"From the reviews, this movie seemed like it would be horribly bad, and full of annoying cringe worthy moments, but this is not true at all. Actually, despite a lazy script full of nonstop crude and sex jokes, and moments that could be really awful, this movie is above the very low bar. Jack Black and Michael Cera take this bad material and make something mediocre out of it, which still isn't saying much.\n\nZed (Jack Black) is a gatherer who tries to fit in with the hunter clan, but he's just too silly for their tastes. Oh (Michael Cera) is also a gatherer and is a somewhat unpopular with the ladies. After an accident involving fire, this mismatched pair has to leave and they do through various pieces of biblical history, including meeting Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd), and meeting Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Abraham (Hank Azaria), who apparently had a thing for cutting foreskin. The movie is a hodge podge of scenes thrown together with very little plot, but by the end Zed and Oh have to save the lives of two girls from their village.\n\nJack Black and Michael Cera are pretty good here. Jack Black does his typical over the top stoner performance and Michael Cera gives the emotional boy performance. Even David Cross and Oliver Platt manage to squeeze some laughs out of their performances. But nobody really has a lot of material to work with, though at the same time the material isn't the worst out there. It's bad, and oftentimes relies on some outwardly sexual material. In fact, this is the least subtle PG-13 rated film I've seen where sexual or crude jokes are involved. This includes scenes of eating poop and throwing testicles. If something sexual happens, it's not only just implied, but it's flaunted.\n\nOne big problem is the lack of plot in the movie. It grows boring going from setpiece to setpiece, never establishing a real plot until the end, and despite being only around 100 minutes, it still feels way too long. The climax is ridiculous and quite boring, and this movie is too filled with scenes that aren't particularly horrible, but they aren't particularly funny, and all too often this movie is just a laugh free staring at the screen. It managed to attain quite consistent mediocrity, with some chuckles every once in a while. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't good either, by any means.\n\nMy rating: ** out of ****. 105 mins. PG-13 for crude sexual humor, drug use, and language.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94936,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-08-12","keywords":"horniness,sodom,cain and abel,biblical satire,prehistory","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Year One: Superbowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2134442777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjI0MDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzODkyMg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjI0MDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzODkyMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the Year One commercial which aired during the 2009 Superbowl.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085312/","name":"Jack Black","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1312575/","name":"Olivia Wilde"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035477/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1969144/","name":"Gene Stupnitsky","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1072409/","name":"Lee Eisenberg"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Actually, despite a lazy script full of nonstop crude and sex jokes, and moments that could be really awful, this movie is above the very low bar. Jack Black and Michael Cera take this bad material and make something mediocre out of it, which still isn't saying much.\n\nZed (Jack Black) is a gatherer who tries to fit in with the hunter clan, but he's just too silly for their tastes. Oh (Michael Cera) is also a gatherer and is a somewhat unpopular with the ladies. After an accident involving fire, this mismatched pair has to leave and they do through various pieces of biblical history, including meeting Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd), and meeting Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Abraham (Hank Azaria), who apparently had a thing for cutting foreskin. The movie is a hodge podge of scenes thrown together with very little plot, but by the end Zed and Oh have to save the lives of two girls from their village.\n\nJack Black and Michael Cera are pretty good here. Jack Black does his typical over the top stoner performance and Michael Cera gives the emotional boy performance. Even David Cross and Oliver Platt manage to squeeze some laughs out of their performances. But nobody really has a lot of material to work with, though at the same time the material isn't the worst out there. It's bad, and oftentimes relies on some outwardly sexual material. In fact, this is the least subtle PG-13 rated film I've seen where sexual or crude jokes are involved. This includes scenes of eating poop and throwing testicles. If something sexual happens, it's not only just implied, but it's flaunted.\n\nOne big problem is the lack of plot in the movie. It grows boring going from setpiece to setpiece, never establishing a real plot until the end, and despite being only around 100 minutes, it still feels way too long. The climax is ridiculous and quite boring, and this movie is too filled with scenes that aren't particularly horrible, but they aren't particularly funny, and all too often this movie is just a laugh free staring at the screen. It managed to attain quite consistent mediocrity, with some chuckles every once in a while. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't good either, by any means.\n\nMy rating: ** out of ****. 105 mins. PG-13 for crude sexual humor, drug use, and language.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94936,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-08-12","keywords":"horniness,sodom,cain and abel,biblical satire,prehistory","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Year One: Superbowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2134442777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjI0MDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzODkyMg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjI0MDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzODkyMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the Year One commercial which aired during the 2009 Superbowl."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085312/","name":"Jack Black"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1312575/","name":"Olivia Wilde"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035477/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1969144/","name":"Gene Stupnitsky"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1072409/","name":"Lee Eisenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Actually, despite a lazy script full of nonstop crude and sex jokes, and moments that could be really awful, this movie is above the very low bar. Jack Black and Michael Cera take this bad material and make something mediocre out of it, which still isn't saying much.\n\nZed (Jack Black) is a gatherer who tries to fit in with the hunter clan, but he's just too silly for their tastes. Oh (Michael Cera) is also a gatherer and is a somewhat unpopular with the ladies. After an accident involving fire, this mismatched pair has to leave and they do through various pieces of biblical history, including meeting Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd), and meeting Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Abraham (Hank Azaria), who apparently had a thing for cutting foreskin. The movie is a hodge podge of scenes thrown together with very little plot, but by the end Zed and Oh have to save the lives of two girls from their village.\n\nJack Black and Michael Cera are pretty good here. Jack Black does his typical over the top stoner performance and Michael Cera gives the emotional boy performance. Even David Cross and Oliver Platt manage to squeeze some laughs out of their performances. But nobody really has a lot of material to work with, though at the same time the material isn't the worst out there. It's bad, and oftentimes relies on some outwardly sexual material. In fact, this is the least subtle PG-13 rated film I've seen where sexual or crude jokes are involved. This includes scenes of eating poop and throwing testicles. If something sexual happens, it's not only just implied, but it's flaunted.\n\nOne big problem is the lack of plot in the movie.

Well, I had no problem with it as I think that 'Hausmeiter Krause' is hilarious but I didn't knew how horrible this movie would turn out.\n\nThere are two beer addicts called Tommie and Mario, the latter who plays second fiddle most of the time but I didn't care about him because his acting was forgettable anyway. I paid more attention to Tom Gerhardt. To get a clue what his character is all about he is very similar to the Tommie character in the Hausmeister Krause sitcom but I have to sadly admit that this character fits more to an adolescent than some 40 year unemployed person because it seems unrealistic that someone this old can be so ridiculously stupid and the fact that this is unusual doesn't make it funny either.\n\nThe gags mostly range from slap-stick to one-liners, unfortunately neither both of them are funny most of the time. The movie is so often over the top that many odd scenes occur most of the time. Both of the main characters jump from a beach party to an hotel to the kitchen of a restaurant to an arena etc. etc. with no logical explanation how they've got there at all just to get some cheap childish jokes in.\n\nSo that more people watched the movie when it was in the theatres it has a big list of cameo appearances from German celebrities and actors; I still wonder how some of the more remarkable German actors could whore them out just to appear in this bad movie.\n\nAt last I suggest anyone to skip this movie that contains sheer stupidness and watch the way funnier sitcom Hausmeister Krause."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3113,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1997-10-16","keywords":"german humor,proles,german abroad,car,automobile","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0314305/","name":"Tom Gerhardt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0845609/","name":"Hilmi Sözer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290903/","name":"Diana Frank"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005846/","name":"Gernot Roll"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0314305/","name":"Tom Gerhardt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011349/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037894/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0314305/","name":"Tom Gerhardt"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Well, I had no problem with it as I think that 'Hausmeiter Krause' is hilarious but I didn't knew how horrible this movie would turn out.\n\nThere are two beer addicts called Tommie and Mario, the latter who plays second fiddle most of the time but I didn't care about him because his acting was forgettable anyway. I paid more attention to Tom Gerhardt. To get a clue what his character is all about he is very similar to the Tommie character in the Hausmeister Krause sitcom but I have to sadly admit that this character fits more to an adolescent than some 40 year unemployed person because it seems unrealistic that someone this old can be so ridiculously stupid and the fact that this is unusual doesn't make it funny either.\n\nThe gags mostly range from slap-stick to one-liners, unfortunately neither both of them are funny most of the time. The movie is so often over the top that many odd scenes occur most of the time. Both of the main characters jump from a beach party to an hotel to the kitchen of a restaurant to an arena etc. etc. with no logical explanation how they've got there at all just to get some cheap childish jokes in.\n\nSo that more people watched the movie when it was in the theatres it has a big list of cameo appearances from German celebrities and actors; I still wonder how some of the more remarkable German actors could whore them out just to appear in this bad movie.\n\nAt last I suggest anyone to skip this movie that contains sheer stupidness and watch the way funnier sitcom Hausmeister Krause.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3113,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1997-10-16","keywords":"german humor,proles,german abroad,car,automobile","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0314305/","name":"Tom Gerhardt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0845609/","name":"Hilmi Sözer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290903/","name":"Diana Frank"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005846/","name":"Gernot Roll","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0314305/","name":"Tom Gerhardt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011349/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037894/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0314305/","name":"Tom Gerhardt"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I thought JS's acting was pretty good. Compares favourably to other action stars' attempts over the years. I really enjoyed seeing Kate Bosworth, Winona Ryder and James Franco playing against type. Franco can be a bit hit and miss, he shines in the right roles, but others he struggles with (Annapolis for example). Definitely a hit here, his bad guy had more nuance than was strictly written into the part. Deserves a bit more than the 6.5 it's got as I write this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112292,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is so light, so optimistic, so unabashed and so well done that leaves only good impressions. Usually, the sequels and moreover all other continuations do not work out, but this did it. 91 minutes of the film fly so quickly that at the end you need more of this merry, funny, witty work. All the beloved heroes are here  silly Police Chief with all his crazy ideas, pot-smoking Rasta cop, slightly slow Afro-American cop, and then, the excellent trio of main heroes  Mr. Taxi Driver, Daniel; clumsy and sluggish Emelienne and then his super wife, Petra. This trio holds the whole film well, but then without all the secondary characters it also would be impossible to make this movie so good. The Belgian criminal, slightly stupid gangsters, terribly inept policemen, shoot-outs, chases, fights, drugs, football  everything is mixed up and served so hot, so immediate, so tasty and so refreshingly funny. This is a great example that Part Four sometimes may be very good.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":27270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is so light, so optimistic, so unabashed and so well done that leaves only good impressions. Usually, the sequels and moreover all other continuations do not work out, but this did it. 91 minutes of the film fly so quickly that at the end you need more of this merry, funny, witty work. All the beloved heroes are here  silly Police Chief with all his crazy ideas, pot-smoking Rasta cop, slightly slow Afro-American cop, and then, the excellent trio of main heroes  Mr. Taxi Driver, Daniel; clumsy and sluggish Emelienne and then his super wife, Petra. This trio holds the whole film well, but then without all the secondary characters it also would be impossible to make this movie so good. The Belgian criminal, slightly stupid gangsters, terribly inept policemen, shoot-outs, chases, fights, drugs, football  everything is mixed up and served so hot, so immediate, so tasty and so refreshingly funny. This is a great example that Part Four sometimes may be very good.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":27270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He knew that for his beloved 'Cornetto Trilogy,' he would need an ending that could somehow tie up all of its strains of manic, voracious genre pastiche, savage wit and silliness, and, most importantly, its symphony to the reluctant aging of the schlubby, post- Shaun adult male. He knew he needed to do something special.\n\nSo, in the words of Shaun, "what do you mean, DO something?" Well, getting the old gang together for a nostalgia-fuelled 'one last job' pub crawl, charged with more emotional weight and subtext than meets the eye should about do it. In this regard, Cornetto #3 is by far the most personal, mature, reflective, bittersweet and cognizant film in Wright's oeuvre. It knowingly winks at his past works (don't forget to say hi to Brian, Marsha, and Tires, listen for the fruit machine, and enjoy an appropriately sly Cornetto cameo), while introducing some of his most hysterically snappy wordplay yet ("maybe it's a windoor...!"). And, as no Wright film could ever be that straightforward, it's also, naturally, about the end of the world. Duh.\n\nTo some, The World's End will be a cracking sci-fi pastiche - Invasion of the Body Snatchers handled with the chilly British terseness of The Day of the Triffids. To others, it's a riotous, boozy action-comedy with a kickass set of tunes, and prime viewing before hitting the pub (or several) with your mates. All of these things are true. But for me, it will always be a film about growing up. A film about finding closure, and purpose. A film about coming home and moving on at once. A film encouraging the Gary King in all of us to make peace with friends, the past, the future, and ourselves. It's the perfect filmic encapsulation of playing James Bond video games in my adolescent basement. And it's a film about pursuing your dreams, even - nay, especially - if your dreams are pointless, idiotic, and involve a sh*t-ton of drinking.\n\nThings get going at an almost ponderously slow and repetitive pace, forcing the viewer to be bludgeoned by Gary King, alongside his estranged high school buddies, into going on his quest with him. The tone is fun, but with a bit of an edge, Pegg bravely playing obnoxious at full tilt, keeping it unclear as to whether you can or should like him. But, upon arriving in the impossibly quaint Newton Haven (and here Wright coins the most on-the-nose term for cultural assimilation and the dearth of family-run local business: "Starbucking". Remember that theme; it'll come in handy later), things pick up, and then some. Here, King's raucous enthusiasm becomes almost worrisome, especially in contrast with his bemused buddies, all more content to act their ages. Thankfully, the sci-fi framework comes to the rescue right when King is on the cusp of having to be serious. The solution, like fellow extraterrestrial alcoholicomedy Grabbers? Keep drinking - to "blend in", of course. And, as the Doors kick in, that's where the fun really begins.\n\nWright's characteristic swish-pans and dynamic sound effects, paired with some of the most intricately crunchy fight choreography seen in ages make The World's End thrilling in the most visceral sense. There's no purer cinematic joy than a long-take tracking shot of Pegg weaving in and out of a chaotic robot throwdown, stepping on bar stools and counter tops, sipping his pint and throwing the occasional like a tipsy Buster Keaton, and it's impossible not to share in Wright's glee. The robot designs are eerily simple, the pace and physical slapstick are howlingly perfect, while the grim, sepia lighting is perfectly atmospheric for the intensifying sci-fi peril and slurring melodrama unfolding. And the climactic, belligerent belch of a speech demanding agency on behalf of the human race? I dare you to find more galvanizing words.\n\nGary King is a courageously different Simon Pegg than has been unleashed before, and his manic energy, boundless but strained charisma and desperate arrogance make for his most achingly human (but still hilarious) creation yet. Nick Frost also digs into unforeseen dramatic meat, pairing his juggernaut physical comedy with real pain and hard-won regret, all the funnier for being so truthful. There's also a gag involving him (literally) punching a clock which may be the funniest in Wright's oeuvre. Paddy Considine and Martin Freeman collectively ace the two sides of the middle-aged-hipster coin (post-meathead athletic emotional sensitivity and antiquated, bluetoothed tech-speak respectively), while Eddie Marsan finds both huge laughs and the most raw hangdog pathos in the sweetness of Peter Page. Sadly, in the film's only real fault, Edgar's boys club has no proper room for Rosamund Pike, and it's a real shame, as she's on typically superb form, and amiably hilarious to boot. As this instalment's former-007-turned- villain-with-uncomfortable-facial-hair, Pierce Brosnan tweaks his debonair charm and silky Irish accent to their most calmly sinister, while the inevitable Bill Nighy is deliciously bemused as a big lamp who just won't f*ck off back to Legoland.\n\nThe World's End (or, as everyone should henceforth refer to it, 'Smashy-Smashy-Egg-Men'), is not only a stupendously satisfying Cornetto resolution. It's perfectly paced, technically flawless, thrilling, hugely fun, and bravely emotional romp. It's arguably the funniest and most real mediation on friends, homecomings, and befuddled male aging to date. It's a belligerently, obstinately, chaotically, damn good film. It's something truly special. So hop into the Beast, blare those Soup Dragons, and ride Wright's beautiful disaster all the way to the bitter end. Or lager end. Because, be honest: what could be a more heartfelt answer to Primal Scream's recurring query - "Just what is it that you want to do?"\n\n-10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268907,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-07-19","keywords":"paranoia,twin actresses for twin sisters,doppelganger,group therapy,alcoholic","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2087953945","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjMxODMwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3NzY1OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjMxODMwM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3NzY1OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Five friends who reunite in an attempt to top their epic pub crawl from 20 years earlier unwittingly become humankind's only hope for survival.

He knew that for his beloved 'Cornetto Trilogy,' he would need an ending that could somehow tie up all of its strains of manic, voracious genre pastiche, savage wit and silliness, and, most importantly, its symphony to the reluctant aging of the schlubby, post- Shaun adult male. He knew he needed to do something special.\n\nSo, in the words of Shaun, "what do you mean, DO something?" Well, getting the old gang together for a nostalgia-fuelled 'one last job' pub crawl, charged with more emotional weight and subtext than meets the eye should about do it. In this regard, Cornetto #3 is by far the most personal, mature, reflective, bittersweet and cognizant film in Wright's oeuvre. It knowingly winks at his past works (don't forget to say hi to Brian, Marsha, and Tires, listen for the fruit machine, and enjoy an appropriately sly Cornetto cameo), while introducing some of his most hysterically snappy wordplay yet ("maybe it's a windoor...!"). And, as no Wright film could ever be that straightforward, it's also, naturally, about the end of the world. Duh.\n\nTo some, The World's End will be a cracking sci-fi pastiche - Invasion of the Body Snatchers handled with the chilly British terseness of The Day of the Triffids. To others, it's a riotous, boozy action-comedy with a kickass set of tunes, and prime viewing before hitting the pub (or several) with your mates. All of these things are true. But for me, it will always be a film about growing up. A film about finding closure, and purpose. A film about coming home and moving on at once. A film encouraging the Gary King in all of us to make peace with friends, the past, the future, and ourselves. It's the perfect filmic encapsulation of playing James Bond video games in my adolescent basement. And it's a film about pursuing your dreams, even - nay, especially - if your dreams are pointless, idiotic, and involve a sh*t-ton of drinking.\n\nThings get going at an almost ponderously slow and repetitive pace, forcing the viewer to be bludgeoned by Gary King, alongside his estranged high school buddies, into going on his quest with him. The tone is fun, but with a bit of an edge, Pegg bravely playing obnoxious at full tilt, keeping it unclear as to whether you can or should like him. But, upon arriving in the impossibly quaint Newton Haven (and here Wright coins the most on-the-nose term for cultural assimilation and the dearth of family-run local business: "Starbucking". Remember that theme; it'll come in handy later), things pick up, and then some. Here, King's raucous enthusiasm becomes almost worrisome, especially in contrast with his bemused buddies, all more content to act their ages. Thankfully, the sci-fi framework comes to the rescue right when King is on the cusp of having to be serious. The solution, like fellow extraterrestrial alcoholicomedy Grabbers? Keep drinking - to "blend in", of course. And, as the Doors kick in, that's where the fun really begins.\n\nWright's characteristic swish-pans and dynamic sound effects, paired with some of the most intricately crunchy fight choreography seen in ages make The World's End thrilling in the most visceral sense. There's no purer cinematic joy than a long-take tracking shot of Pegg weaving in and out of a chaotic robot throwdown, stepping on bar stools and counter tops, sipping his pint and throwing the occasional like a tipsy Buster Keaton, and it's impossible not to share in Wright's glee. The robot designs are eerily simple, the pace and physical slapstick are howlingly perfect, while the grim, sepia lighting is perfectly atmospheric for the intensifying sci-fi peril and slurring melodrama unfolding. And the climactic, belligerent belch of a speech demanding agency on behalf of the human race? I dare you to find more galvanizing words.\n\nGary King is a courageously different Simon Pegg than has been unleashed before, and his manic energy, boundless but strained charisma and desperate arrogance make for his most achingly human (but still hilarious) creation yet. Nick Frost also digs into unforeseen dramatic meat, pairing his juggernaut physical comedy with real pain and hard-won regret, all the funnier for being so truthful.
