The common link between CM &amp; CSI is that the question of "How?" is always more interesting.\n\nThe only difference: CSI centers around physical evidence gathering &amp; collecting the pieces to solve a puzzle.\n\nCriminal Minds involves more psychology &amp; sociology. We, as viewers, want to know what makes someone tick as a way to prevent crimes from occurring again.\n\nAnother reason why I enjoy this showed so much is how the characters put their expertise in play to solve some of the most twisted people around.\n\nAs casting is concerned: Patinkin is perfect as Jason Gideon. If you think about it, he's more like a professor citing famous lines from Einstein, Faulkner, etc.\n\nWhen I first read those lines, it didn't make sense at first, but as you watch each episode , the lines that Gideon cites has more meaning to it.\n\nFor example: Einstein: "Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world." Gideon is saying that the human mind is the deadliest weapon of all, &amp; we are capable of anything &amp; everything of achieving all kinds of possibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Criminal Minds is the kind the of show that anyone can enjoy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":167962,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There are echoes of almost all the Hannibal Lecter movies. Abbie Cornish's FBI agent never escapes from the shadow of Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling. Colin Farrell is, as ever, a charismatic presence, although he is playing a character the script does not make remotely believable. We see too many of Hopkins's 'visions' of how things may (or may not) be about to turn out. Nowhere near as grim and atmospheric as SE7EN, SOLACE is more than a little daft - but despite muddled direction it's still gripping and at least as watchable as a 'vintage' episode of CSI.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":58299,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Anthony Hopkins, in creepy (hammy!) near-Hannibal mode, plays a clairvoyant investigator helping the FBI track down a serial killer who - by credibility-stretching coincidence - also happens to be blessed with amazing psychic powers and has a seriously weird motive for his grisly crimes.\n\nSOLACE was originally pitched as a sequel to SE7EN, we're told, and had major production difficulties. There are echoes of almost all the Hannibal Lecter movies. Abbie Cornish's FBI agent never escapes from the shadow of Jodie Foster's Clarice Starling. Colin Farrell is, as ever, a charismatic presence, although he is playing a character the script does not make remotely believable. We see too many of Hopkins's 'visions' of how things may (or may not) be about to turn out. Nowhere near as grim and atmospheric as SE7EN, SOLACE is more than a little daft - but despite muddled direction it's still gripping and at least as watchable as a 'vintage' episode of CSI.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":58299,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The common link between CM &amp; CSI is that the question of "How?" is always more interesting.\n\nThe only difference: CSI centers around physical evidence gathering &amp; collecting the pieces to solve a puzzle.\n\nCriminal Minds involves more psychology &amp; sociology. We, as viewers, want to know what makes someone tick as a way to prevent crimes from occurring again.\n\nAnother reason why I enjoy this showed so much is how the characters put their expertise in play to solve some of the most twisted people around.\n\nAs casting is concerned: Patinkin is perfect as Jason Gideon. If you think about it, he's more like a professor citing famous lines from Einstein, Faulkner, etc.\n\nWhen I first read those lines, it didn't make sense at first, but as you watch each episode , the lines that Gideon cites has more meaning to it.\n\nFor example: Einstein: "Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world." Gideon is saying that the human mind is the deadliest weapon of all, &amp; we are capable of anything &amp; everything of achieving all kinds of possibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Criminal Minds is the kind the of show that anyone can enjoy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":167962,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Within ten minutes we were hooked the cast is so well assembled we especially love Dr Spencer Reid, He is comes a cross like a real nervous geek, In his own words he looks like a teaching assistant. I think the stories are very well thought out, and the acting is super. I never thought I could take Thomas Gibson as a serious actor after Darma and Greg. But I think he is so good in this, You can almost hear his brain ticking over as he mulls over any given situation. As for the rest they all gel so well together. This programme will raise the tension so high within the first ten minutes and will leave you hanging of the edge of the edge of your seat until the last very moment. It's amazing. This programme has definitely made it into my must watch TV schedule along with the CSI franchise Cold Case and Law and Order SVU.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":173625,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

The movie is a slow burn which devotes the majority of its time to establishing the central 3 characters (impressive performances), who make up 3 generations of women from an old family in an old house in rural Victoria. If you enjoy thoughtful film-making with a "less is more" approach, you'll be rewarded by a masterfully disturbing and shocking third act climax with an emotional kick that will give you closure but leave you thinking. It should be noted though, just the like characters in Relic, you'll have to give attention to the people in front of you to reap the rewards.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie is a slow burn which devotes the majority of its time to establishing the central 3 characters (impressive performances), who make up 3 generations of women from an old family in an old house in rural Victoria. If you enjoy thoughtful film-making with a "less is more" approach, you'll be rewarded by a masterfully disturbing and shocking third act climax with an emotional kick that will give you closure but leave you thinking. It should be noted though, just the like characters in Relic, you'll have to give attention to the people in front of you to reap the rewards.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

She's got a certain spontaneity that is refreshing and that remind me of another Audrey [Hepburn].\n\nOut of 100, I gave it 71.

In fact, without Audrey Tautou, it would be pretty boring. Michèle (Tautou) falls for this guy, François (Baer), but also for his religion: Judaism. You see, Michèle is seeking herself in religion. She's been shopping around: Catholicism, Buddhism, etc. There is some tiny bit of thinking on what is it exactly to be a believer, but the movie doesn't go far enough.\n\nBut again, watch it for Tautou. She's got a certain spontaneity that is refreshing and that remind me of another Audrey [Hepburn].\n\nOut of 100, I gave it 71. That's good for ** out of ****.\n\nSeen at home, in Toronto, on November 6th, 2004.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2434,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-09-26","keywords":"anti semitism,jewish,veterinarian,judaism,reference to the old testament","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046347/","name":"Edouard Baer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0220017/","name":"Julie Depardieu"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0047645/","name":"Pascale Bailly"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032072/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0850942/","name":"Alain Tasma","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0047645/","name":"Pascale Bailly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738925/","name":"Marcia Romano"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Perhaps so,but only partially : the part taking place during the occupation is ,in spite of numerous implausibilities, by far the best .\n\nThe modern Marguerite hints at "la grande vadrouille" and the occupied France is as accurate and as plausible as Gérard Oury's world. The exodus , when the French were running away from the German armies took place two years before (and not in 1942);Hemingway was not in France at the time ,he fought in Spain and came back at the end of WW2.\n\nBut if you forget history ,this half is pleasant enough: it's like a fairytale ,after all , as the trick of the trunk shows :so why wouldn't Marguerite help Ernest Hemingway work on "the old man and the sea"? As the resistant fighters networks were top secret , talking about them in a loud voice in a café is comic indeed. The escape from the detention camp takes the biscuit : dad is discouraged , waiting,waiting , but girlie comes to cheer him up ,and voilà! A plane pursued by an officer whose shots are in vain (an escape which recalls "la grande vadrouille")\n\nOn the other hand, the part in modern times is ponderous and even crude (the burps competition) : with the bland long-haired boy ,who seems himself an anachronism (he looks like a seventies kid), it's really derivative (the girl whose father has left home and is replaced by a surly stepdad ) .Only the meeting with the old lady (played by Genevieve Casile ,essentially a stage actress who performed all the classics) ,a trick used often before (Ellen Burstyn in "interstellar",Teresa Wright in "somewhere in time" ) , makes up for the paucity of this half-screenplay.\n\nHalf a pleasant movie ,you make it on the percentages ,but lose out on the bonuses : but on a rainy day,it's always useful.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Comedy","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2020-07-15","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi335724057","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ1YWJmMzYtNjdkYy00MjU5LWJkYTYtOTc3ODI2YWIxZWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ1YWJmMzYtNjdkYy00MjU5LWJkYTYtOTc3ODI2YWIxZWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9061508/","name":"Lila Gueneau Lefas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1745743/","name":"Alice Pol"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180404/","name":"Clovis Cornillac"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1764568/","name":"Pierre Coré"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0163472/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0372268/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022869/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11197468/","name":"Vincent Cuvellier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11197469/","name":"Benoît Robin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0443592/","name":"Stéphane Kazandjian"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Perhaps so,but only partially : the part taking place during the occupation is ,in spite of numerous implausibilities, by far the best .\n\nThe modern Marguerite hints at "la grande vadrouille" and the occupied France is as accurate and as plausible as Gérard Oury's world. The exodus , when the French were running away from the German armies took place two years before (and not in 1942);Hemingway was not in France at the time ,he fought in Spain and came back at the end of WW2.\n\nBut if you forget history ,this half is pleasant enough: it's like a fairytale ,after all , as the trick of the trunk shows :so why wouldn't Marguerite help Ernest Hemingway work on "the old man and the sea"? As the resistant fighters networks were top secret , talking about them in a loud voice in a café is comic indeed. The escape from the detention camp takes the biscuit : dad is discouraged , waiting,waiting , but girlie comes to cheer him up ,and voilà! A plane pursued by an officer whose shots are in vain (an escape which recalls "la grande vadrouille")\n\nOn the other hand, the part in modern times is ponderous and even crude (the burps competition) : with the bland long-haired boy ,who seems himself an anachronism (he looks like a seventies kid), it's really derivative (the girl whose father has left home and is replaced by a surly stepdad ) .Only the meeting with the old lady (played by Genevieve Casile ,essentially a stage actress who performed all the classics) ,a trick used often before (Ellen Burstyn in "interstellar",Teresa Wright in "somewhere in time" ) , makes up for the paucity of this half-screenplay.\n\nHalf a pleasant movie ,you make it on the percentages ,but lose out on the bonuses : but on a rainy day,it's always useful.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Comedy","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2020-07-15","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi335724057","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ1YWJmMzYtNjdkYy00MjU5LWJkYTYtOTc3ODI2YWIxZWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmQ1YWJmMzYtNjdkYy00MjU5LWJkYTYtOTc3ODI2YWIxZWI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9061508/","name":"Lila Gueneau Lefas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1745743/","name":"Alice Pol","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180404/","name":"Clovis Cornillac"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1764568/","name":"Pierre Coré"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0163472/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0372268/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022869/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11197468/","name":"Vincent Cuvellier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11197469/","name":"Benoît Robin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0443592/","name":"Stéphane Kazandjian"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It tackles many sensitive subjects such as depression and suicide but still manages to make you laugh raucously the whole way through.

It tackles many sensitive subjects such as depression and suicide but still manages to make you laugh raucously the whole way through.

It was perhaps the glorious age for TV comedians who could count on their fame to earn ticket passes for the big screen, and while Alain Chabat's "Asterix and Cleopatra" was an exception because it was based on a classic comic-book, two movies released in 2004 proved, if it ever needed to be proved, that you can have all the stars your producers' wallet can attract, without a story, you have nothing.\n\nIt all started with the dreadful "RRRrrrr!!!", a film set in prehistoric times and whose only reason to exist was to give to TV surrealist comedic troop "Robin des Bois" (a French poor man's "Monty Python") a chance to grace the silver screen for the first time. Closer to a disgrace, it was also the last time they did a film together and only Jean-Paul Rouve grew a honorable career out of it, one he could owe to better choices and to his versatility. Chabat lost his Midas touch with "RRRrrrr!!!" but even the critical panning the film met didn't shake this craze over comic-books. The year would see the release of "Iznogoud" and "The Daltons", both based on René Goscinny's iconic characters, and both starring TV stars: Michaël Youn for the former and the 'Eric and Ramzy' duo for the latter.\n\nAnd both have in common that they would make Goscinny roll over his grave or die of a heart stroke if he was still alive, as the stories are just excuses for actors to play their usual shtick under the fallacious homage pretext. We're supposed to laugh when Youn gets excited as when Ramzy acts stupid in "The Daltons" and makes Joe angry, that's it. It's like sitcom humor elevated to the status of cinematic art form, with the complicity of greedy producers who know how to disguise mediocrity under high production values. Because unfortunately, what these films have in common is that they look good and professional enough to fool the viewers, but that's the only luxury they couldn't not afford.\n\nSo, "The Daltons" is about one of the most iconic creations of the late Goscinny and Morris, the four brothers whose escalating heights and contrasting personalities between the small short-tempered leader Joe and the tall but lovably stupid Averell contributed to some of the best pages of Lucky Luke and French-Belgian comic-books. If that relationship worked in the film, you had your film, and why shouldn't it have worked? Eric and Ramzy have proved themselves capable to play duos with contrasting personalities, Eric is talented enough to play the angry one, and Ramzy to be stupid, and I'm sure they grew up reading Lucky Luke like I did. But making a character likable isn't as easy as it sounds, and that was Goscinny's strongest suit, making villainous or stupid characters irresistibly funny.\n\nIndeed, while Averell in the book is stupid, it's an endearing form of stupidity, we're supposed to laugh because it makes Joe angry, the problem in the film is that Averell is so stupid and oblivious to his own stupidity that it makes us angry. I lost patience so many times I couldn't wait for Joe to smack his face, and throws himself in a ravine after that. It's one thing not to stand characters but not when you have to deal with them every time. There's not one ounce of likability in the four of them, one is an autistic imbecile, another one is a sociopathic maniac, and the two others are such worthless plot-fillers they even got the names wrong, Jack was supposed to be William and vice-versa. So, I'm not even sure anyone involved in the writing really took time to read Lucky Luke.\n\nWell I did read the books and being a fan, when the film started, I really gave it the benefit of the doubt, making bandits comical isn't the most difficult task to achieve, there have been comical hold-ups in the history of cinema and hilariously stupid guys, so the film couldn't really miss its target. I could close my eyes on the random addition of Ma Dalton (voiced by Marthe Villalonga, the typecast Jewish-mother of French cinema) but I knew it was going downhill when my ears caught these two words: magical hat. In the obligatory random cameo-moment, the Daltons' cellmate played by Kad Merad reveals the existence of a hat that turns you into a bullet-proof human even if Lucky Luke is the shooter. Lucky Luke's adventures never indulged to Fantasy or Sci-fi so it's not good when the script relies on such desperate tricks.\n\nThere were countless possibilities to make the movie work, hell, there was a simple one: just adapt one of the twenty stories featuring the Daltons, Goscinny's humor can't fail. No they had to come up with a lousy magical hat. I wish it was big enough so they could all hide under it, a pitiful excuse to use CGI, while it only worked for the shadows' gags of Lucky Luke, it was totally overplayed with the hat. And you know there's something wrong when Lucky Luke, played by a convincing Till Schweiger, is the funniest character in the film. Eric and Ramzy suffer from the same syndrome as the Robin des Bois, their appeal is limited to sketch or sitcom format, one movie wouldn't be strong enough to sustain their comical 'talent'.\n\nAnd I remember "The Daltons" was the first movie I reviewed in a post after I had registered on IMDb, I did it in French because the film had infuriated me so much I felt the need to vent my anger in my mother-tongue. I'm not so surprised the post is still there 12 years after, it's not like people have been watching it ever since. Good, such an atrocity didn't deserve to become a classic.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3407,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.3},"genre":["Comedy","Western"],"datePublished":"2004-12-08","keywords":"19th century,street shootout,cowboy,based on comic book,based on graphic novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1964883481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNhOTE3MmYtYWIzNS00N2Y1LWFhNTAtYjdlM2VlYjA2NTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNhOTE3MmYtYWIzNS00N2Y1LWFhNTAtYjdlM2VlYjA2NTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431956/","name":"Eric Judor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0066080/","name":"Ramzy Bedia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785647/","name":"Saïd Serrari"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0372072/","name":"Philippe Haïm"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051581/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080776/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0066080/","name":"Ramzy Bedia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0371890/","name":"Michel Hazanavicius"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431956/","name":"Eric Judor"}],"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was perhaps the glorious age for TV comedians who could count on their fame to earn ticket passes for the big screen, and while Alain Chabat's "Asterix and Cleopatra" was an exception because it was based on a classic comic-book, two movies released in 2004 proved, if it ever needed to be proved, that you can have all the stars your producers' wallet can attract, without a story, you have nothing.\n\nIt all started with the dreadful "RRRrrrr!!!", a film set in prehistoric times and whose only reason to exist was to give to TV surrealist comedic troop "Robin des Bois" (a French poor man's "Monty Python") a chance to grace the silver screen for the first time. Closer to a disgrace, it was also the last time they did a film together and only Jean-Paul Rouve grew a honorable career out of it, one he could owe to better choices and to his versatility. Chabat lost his Midas touch with "RRRrrrr!!!" but even the critical panning the film met didn't shake this craze over comic-books. The year would see the release of "Iznogoud" and "The Daltons", both based on René Goscinny's iconic characters, and both starring TV stars: Michaël Youn for the former and the 'Eric and Ramzy' duo for the latter.\n\nAnd both have in common that they would make Goscinny roll over his grave or die of a heart stroke if he was still alive, as the stories are just excuses for actors to play their usual shtick under the fallacious homage pretext. We're supposed to laugh when Youn gets excited as when Ramzy acts stupid in "The Daltons" and makes Joe angry, that's it. It's like sitcom humor elevated to the status of cinematic art form, with the complicity of greedy producers who know how to disguise mediocrity under high production values. Because unfortunately, what these films have in common is that they look good and professional enough to fool the viewers, but that's the only luxury they couldn't not afford.\n\nSo, "The Daltons" is about one of the most iconic creations of the late Goscinny and Morris, the four brothers whose escalating heights and contrasting personalities between the small short-tempered leader Joe and the tall but lovably stupid Averell contributed to some of the best pages of Lucky Luke and French-Belgian comic-books. If that relationship worked in the film, you had your film, and why shouldn't it have worked? Eric and Ramzy have proved themselves capable to play duos with contrasting personalities, Eric is talented enough to play the angry one, and Ramzy to be stupid, and I'm sure they grew up reading Lucky Luke like I did. But making a character likable isn't as easy as it sounds, and that was Goscinny's strongest suit, making villainous or stupid characters irresistibly funny.\n\nIndeed, while Averell in the book is stupid, it's an endearing form of stupidity, we're supposed to laugh because it makes Joe angry, the problem in the film is that Averell is so stupid and oblivious to his own stupidity that it makes us angry. I lost patience so many times I couldn't wait for Joe to smack his face, and throws himself in a ravine after that. It's one thing not to stand characters but not when you have to deal with them every time. There's not one ounce of likability in the four of them, one is an autistic imbecile, another one is a sociopathic maniac, and the two others are such worthless plot-fillers they even got the names wrong, Jack was supposed to be William and vice-versa. So, I'm not even sure anyone involved in the writing really took time to read Lucky Luke.\n\nWell I did read the books and being a fan, when the film started, I really gave it the benefit of the doubt, making bandits comical isn't the most difficult task to achieve, there have been comical hold-ups in the history of cinema and hilariously stupid guys, so the film couldn't really miss its target. I could close my eyes on the random addition of Ma Dalton (voiced by Marthe Villalonga, the typecast Jewish-mother of French cinema) but I knew it was going downhill when my ears caught these two words: magical hat. In the obligatory random cameo-moment, the Daltons' cellmate played by Kad Merad reveals the existence of a hat that turns you into a bullet-proof human even if Lucky Luke is the shooter. Lucky Luke's adventures never indulged to Fantasy or Sci-fi so it's not good when the script relies on such desperate tricks.\n\nThere were countless possibilities to make the movie work, hell, there was a simple one: just adapt one of the twenty stories featuring the Daltons, Goscinny's humor can't fail. No they had to come up with a lousy magical hat. I wish it was big enough so they could all hide under it, a pitiful excuse to use CGI, while it only worked for the shadows' gags of Lucky Luke, it was totally overplayed with the hat. And you know there's something wrong when Lucky Luke, played by a convincing Till Schweiger, is the funniest character in the film. Eric and Ramzy suffer from the same syndrome as the Robin des Bois, their appeal is limited to sketch or sitcom format, one movie wouldn't be strong enough to sustain their comical 'talent'.\n\nAnd I remember "The Daltons" was the first movie I reviewed in a post after I had registered on IMDb, I did it in French because the film had infuriated me so much I felt the need to vent my anger in my mother-tongue. I'm not so surprised the post is still there 12 years after, it's not like people have been watching it ever since. Good, such an atrocity didn't deserve to become a classic.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3407,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.3,"genre":["Comedy","Western"],"datePublished":"2004-12-08","keywords":"19th century,street shootout,cowboy,based on comic book,based on graphic novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1964883481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNhOTE3MmYtYWIzNS00N2Y1LWFhNTAtYjdlM2VlYjA2NTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNhOTE3MmYtYWIzNS00N2Y1LWFhNTAtYjdlM2VlYjA2NTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431956/","name":"Eric Judor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0066080/","name":"Ramzy Bedia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785647/","name":"Saïd Serrari"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0372072/","name":"Philippe Haïm"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051581/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080776/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0066080/","name":"Ramzy Bedia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0371890/","name":"Michel Hazanavicius","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431956/","name":"Eric Judor"],"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is a very moving and powerful movie that shows the power of loss and love. All the main characters are seriously flawed and damaged people that because they come together (thanks to the angry Tyler) become better people and find their own reasons to truly live life (something none of them have done in years).\n\nI thought the acting was very well done. Some i have heard complain about certain scenes but truthfully, if you have ever suffered any of the losses or pains that these people have, they would realize that the actions are spot on! \n\nI am wowed by the movie, stunned truly... I am also very glad that this movie was made, not as eye candy for Pattinson but rather to show his and others talent on such a touching, difficult, and painful subject. This would not have been made if it were not for the talent in this movie that pushed for it to be made, THANK YOU!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It gives good insight in the daily problems that young Africans like Bandian face and the culture they grow up in. I myself think it's horrible to see that his parents, with the help of some medicine man, decide what Bandian should do and shouldn't do with his life. But it's also a film of joy and hope.

It gives good insight in the daily problems that young Africans like Bandian face and the culture they grow up in. I myself think it's horrible to see that his parents, with the help of some medicine man, decide what Bandian should do and shouldn't do with his life. But it's also a film of joy and hope. Bandian meets new friends on the way and learns about trust and forgiveness. The film paints great pictures of the African landscape.

I want to start off with the Pilot. When I first saw it, I had a lot of problems with it. It was messy, and some of the characters were dumb, and some of the acting was corny.

It was always moving, it wasn't your typical slow-paced suspense show. \n\nIn fact, that pretty much sums up the whole season. This is a crackling, fast-paced and entertaining horror series. I would never call this high- art, but that's what makes it great. The show doesn't take itself seriously at all, and it always remains fun, even when it's silly, and yet you get really invested in the story lines and characters. Sure, the performances are flawed at times, and the writing and directing awkward, but the fast pace in every episode doesn't ever let the viewer gasp for air. This is the true definition of a thrill ride. It also feels very experimental. It executes a lot of things in very unordinary ways, in ways that no other TV show does. It doesn't always succeed, but even when it doesn't, you can appreciate it. \n\nYour friends might call The Walking Dead the better horror show, but I disagree. As far as Pilots go, no matter how entertaining or thrilling American Horror Story's Pilot was, the Pilot for The Walking Dead was better, masterful in every way. Since then, it's merely a good, sometimes great, TV show. It takes itself more seriously and is slower-paced, but it's problem is that a lot of times the writing just feels stale, recycled. You are intrigued by it, but it sometimes feels weaker than it should be. And the fact that it takes itself too seriously sort of dampens the fun one should be having with it, simply because its writing isn't strong enough to stretch out its story lines (like the two best TV shows on air, Mad Men and Breaking Bad, do). American Horror Story is better for these reasons- each episode by itself is exciting, it's always moving, and instead of trying to slow things down and makes its flaws more apparent, it even overdoes things on purpose. Messy, sure, silly, sometimes, but overall more intriguing, funner, and more exciting. I cannot wait for the second season of this, since I thought the resolution to the story of the first season was excellent, as well as the final shot. \n\nP.S. Oh, I also want to add another note to take. The performances do hit their great marks, but the only truly incredible performance is Jessica Lange. Her character and performance makes all other supporting turns in television look stale by comparison, and all of her scenes are truly gold! She needs to win that Emmy next year!

In fact other than Vengeance Valley, the only other film where he played a totally upright hero is Gunfight at the OK Corral.\n\nHe's the orphan kid that gets taken in by rancher Ray Collins who grows up and becomes foreman and companion to Robert Walker, Collins's real son. Walker is a spoiled kid and Lancaster is constantly cleaning up after him. Some of the same plot elements were used later in Man From Laramie and The Big Country. \n\nWalker is both coming home to his wife,Joanne Dru and another girl he's fathered a kid with, Sally Forrest. Lancaster is caught taking hush money over to Forrest by her no-account brothers, John Ireland and Hugh O'Brian. They come to the conclusion that Lancaster has done the deed. That's where the action starts.\n\nGood western with some adult themes. Cattle drive scenes are tough and gritty, they don't have the epic quality of Red River, but are nicely done. The players all give a good account of themselves.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2070,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H23M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In fact other than Vengeance Valley, the only other film where he played a totally upright hero is Gunfight at the OK Corral.\n\nHe's the orphan kid that gets taken in by rancher Ray Collins who grows up and becomes foreman and companion to Robert Walker, Collins's real son. Walker is a spoiled kid and Lancaster is constantly cleaning up after him. Some of the same plot elements were used later in Man From Laramie and The Big Country. \n\nWalker is both coming home to his wife,Joanne Dru and another girl he's fathered a kid with, Sally Forrest. Lancaster is caught taking hush money over to Forrest by her no-account brothers, John Ireland and Hugh O'Brian. They come to the conclusion that Lancaster has done the deed. That's where the action starts.\n\nGood western with some adult themes. Cattle drive scenes are tough and gritty, they don't have the epic quality of Red River, but are nicely done. The players all give a good account of themselves.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2070,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I had heard of Yasujiro Ozu's "Tokyo Story" for several years but never had an opportunity to see it until Criterion resuscitated it as part of their DVD collection. Over fifty years old, this wondrous 1953 film resonates just as deeply today. Those outside Japan rarely get to see a Japanese film classic that doesn't involve samurai warriors in medieval battles. This one, however, is a subtly observed family drama set in post-WWII Japan, and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of Ozu's film-making style that makes this among the most moving of films.\n\nThe plot centers on Shukishi and Tomi, an elderly couple, who traverse the country from their southern fishing village of Onomichi to visit their adult children, daughter Shige and son Koichi, in Tokyo. Leading their own busy lives, the children realize their obligation to entertain them and pack them off to Atami, a nearby resort targeted to weekend revelers. Returning to Tokyo unexpectedly, Tomi visits their kindly daughter-in-law, Noriko, the widow of second son Shoji, while Shukishi gets drunk with some old companions. The old couple realizes they have become a burden to their children and decide to return to Onomichi. They also have a younger daughter Kyoko, a schoolteacher who lives with them, and younger son Keizo works for the train company in Osaka. By now the children, except for Kyoko and the dutiful Noriko, have given up on their parents, even when Tomi takes ill in Osaka on the way back home. From this seemingly convoluted, trivial-sounding storyline, fraught with soap opera possibilities, Ozu has fashioned a heartfelt and ultimately ironic film that focuses on the details in people's lives rather than a single dramatic situation.\n\nWhat fascinates me about Ozu's idiosyncratic style is how he relies on insinuation to carry his story forward. In fact, some of the more critical events happen off-camera because Ozu's simple, penetrating observations of these characters' lives remain powerfully insightful without being contrived. Ozu scholar David Desser, who provides insightful commentary on the alternate audio track, explains this concept as "narrative ellipses", Ozu's singularly effective means of providing emotional continuity to a story without providing all the predictable detail in between. Ozu also positions his camera low throughout his film to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. It adds significantly to the humanity he evokes. There are no melodramatic confrontations among the characters, no masochistic showboating, and the dialogue is deceptively casual, as even the most off-hand remark bears weight into the story. The film condemns no one and its sense of inevitability carries with it only certain resigned sadness. What amazes me most is how the ending is so cathartic because the characters feel so real to me, not because there are manipulative plot developments, even death, which force me to feel for them.\n\nI just love the performances, as they have a neo-realism that makes them all the more affecting. Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama are wonderfully authentic as Shukishi and Tomi, perfectly conveying the resignation they feel about their lives and their children without slipping into cheap sentimentality. Higashiyama effortlessly displays the sunny demeanor of a grandmother, so when sadness does take over in her life, it becomes all the more haunting. In particular, she has a beautiful scene where Tomi looks forlornly at her grandchild wondering what he will be when he grows up and whether she will live to see what happens. Even more heartbreaking is the scene where Shukishi and Tomi sit in Ueno Park realizing their children have no time for them and are resigned to the fact that they need to find a place to sleep for the night. The closest the film has to a villain is Shige, portrayed fearlessly by Haruko Sugimura, who is able to show respect, pettiness and conniving in a realistically mercurial fashion. Watch her as she complains about the expensive cakes her husband bought for her parents (as she selfishly eats them herself) or how she finagles Koichi to co-finance the trip to Atami or how she shows her frustration when her parents come home early from the spa. So Yamamura (familiar to later Western audiences as Admiral Yamamoto in "Tora! Tora! Tora!") displays the right amount of indifference as Koichi, and Kyoko Kagawa has a few sharp lines toward the end of the film as the disappointed Kyoko.\n\nBut the best performance comes from the legendary Setsuko Hara, a luminous actress whose beauty and sensitivity remind me of Olivia de Havilland during the same era. As Noriko, she is breathtaking in showing her character's modesty, her unforced generosity in spite of her downscale status and her constant smile as a mask for her pain. She has a number of deeply affecting moments, for instance, when Noriko explains to Shukishi and Tomi how she misses her husband, even though it is implied he was a brutalizing alcoholic; or the touching goodbye to Kyoko; or her pained embarrassment over the high esteem that Shukishi holds for her kindness. Don't expect fireworks or any shocking moments, just a powerfully emotional film in spite of its seemingly modest approach. The two-disc DVD set has the commentary from Desser on the first disc, as well as the trailer. On the second disc, there are two excellent documentaries. One is a comprehensive 1983, two-hour feature focused on Ozu's life and career, and the second is a 40-minute tribute from several international movie directors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57009,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1953-11-03","keywords":"estrangement,family reunion,post world war two,japanese,generation gap","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2320022553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNGEwMTctYjgwZC00ZTMyLTk4MTMtNjA5MjQwNWMxMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNGEwMTctYjgwZC00ZTMyLTk4MTMtNjA5MjQwNWMxMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753479/","name":"Chishû Ryû"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383261/","name":"Chieko Higashiyama"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0945522/","name":"Sô Yamamura"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654868/","name":"Yasujirô Ozu"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007001/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0633792/","name":"Kôgo Noda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654868/","name":"Yasujirô Ozu"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One is a comprehensive 1983, two-hour feature focused on Ozu's life and career, and the second is a 40-minute tribute from several international movie directors.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57009,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1953-11-03","keywords":"estrangement,family reunion,post world war two,japanese,generation gap","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2320022553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNGEwMTctYjgwZC00ZTMyLTk4MTMtNjA5MjQwNWMxMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNGEwMTctYjgwZC00ZTMyLTk4MTMtNjA5MjQwNWMxMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753479/","name":"Chishû Ryû","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383261/","name":"Chieko Higashiyama","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0945522/","name":"Sô Yamamura"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654868/","name":"Yasujirô Ozu"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007001/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0633792/","name":"Kôgo Noda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654868/","name":"Yasujirô Ozu"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It had been one of the scandalous, passionate, and morbid stories of the interwar period, a story that competed on the front pages of Parisian newspapers in 1933 with the news about Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, and which had divided the French public opinion into two camps, as no another sensational affair had since the Dreyfus case. The heroine of the gloomy story was a 16-year-old girl from a working / mid-class neighborhood, who had poisoned her parents. The father had died but the mother survived. The investigation revealed the double life of a girl suffocated by the environment in which she lived, considered a sinister criminal by some and a victim of social conditions and a perverse family environment by others. However, Chabrol only mentions in passing the media scandal around this case, being rather fascinated by the young woman's personality and also fascinating his spectators in the way he tells the story of the crime and the circumstances that led to its committing.\n\nThe whole film revolves around the heroine played by Isabelle Huppert. The script is quite faithful to the story, presents the facts as reported by the press of the time and does not try to serve surprises or insert speculative interpretations about the reasons for the actions and the psychological sources of the acts committed by the young woman. The director's attention is focused on reconstructing the confined and devoid of personal separation in which the Noziere family lives, the bohemian environment in which the young high school girl spends her time in the company of students, crooks, and old bourgeois who take advantage of the youth of girls in need for money or sensations. Rejecting both moral judgments and psychoanalytic interpretations, Chabrol lets Isabelle Huppert build the role of the girl who, instead of teenage dreams, plunges into promiscuity, and who travels from adolescent rebellion to murder with an impassive coldness. We don't find too many reasons in the film that would put us as spectators in the camp of Violette's supporters, except for the personality of the actress who fills the role with gloomy feelings and self-destructive tension.\n\nIsabelle Huppert achieves with the part of Violette in this film one of the first great roles of a fabulous career. She is supported by Stéphane Audran (the director's second wife, whom he would break up after 14 years of marriage and many remarkable films in the same year 1978) and Jean Carmet, one of those talented French actors whom Chabrol was giving the opportunity of consistent parts even if they were not first rank stars. A special award should be given to those who recognize Fabrice Luchini in one of the first roles of his film career. The style of the story is interesting and elaborate, temporally separated frames continue visually one another, flashbacks and imaginary scenes (especially from Violetta's fantasies or nightmares) are interleaved nervously and non-linearly, but perfectly following the logic of the action. 'Violette Noziere' manages to describe the interwar social environment, with social contradictions, moral prejudices, inequalities and stigmas related to the status of women and the pressure of the press of sensation. The film also intents to be a psychological study into the motives of the crime. Here, I think intentionally, the answer is not clear. We are shown the conditions that can generate crime, but not the gates that open between reality and horror. Judgments belong to us, the spectators.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2246,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1978-05-24","keywords":"teenage girl,male frontal nudity,male nudity,reference to louis xvi,reference to the dreyfus affair","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000804/","name":"Stéphane Audran"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0138405/","name":"Jean Carmet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001031/","name":"Claude Chabrol"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015884/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061460/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060193/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0058286/","name":"Odile Barski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111302/","name":"Hervé Bromberger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0340190/","name":"Frédéric Grendel"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The supporting cast is also quite good if more generalized in their characterizations, more a fault of the screenplay than the performers. There is one especially fine supporting performance from Lionel Jeffries as the maniacal Lord Queensbury. Jeffries plays Queensbury as a crazed brute, a type of man we can no longer countenance in these days, though I suspect they are still out there waiting for their chance to pounce on those who they fear and do not understand.\n\nSonia Dresdel is Lady Wilde, Oscar's dotty mother at the end of her life. It's a small part but is quietly powerful. Other people in Wilde's life, Constance, his wife, and Ada Leverson, his stalwart friend and life-long supporter, are tantalizingly glimpsed but little is revealed of their inner workings. But this isn't a film about them but about the actual trials and much of the film is spent in courtrooms. This might sound boring but it isn't.\n\nJames Mason appears in the first trial as the defending witness, for Lord Queensbury, and a more vicious, narrow-minded lawyer could hardly be found, even these days.\n\nThe technical credits are competent if nothing special; the music, melodramatic in a soap-opera-ish way, the sets plush and too clean. But somehow the power and tragedy of Wilde's story comes through all the gilding of the script, peppered with some of Wilde's wiser quotes, well-placed, naturally, in the text. There is nothing preachy or moralistic which is a relief, compared to the highly politicized scripts being written since this film was made.\n\nIt is interesting to note Nicholas Roeg as the camera operator. He wasn't the cinematographer but I detected a few Roeg-ish touches in a couple of the more meditative scenes.\n\nThis is not a film to be sluffed off as old-fashioned simply because there are no sex scenes or vulgar language or violence. The psychic violence suffered by Oscar Wilde was quite sufficient enough and this is a memorable film, worth having in the collection."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":888,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"keywords":"homophobia,homosexual history,based on true story,oscar wilde character,lord alfred douglas character","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002075/","name":"Peter Finch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593814/","name":"Yvonne Mitchell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000051/","name":"James Mason"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400731/","name":"Ken Hughes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103268/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103296/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400731/","name":"Ken Hughes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0405007/","name":"Montgomery Hyde"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0299019/","name":"John Furnell"}],"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I remember liking the opening sequence and thinking the rest was an empty bore. Well, it's no longer a bore to me, at 36, and it's far from empty, but it's still not the masterpiece to me that it seems to be to most film fans.\n\nThe coolest thing about 8 1/2 is the way that it's clearly a film about the film itself... a film about a filmmaker who is making a film, whose analysis of the film he's working on is actually an analysis of the film you are watching - as you're watching it. Conceptually, it's brilliant - and it does do a very good job of making these layered themes work. However, it's simply not that exciting to watch overall - at nearly 2 1/2 hours, it is a bit of a challenge to enjoy all the way through.

There's only one who's iconic but that's because her character represents "the devil" and she's only in a couple of quick scenes. Then, there's the stunning Claudia Cardinale who gets top billing but is actually only in about 1.5 scenes - and her primary scene is a very important one, one of the most important thematically, but, we don't really get much of HER from it. The rest just kind of redundantly trail off in nags throughout the movie - intentionally, but, it doesn't leave you with much. And Marcello Mastroianni's lead character Guido is a bit of a bore but he needs to be because that's kind of the point of the character. Again, it occurs with great purpose but it's simply not very entertaining to watch.\n\nIt's a complex film with a lot to offer, but not enough of what I enjoy about movies.

This one offers a very simple premise, almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time. It's surprising Ettore Scola's "Una giornate particulare" is relatively unheralded, even hated by some critics. Time Out calls it 'rubbish' and Leonard Maltin, somewhat milder, 'pleasant but trifling.' I disagree, not only because this film is deeply moving, but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist Italy than most films I've seen. The cinematography is distinctly unflashy, even a bit bland, and the storyline straightforward, which might explain the film's relative unpopularity. Considering late '70s audiences weren't exactly spoiled with great Italian films, it's even stranger this one didn't really catch on with the critics.\n\nThe film begins with a ten-minute collage of archive footage from Hitler's visit to Italy on may 8th 1938. Set against this background, we first meet Antonietta (Loren), a lonely, love-ridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building. One day, when her Beo escapes, she meets her neighbour Gabriele (Mastroianni), who seems to be only one in the building not attending the ceremonies. He is well-mannered, cultured and soon she is attracted to him. During the whole film, we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard.

After the opening scene, the camera swanks across the courtyard of the modernist (hypermodern at the time) apartment block, seemingly searching for our main characters, whom we haven't met yet. \n\nMarcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles, all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type. Canadian born John Vernon plays Loren's husband, but he is only on screen in the first and last scene. I figure his voice must have been dubbed, since he's not of Italian descent and never lived there, to my knowledge, so I cannot imagine he speaks Italian.

I also suppose that one should be charitable, given what was to follow in the form of the two subsequent 'sequels' after this (by which time even Brynner had jumped ship), both of which were absolutely and totally dire, leaving the original template of a truly immortal Japanese film which underlay the whole enterprise entirely (and mercifully) forgotten.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4079,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Action","Western"],"datePublished":"1966-10-19","keywords":"two gun holster,gun holster,gun,holster,double gun holster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1893122073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGZkYjQxNzAtMDBiMi00MzNkLTkxYzMtNGVmZWMyNjYzODE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGZkYjQxNzAtMDBiMi00MzNkLTkxYzMtNGVmZWMyNjYzODE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000989/","name":"Yul Brynner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298333/","name":"Robert Fuller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558290/","name":"Julián Mateos"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0447944/","name":"Burt Kennedy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054562/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064766/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0169540/","name":"Larry Cohen"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you want to see why, then watch this picture. Salkow has no sense of pacing whatsoever (a trait even more evident in his "Sitting Bull" from 1954, which has to be among the most disjointed pictures ever made). Stuff happens, then nothing happens for a while, then stuff happens again, then nothing happens for a while again, and so on, and so on, and so on. That describes this picture pretty much to a T, and what's even worse is that, unlike many of Salkow's other westerns, this one actually has a cast of experienced western actors in roles both large and small: James Best, Frank Ferguson, Rex Holman, Rick Vallin, Frank Gerstle and Mort Mills, among others, have done good work in other westerns, and Audie Murphy is earnest as always, but there's not much they can do with this. They try hard, but Salkow's limp direction and the drivel they're forced to recite kill whatever small chances there may have been of making something out of nothing. Even though the plot is somewhat tired, good--or even halfway competent--writing could have made this picture at least watchable. The writing here is laughable hack work, just cliché piled on top of cliché, overheated dramatics, eye-rolling villainy--it seems more like a William S. Hart western from 1915 than an Audie Murphy western from 1964. The last part of the picture picks up a bit--"picks up" being a relative term, considering that virtually nothing has happened up to that point--when the outlaw gang attacks the town, but even that isn't in the least exciting. Salkow's tenuous skills as a filmmaker completely evaporate when the "action" starts (again, check out his 1954 "Sitting Bull") and this picture is no exception--a few desultory gunshots and a bad guy falls off his horse, another gunshot or two and a townsman falls down (it's hard to tell if it's because he was "shot" or if he just dropped from exhaustion--the outlaws and the townsmen in this picture have to be among the OLDEST people to engage in a gun battle in the history of westerns) and the same thing is pretty much repeated for the next eight or ten minutes. There's no sense of excitement, danger, or anything other than boredom. In the end, of course, everything works out exactly as you knew it would, but it's not really worth sitting through this dull, lumbering mess to have your suspicions confirmed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":764,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Western"],"keywords":"gun,gunslinger,guns of the west,horse chase,hotel fight","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001559/","name":"Audie Murphy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0026039/","name":"Merry Anders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0078940/","name":"James Best"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0758508/","name":"Sidney Salkow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139591/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0193427/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448839/","name":"Robert E.

It's a magnificent film, recreating the known offensive by Nazi Panzer tanks on the Belgian front during 1944-45 .What happened during those desperate days that could have changed the course of war is now history . It's well recreated by Ken Annakin for Warner Bros, in Cinerama production with Technicolor cinematography by Jack Hildyard. The producer, Milton Sperling was well-qualified for his job but he was a marine officer and he had 10 combat cameramen, covering three battles during the war and made three documentaries out of those events. Sperling tells that making this film recalled his owns experiences in the war and made it quite possible for the sound effects you heard today to be as realistic as those he heard when was listening to them whining overhead.The making was a logistical problem as almost that of setting up a campaign and putting a film together under any circumstances was very difficult because working under very bad weather conditions. So this whole film was put together, photographed and edited, scored and prepared for release in a matter of about eight months. We scoured Europe,there are places where such tanks do exist,sometimes in junkyards, sometimes in existing armies and just by chance, one finds a cache of tanks, guns,old planes and various other relics .The equipment managed to assemble these great numbers of tanks after looking about for months and months. So what we see on the screen are truly the Tiger tanks that were fought in the battle and the Western Front, no wonder the battle scenes looked so authentic .Robert Shaw ,with his blue eyes blazing, is the fanatical tank commander, he was chosen because he can play virtually anything that's given to him.It was rather an obvious choice , there are so few good actors and he's capable of doing anything. Henry Fonda is terrific, as obstinate officer who finds vital German attacking position. In the remaining supporting cast appear Telly Savallas as a roguish sergeant, James McArthur as an unexperienced young lieutenant, George Montgomery as a valiant veteran sergeant, among others.\n\nThe Battle of Bulge film is based on true events about the Ardennes offensive, the real deeds are the following : It was a Hitler's plan code-named ¨Watch on the Rhine¨for a breakthrough by Field Marshal Von Rundstedt aimed at the US line in the Ardennes 16 Dec 1944 . Hitler aimed to isolate the Allied forces north of the corridor which would be created by a drive through the Ardennes, creating a German salient or bulge. There were 77.000 Allied casualties and 130.000 German, including Hitler's last powerful reserve of elite Panzer units. Although US troops were encircled for some weeks at Bastogne, the German counteroffensive failed. Three armies were deployed in the operation- Dietrich's 6th Panzer,the 5th Panzer, and the 7th Panzer-together with a 'Trojan Horse' force of English-speaking in US uniforms under Otto Skorzeny. The offensive opened 16 Dec along 113 Km of the front , aiming at the US 1st Army and General Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group. Initial progress was good as the Allies were unprepared for action along a section of the front hitherto so quiet it had been nicknamed ¨the Ghost Front¨and bad weather grounded Allied air support. However, the Germans failed to capture vital fuel dumps and the dogged Allied defense of St Vith and Bastogne seriously set the operation back. Bastogne was an important road junction, lay in the path of the German advance and was held by the US 101 Airbone Division. It was besieged by German forces 18 Dec and strongly attacked , the defenses were breached in two places . However the attacks were repulsed and was relieved by the US 4th Armored Division, though fierce fighting continued in the area for some days. The Allies quickly recovered from the initial shock and, while north of the Bulge General Bernard Montgomery blocked the German advance at the Meuse, to the south Bradley's forces also struck back, with General Patton breaking through to relieve Bastogne 26 Dec. By the end of Dec the weather improved, allowing the Allied air forces to play a part in the battle and by 3 Jan 1945 the Allies took the offensive , by 16 Jan the Bulge has been eliminated.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15539,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The wife buys the story but soon she begins to be haunted by dreams of voodoo and a mysterious woman coming to warn her. Ada Tauler, Jack Taylor, Vicky Adams and Karine Gambier star in this film, which is a remake of Franco's 1970 film Nightmares Come at Night, which wasn't the best film in the director's career but it's certainly better than this. The biggest difference between the two is that the original went for more of a psychological style while this one here is nothing but non-stop sex scenes, which grow quite boring after a while. There's some beautiful locations, a nice music score and great sets but that's about the only thing this film has going for it.

The wife buys the story but soon she begins to be haunted by dreams of voodoo and a mysterious woman coming to warn her. Ada Tauler, Jack Taylor, Vicky Adams and Karine Gambier star in this film, which is a remake of Franco's 1970 film Nightmares Come at Night, which wasn't the best film in the director's career but it's certainly better than this. The biggest difference between the two is that the original went for more of a psychological style while this one here is nothing but non-stop sex scenes, which grow quite boring after a while. There's some beautiful locations, a nice music score and great sets but that's about the only thing this film has going for it. There is one hot lesbian scenes and some really bad dialogue, which gets some laughs but you'll do better searching out other parts of Franco's career.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":638,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Adventure","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1977-12-09","keywords":"pseudo incest,female full frontal nudity,female full rear nudity,hairy labia,male full rear nudity","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10413561/","name":"Vicky Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0146517/","name":"Ada Tauler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0303715/","name":"Karine Gambier"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001238/","name":"Jesús Franco"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158418/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0226244/","name":"Erwin C.

The killer killed 12 of them..\n\nThis is not a serial killer who comes out of the blue.Tavernier takes time to describe his mind :he was bitten by a rabid dog (or more like as one scene in a church tells us ,he was raped by a priest),he served in the army but was discharged,and mainly the girl he loved did not want him anymore.He tried to kill her and to take his own life but he failed twice,and in the asylum,they wrecked his brain.Although he is a killer,he is actually a political prisoner:he realized that as far his crimes were concerned ,the blame had to be put on a criminal society:in a remarkable scene ,the judge's mother reads the reports concerning the awful crimes as if she 's reading the tittle-tattle of the town.The serial killer identifies himself with Jesus and Joan of Arc ...\n\nIn direct contrast to hîm,we have the judge :admirably portrayed by Tavernier's favourite actor ,Philippe Noiret,he epitomizes the bourgeoisie,the man who wants to keep the world as it is;this is a very complex opaque character:nearing 50,he stills lives with his mother,and he's got nasty habits (see the scene when he buggers Isabelle Huppert).\n\nThere are a lot of things to say about "le juge et l'assassin":the film successfully recreates the atmosphere of the period,not only by its hints at Dreyfus,at a country which is bent on revenge ,at a Church which feels its power slip away (the priest thundering against "school without God" ,about 10 years after Jules Ferry instituted secular education,and about 10 years before the separation of the Church and the State in France).But it even recreates it with its original songs ,which is quite a feat.We really feel we are in the time machine,and that's the main reason why Tavernier's movie is so precious:no one can find echoes of the seventies in France,which would have dated and marred the film.Even if the socialists appear at the end of the movie,there's no connection with their impending coming in the eighties.\n\nA masterpiece ,Tavernier's best film along with "la vie et rien d'autre".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1952,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"genre":["Crime","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1976-03-10","keywords":"reference to the virgin mary,confession of crime,murder confession,reference to robespierre,reference to emile zola","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1353302041","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkZTUzMWItY2NmZi00YWFhLTllZTMtZmQzNmFjNmFkY2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkZTUzMWItY2NmZi00YWFhLTllZTMtZmQzNmFjNmFkY2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634159/","name":"Philippe Noiret"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0301556/","name":"Michel Galabru"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851724/","name":"Bertrand Tavernier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012275/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029701/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079070/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0042179/","name":"Jean Aurenche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851724/","name":"Bertrand Tavernier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0098204/","name":"Pierre Bost"}],"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The killer killed 12 of them..\n\nThis is not a serial killer who comes out of the blue.Tavernier takes time to describe his mind :he was bitten by a rabid dog (or more like as one scene in a church tells us ,he was raped by a priest),he served in the army but was discharged,and mainly the girl he loved did not want him anymore.He tried to kill her and to take his own life but he failed twice,and in the asylum,they wrecked his brain.Although he is a killer,he is actually a political prisoner:he realized that as far his crimes were concerned ,the blame had to be put on a criminal society:in a remarkable scene ,the judge's mother reads the reports concerning the awful crimes as if she 's reading the tittle-tattle of the town.The serial killer identifies himself with Jesus and Joan of Arc ...\n\nIn direct contrast to hîm,we have the judge :admirably portrayed by Tavernier's favourite actor ,Philippe Noiret,he epitomizes the bourgeoisie,the man who wants to keep the world as it is;this is a very complex opaque character:nearing 50,he stills lives with his mother,and he's got nasty habits (see the scene when he buggers Isabelle Huppert).\n\nThere are a lot of things to say about "le juge et l'assassin":the film successfully recreates the atmosphere of the period,not only by its hints at Dreyfus,at a country which is bent on revenge ,at a Church which feels its power slip away (the priest thundering against "school without God" ,about 10 years after Jules Ferry instituted secular education,and about 10 years before the separation of the Church and the State in France).But it even recreates it with its original songs ,which is quite a feat.We really feel we are in the time machine,and that's the main reason why Tavernier's movie is so precious:no one can find echoes of the seventies in France,which would have dated and marred the film.Even if the socialists appear at the end of the movie,there's no connection with their impending coming in the eighties.\n\nA masterpiece ,Tavernier's best film along with "la vie et rien d'autre".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1952,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Crime","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1976-03-10","keywords":"reference to the virgin mary,confession of crime,murder confession,reference to robespierre,reference to emile zola","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1353302041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkZTUzMWItY2NmZi00YWFhLTllZTMtZmQzNmFjNmFkY2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkZTUzMWItY2NmZi00YWFhLTllZTMtZmQzNmFjNmFkY2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634159/","name":"Philippe Noiret","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0301556/","name":"Michel Galabru","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851724/","name":"Bertrand Tavernier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012275/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029701/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079070/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0042179/","name":"Jean Aurenche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851724/","name":"Bertrand Tavernier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0098204/","name":"Pierre Bost"],"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A washed out burnt down Chef has cleaned up, buffed his act up, and put himself together in an endeavour to pursue perfection. He is reaching out for a third Michelin star and anything less would end up getting burnt by his wrath.\n\nSo we know how recalcitrant chefs are. Seen enough Gordon Ramsay to reach that conclusion. Bradley as Adam Jones touches that nerve wrecking breakdown to achieve what he has planned to do. He shouts, despises, scorns and insults his crew to get their juices running. He doesn't care how evil he might look or sound while trying to get results. He is unaffected by emotions, reckless with his life but careful with the food he is preparing. If his preparation doesn't meet the standard in his head, he flings it away and doesn't even hold himself from bashing it to the wall. \n\nHe might be a man with a mission, but he is arrogant, mean and a heartless prick. He is also in a huge drug debt which gawks him from a distance, and occasionally batters him up good. He is trying hard to reach it, and there is always someone or something that messes him up and compels him to start at Ground Zero. \n\nWhat is quite interesting to watch is the brilliant presentation of its frames. The food shown in Burnt will at once make you hungry. There are great close up shots that will sizzle your palates. But everything disappears leaving you wanting for more. Also, there isn't one great recipe that is highlighted marvelously or shown being cooked proper which will bum foodies out. The story lacks substance which is sad. Screenplay of the flick is good. The score is kind of okay, but could have used some more depth. \n\nCooper fans are gonna love him in this new avatar. His acting is still very engaging. His dramatic bits are great to watch and Siena Miller complements him yet again quite beautifully. Daniel Bruhl plays Tony beautifully too. Emma Thompson has been given some marvelous lines, while Alicia Vikander has kind of a cameo in there. \n\nRemember the golden rule to truly enjoy anything: Don't compare! Burnt shouldn't be compared with other similar culinary movies in the library and you might relish it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":109190,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A washed out burnt down Chef has cleaned up, buffed his act up, and put himself together in an endeavour to pursue perfection. He is reaching out for a third Michelin star and anything less would end up getting burnt by his wrath.\n\nSo we know how recalcitrant chefs are. Seen enough Gordon Ramsay to reach that conclusion. Bradley as Adam Jones touches that nerve wrecking breakdown to achieve what he has planned to do. He shouts, despises, scorns and insults his crew to get their juices running. He doesn't care how evil he might look or sound while trying to get results. He is unaffected by emotions, reckless with his life but careful with the food he is preparing. If his preparation doesn't meet the standard in his head, he flings it away and doesn't even hold himself from bashing it to the wall. \n\nHe might be a man with a mission, but he is arrogant, mean and a heartless prick. He is also in a huge drug debt which gawks him from a distance, and occasionally batters him up good. He is trying hard to reach it, and there is always someone or something that messes him up and compels him to start at Ground Zero. \n\nWhat is quite interesting to watch is the brilliant presentation of its frames. The food shown in Burnt will at once make you hungry. There are great close up shots that will sizzle your palates. But everything disappears leaving you wanting for more. Also, there isn't one great recipe that is highlighted marvelously or shown being cooked proper which will bum foodies out. The story lacks substance which is sad. Screenplay of the flick is good. The score is kind of okay, but could have used some more depth. \n\nCooper fans are gonna love him in this new avatar. His acting is still very engaging. His dramatic bits are great to watch and Siena Miller complements him yet again quite beautifully. Daniel Bruhl plays Tony beautifully too. Emma Thompson has been given some marvelous lines, while Alicia Vikander has kind of a cameo in there. \n\nRemember the golden rule to truly enjoy anything: Don't compare! Burnt shouldn't be compared with other similar culinary movies in the library and you might relish it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":109190,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Jean (Pio Marmaï) left his family home ten years ago.

Their problems and conflicts seem very important for themselves, but are often difficult to understand for bystanders. This is also true for writer-director Cédric Klapisch's latest, slow-burning but quite nice drama about the importance of family and the power of forgiving. The short summary feels sugary, and Klapisch does aim for feel-good, but the movie does not try to manipulate with audience in any tasteless way. It is actually realistic depiction of well-behaved and intelligent family's life, where everybody has their problems but these are not solved in overtly dramatic way often expected from family sagas. This subtle approach doesn't make for very engaging drama, but the feel-good factor is important part of the movie. If you care to invest yourself in these characters' lives, you will probably feel like a part of their group in their end. Which is the best thing this kind of movie can ask for. One can also learn quite a lot about making and appreciating wine. 113 minutes makes it rather long watch, it's not a standout work but quietly confident and satisfying. I don't like international and also Estonian title Back to Burgundy" (Tagasi Burgundiasse") which is not as eloquent as the original – directly translated What Links Us" (Mis meid seob").

But the least glorious part of his job is that he doesn't sign them when these books are published. As he's hired to write the life of a famous football player, Kevin (Clovis Cornillac), he discovers that the latter's girlfriend is one of his old loves! With the indecision that best characterizes him, he tries to win her back while jeopardizing both his relationship with his current girlfriend Muriel and his work for the football player.\n\nThe thing that seduced me the most in this droll comedy as one could wish, although the director Laurent Tirard inserted melancholic moments which never break the tone and the storytelling of the film is the things Raphaël and Kevin say about books dealing with celebrities.

With his undetermined look, his inability to properly take a decision and assume it to the end, his awkward approach, Edouard Baer is a major asset for Tirard's film. He was the ideal man for this role unlike Claude Miller's versatile "Betty Fisher et Autres Histoires" (2001). And the direction of actors doesn't lie fallow. I was very taken with Marie-Josée Croze and the formidable sincerity she gave to her character Muriel. Clovis Cornillac is also well served with his football player Kevin who is as uncertain as Raphaël but on another basis. He doesn't know which style to confer to his biography! Why not "à la Charles Baudelaire"? Unless another idea comes to his mind...\n\nThe film showcases a scene which sums up best Raphaël's antsy state of mind: he's in his car on a street of Paris. The lights turn green but he doesn't move off and starts to cry. Not only because of Jeff's death but also because of the ghost life he leads in which he acts an impostor.

Seven years later, he finally returns, and with The Descendants, he returns with a bang.\n\nLike Sideways, his screenplay (co-written by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash) nails the tone right on the head. It has to balance out three tricky narratives in the film (Matt King's self-crisis, his comatose wife's affair with another man before her boating accident, and a land deal he's reported to make), and without the proper guidance it needed, along with Payne's own confidant direction, it could have faltered. Thankfully, it balances out heavy themes and complicated emotions in uncommon detail.\n\nThe characters in this movie are many, complicated, and sorrowful in their own unique ways. Matt King was a perfect role for George Clooney. He keeps his composure, but we can still see a very heavy, filtered sorrow beneath the surface. Shailene Woodley's character (Woodley, by the way, gives one of the year's best performances) begins with a rebellious, even angry sadness, but we can see her develop over the course of the film, gaining a strong maturity beyond her years. Judy Greer and Robert Forster are each given a few spare scenes, and they make every second of their screen time count.\n\nIt really is an emotional ride, even depressing sometimes, but I'm surprised by the occasional review I read where critics say they didn't feel the emotion to be sincere. In my opinion, the emotions of the film never hit a single false note. I don't think just anybody could have made this movie the way it is. This isn't a typical drama, the movie's genre is Payne, and he knows exactly what he's doing.\n\n***1/2 out of ****","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235017,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And what doesn't help matters is that they're of a thin interest. And so, so is the viewer's who slowly but surely wanes.

She has a place of her own to distance herself from her parents - Haiyan ("Arrival"'s Tzi Ma) and Lu Jian (Diana Lin) - but is struggling to fund it. But despite a typically spiky teenage relationship with her parents, family is important to her.\n\nThere's a big shock then when her beloved "Nai Nai" (Shuzhen Zhao) is diagnosed back in China with terminal cancer. The slight complication is that no-one has told her. Her younger sister (Hong Lu) has taken the decision to keep the news from her. This is in line with the Chinese saying "When people get Cancer they die". (Based on the rationale that it is not necessarily the disease that kills you, but the fear that destroys your useful life).\n\nThe whole extended family sign up - reluctantly - to the decision. They stage a final get together back in China around the pretence of a trumped-up wedding. This is between the comically reluctant grandson Hao Hao (Han Chen) and his new Japanese girlfriend Aiko (Aoi Mizuhara).\n\nFaced with seeing Nai Nai face-to-face, and being forced to "celebrate" together, can the family - and the emotionally attached Billi in particular - hold it together and keep the secret?\n\nYou might naturally assume that given the subject matter that this was going to be SERIOUSLY heavy going. And in many ways you would be right. Most of us over 50 will have lost an elderly relative. And, unless it was a sudden event, you have probably been through the mental pain of having to drive away from a nursing home certain that that will be the final time you will see your loved one alive. If you are therefore not affected by this film, you are not human.\n\nHowever, the film is so beautifully put together, and the comedy - albeit some of it very dark - so brilliantly inserted that the film is an UTTER DELIGHT from start to end. There are truly insightful scenes that get under the skin of the well-developed social approach in China to family. (Like my wife they love big family dinners around a round-table!) Although there is always the teen - Bau (Jinhang Liu) in this case - with his face permanently in his phone!\n\nThere are also scenes familiar to anyone who's visited China. The gaggle of "helpful" taxi drivers outside the airport made me laugh out loud.\n\nAlso (unintentionally) funny are the multiple company logos at the start of the film. (This is reminiscent of a classic "Family Guy" scene).\n\nFor such a 'small' film, the scale is sometimes truly cinematic. Director and writer, Lulu Wang, achieves some gloriously memorable movie moments. A stony-faced, determined march of the key players towards the camera - which could be subtitled "The Magnificent Eight" - is slo-mo'd for about 30 seconds and is utterly mesmeric. And a scene at a cemetery is a comic masterpiece of Chinese tradition. Bau of course still has his face in his phone throughout!\n\nThis is only Lulu Wang's second feature, but it makes me now want to check out her first film ("Posthumous").\n\nWhat I found particularly interesting is that the film is truly multi-cultural. It's not an American film with some local content crudely inserted to cater for the Far East markets. The film is an almost equal blend of American language and Mandarin language with subtitles.\n\nLulu Wang is also not afraid to upset officials in either country. Which is better: US or China? The question keeps getting posed to Billi and discussed among the family. And - as you might expect - there are positives and negatives on each side. The film doesn't really take sides. It's a really balanced position to take.\n\nThe music is by Alex Weston, and its one of the stars of the film. It's truly quirky with everything as diverse as a vocalised version of Beethoven's Sonata No. 8 "Pathetique"; a karaoke version of "Killing Me Softly"; and a hugely entertaining Chinese version of Niilson's "Without You" over the end titles.\n\nIt's a brilliant ensemble cast (SAG awards, are you listening?), and everyone pulls their weight. Even the minor members of the cast are superb: Aoi Mizuhara in particular displays acute awkwardness brilliantly!\n\nBut leading the charge is Awkwafina. She was in the disappointing "Ocean's 8" but much more memorable in "Crazy Rich Asians" as Rachel's wacky Singapore friend. Here it's a bravado performance that is genuinely moving. She IS the slightly sulky but emotionally crushed teen.\n\n"Sub-titles? I don't do sub-titles" - Get a grip! Yes, this is a film that has sub-titles. But it uses them when required (unless you happen to be fluent in Mandarin that is!). There is also a large percentage of the film that is in English. It's all eminently watchable, even for "sub-title-phobes".\n\nThis is a feelgood film about a tough subject. The ending of the film pulls off the trick of being both devastating and uplifting at the same time.\n\nSo get yourself to the cinema and see this film! Without question, it gets my "highly recommended" tag. It's also firmly placed itself very high up in my "Films of the Year" list.\n\nAnd it's all "based on a true lie"!\n\n(For the full graphical review, please go to One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

Sam Neill plays her husband, and appears to be an afterthought.  For animals lovers, this movie has a disturbing beginning.

He pulls off the quiet, but sturdy cowboy image with perfection.  Kristin Scott Thomas portrays Annie Maclean, a woman whose daughter's horse has been injured in an accident.  The same accident caused her daughter, Grace, portrayed by Scarlett Johansson,  to lose one of her legs.  She goes to Tom to get help for the "out of control" horse.  Sam Neill plays her husband, and appears to be an afterthought.  For animals lovers, this movie has a disturbing beginning.  The movie is about relationships, daughter to mother; child to horse; husband to wife; man to horse.  The scenery in this movie is breath taking, and Redford took full use of it while directing the movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40083,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance","Western"],"datePublished":"1998-05-15","keywords":"horse,horse trainer,mother daughter relationship,horse movie,montana","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robert Redford: The Con With Conviction &amp; the End of a Legendary Screen Persona","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi906672921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQzNjkwOTMtYTBiZC00YWExLTliNjktZWVhMmIwNGI4OTNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjQzNjkwOTMtYTBiZC00YWExLTliNjktZWVhMmIwNGI4OTNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After six decades in show business, Robert Redford announced that 2018's 'The Old Man &amp; the Gun' will be his last performance.

Its such a believable, everyday story, and it shows the way life really is. Two people meet, they have a sweet courting period, they're perfect together, they have a baby. And then its like two new people that have to start over with a new set of tough constraints &amp; pressures. But they muddle along and work together, on the baby and on their own lives at the same time.\n\nI thought this was an extremely well conveyed telling of a story that we all know, but that can't be told too often. Every instance of it is unique, but with universal themes.\n\nI enjoyed the drama-less drama of this movie: life itself in its mundane details is so dramatic!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4362,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2011-09-28","keywords":"antenatal class,french sex comedy,sex with a pregnant woman,husband wife relationship,ultrasound","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2864046/","name":"Louise Bourgoin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2847812/","name":"Pio Marmaï","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001929/","name":"Josiane Balasko"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1462495/","name":"Rémi Bezançon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032439/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172053/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0008399/","name":"Eliette Abecassis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1462495/","name":"Rémi Bezançon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4554522/","name":"Vanessa Portal"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

She has a place of her own to distance herself from her parents - Haiyan ("Arrival"'s Tzi Ma) and Lu Jian (Diana Lin) - but is struggling to fund it. But despite a typically spiky teenage relationship with her parents, family is important to her.\n\nThere's a big shock then when her beloved "Nai Nai" (Shuzhen Zhao) is diagnosed back in China with terminal cancer. The slight complication is that no-one has told her. Her younger sister (Hong Lu) has taken the decision to keep the news from her. This is in line with the Chinese saying "When people get Cancer they die". (Based on the rationale that it is not necessarily the disease that kills you, but the fear that destroys your useful life).\n\nThe whole extended family sign up - reluctantly - to the decision. They stage a final get together back in China around the pretence of a trumped-up wedding. This is between the comically reluctant grandson Hao Hao (Han Chen) and his new Japanese girlfriend Aiko (Aoi Mizuhara).\n\nFaced with seeing Nai Nai face-to-face, and being forced to "celebrate" together, can the family - and the emotionally attached Billi in particular - hold it together and keep the secret?\n\nYou might naturally assume that given the subject matter that this was going to be SERIOUSLY heavy going. And in many ways you would be right. Most of us over 50 will have lost an elderly relative. And, unless it was a sudden event, you have probably been through the mental pain of having to drive away from a nursing home certain that that will be the final time you will see your loved one alive. If you are therefore not affected by this film, you are not human.\n\nHowever, the film is so beautifully put together, and the comedy - albeit some of it very dark - so brilliantly inserted that the film is an UTTER DELIGHT from start to end. There are truly insightful scenes that get under the skin of the well-developed social approach in China to family. (Like my wife they love big family dinners around a round-table!) Although there is always the teen - Bau (Jinhang Liu) in this case - with his face permanently in his phone!\n\nThere are also scenes familiar to anyone who's visited China. The gaggle of "helpful" taxi drivers outside the airport made me laugh out loud.\n\nAlso (unintentionally) funny are the multiple company logos at the start of the film. (This is reminiscent of a classic "Family Guy" scene).\n\nFor such a 'small' film, the scale is sometimes truly cinematic. Director and writer, Lulu Wang, achieves some gloriously memorable movie moments. A stony-faced, determined march of the key players towards the camera - which could be subtitled "The Magnificent Eight" - is slo-mo'd for about 30 seconds and is utterly mesmeric. And a scene at a cemetery is a comic masterpiece of Chinese tradition. Bau of course still has his face in his phone throughout!\n\nThis is only Lulu Wang's second feature, but it makes me now want to check out her first film ("Posthumous").\n\nWhat I found particularly interesting is that the film is truly multi-cultural. It's not an American film with some local content crudely inserted to cater for the Far East markets. The film is an almost equal blend of American language and Mandarin language with subtitles.\n\nLulu Wang is also not afraid to upset officials in either country. Which is better: US or China? The question keeps getting posed to Billi and discussed among the family. And - as you might expect - there are positives and negatives on each side. The film doesn't really take sides. It's a really balanced position to take.\n\nThe music is by Alex Weston, and its one of the stars of the film. It's truly quirky with everything as diverse as a vocalised version of Beethoven's Sonata No. 8 "Pathetique"; a karaoke version of "Killing Me Softly"; and a hugely entertaining Chinese version of Niilson's "Without You" over the end titles.\n\nIt's a brilliant ensemble cast (SAG awards, are you listening?), and everyone pulls their weight. Even the minor members of the cast are superb: Aoi Mizuhara in particular displays acute awkwardness brilliantly!\n\nBut leading the charge is Awkwafina. She was in the disappointing "Ocean's 8" but much more memorable in "Crazy Rich Asians" as Rachel's wacky Singapore friend. Here it's a bravado performance that is genuinely moving. She IS the slightly sulky but emotionally crushed teen.\n\n"Sub-titles? I don't do sub-titles" - Get a grip! Yes, this is a film that has sub-titles. But it uses them when required (unless you happen to be fluent in Mandarin that is!). There is also a large percentage of the film that is in English. It's all eminently watchable, even for "sub-title-phobes".\n\nThis is a feelgood film about a tough subject. The ending of the film pulls off the trick of being both devastating and uplifting at the same time.\n\nSo get yourself to the cinema and see this film! Without question, it gets my "highly recommended" tag. It's also firmly placed itself very high up in my "Films of the Year" list.\n\nAnd it's all "based on a true lie"!\n\n(For the full graphical review, please go to One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

Not quite a classic but it has its moments and the leads are as good as the are in anything else.

This is the story of a young girl named Elsa who was raised by a single mother (Isabelle) in the city. Isabelle and Elsa begin the film moving in next door to an elderly man who collects butterflies (Julien). Isabelle who "spends a lot of time with her friends" does not pay much attention to her daughter who walks home because her mother forgot to pick her up from school.

Julien sets out on his annual attempt to find a rare species of butterfly that he had once promised his son he would find (son dead) in the French country side, specifically a region known as Vercors. Elsa stows away in his car. After being discovered she convinces him to let her come to Vercors with him. They bond while hiking and camping until Julien, who is initially annoyed by Elsa, near the end of the film seems to have a grandfather-granddaughter relationship with her. Elsa falls in a well. The police arrest Julien. Elsa tells everyone it is cool. Isabelle starts paying attention to her child. Julien and Elsa are friends.

The scenes with them on the moon, their first encounter on earth and their climactic fight against Superman in the skies above Metropolis are all outstanding.\n\nOnce again, Superman goes a little overboard in his romance to Lois Lane (do you believe some reviewers are upset there weren't explicit sex scenes in the film?) Hey, folks, it's just a comic book and it's supposed to be innocent, clean fun. Sorry that turns you off. For the rest of us, this is generally very enjoyable film from start to finish, with no real lulls.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100089,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT2H7M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The kids were terrible at acting, they made it seem like they were reading off a teleprompter the whole time. There were very few funny lines, and the kids seemed like nothing but potty mouth little brats.\n\nThe original is way better, the performance I saw by Walter Matthau in the original got me very excited because Billy Bob always plays a good drunk, but in this film Billy Bob was just too nice most of the time, so his character was a little too dull. If you enjoy baseball films then you might enjoy this, but I doubt even the biggest Billy Bob fan would give this 2 thumbs up...","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21141,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Sport"],"datePublished":"2005-07-22","keywords":"cigarette,team,coach,baseball,alcoholic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Bad News Bears (2005)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3784179993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNjlhMjctNjc4Zi00MzcxLThiYjctNjliN2ZhMDdkM2QwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzNjlhMjctNjc4Zi00MzcxLThiYjctNjliN2ZhMDdkM2QwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"pre st, grn band, "Coming Soon", lbx","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000671/","name":"Billy Bob Thornton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001315/","name":"Marcia Gay Harden"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000500/","name":"Richard Linklater"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0130439/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0123642/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0484111/","name":"Bill Lancaster","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275629/","name":"Glenn Ficarra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0720135/","name":"John Requa"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There are some similarities with "Mia and the Migou" (from the same Jacques-Remy Gired), but a lighter treatment of the ecological theme ; the balance is tipping a bit more on the comedy and poetry side which makes it more suitable for younger children. The theme doesn't deal with deforestation this time but genetically modified organisms and chemistry in agronomy. Still the message remains understandable by younger ones even if they can't understand the engineering at work. Animation process is lighter and brighter as well, colorfully sketched on white background. Scenario is inventive with many rebounds while the whole story remains linear and easy to understand for children. That doesn't means adults are forgotten; characters are caricatured but there is a second level for adults completely transparent and compatible with them (no sexual jokes nor anything like that ; the only victim would be political and capitalist greed).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"genre":["Animation","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2014-02-12","keywords":"aunt","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0044535/","name":"Sabine Azéma"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001929/","name":"Josiane Balasko"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0603586/","name":"François Morel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0157345/","name":"Benoît Chieux"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320868/","name":"Jacques-Rémy Girerd"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028384/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0296341/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320868/","name":"Jacques-Rémy Girerd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0157345/","name":"Benoît Chieux"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0853451/","name":"Iouri Tcherenkov"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There are some similarities with "Mia and the Migou" (from the same Jacques-Remy Gired), but a lighter treatment of the ecological theme ; the balance is tipping a bit more on the comedy and poetry side which makes it more suitable for younger children. The theme doesn't deal with deforestation this time but genetically modified organisms and chemistry in agronomy. Still the message remains understandable by younger ones even if they can't understand the engineering at work. Animation process is lighter and brighter as well, colorfully sketched on white background. Scenario is inventive with many rebounds while the whole story remains linear and easy to understand for children. That doesn't means adults are forgotten; characters are caricatured but there is a second level for adults completely transparent and compatible with them (no sexual jokes nor anything like that ; the only victim would be political and capitalist greed).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Animation","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2014-02-12","keywords":"aunt","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0044535/","name":"Sabine Azéma","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001929/","name":"Josiane Balasko","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0603586/","name":"François Morel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0157345/","name":"Benoît Chieux","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320868/","name":"Jacques-Rémy Girerd"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028384/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0296341/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320868/","name":"Jacques-Rémy Girerd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0157345/","name":"Benoît Chieux","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0853451/","name":"Iouri Tcherenkov"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The plot is rather simple: a French special forces unit (the movie is French/French-produced) is sent in to rescue a journalist from Afghanistan who has been captured by a Taliban warlord. Right off the bat, you are introduced to the principal characters, but not much is given in the way of character development or making the audience care, aside from some small character moments interspersed throughout the latter half of the film. The performances are adequate, with the best being given by Diane Kruger (as the journalist) and Djimon Hounsou (one of the special forces guys). The actor who portrays the Taliban warlord also does a good job, probably adding some depth to his character by having him be Western-educated and somewhat caught between Western culture and his own culture and beliefs, but not much attention is paid to his character either. It also doesn't help that his demise later in the film is done so haphazardly and unceremoniously. As far as the combat sequences go, they were fine and done in current "en vogue" style of somewhat shaky "cinema verite" realism to give a sense of the chaos of battle. The violence was effective and not gratuitous in any way. However, towards the end the movie drags a little bit as we're shown day after day passing of the core group trying to get away from their pursuers and safely back into Afghanistan (they've been wandering around in the Pakistani desert for most of the movie). Overall, the movie is effective in the combat sequences and showing how the special forces team bond with the people they try to rescue. Over the course of the film, you do grow to care a little bit more about the characters but not because you feel like you really know them, just because you empathize with the sticky situation they're in. The movie aspires to be SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (made by the French, and set during the Afghan war), but it falls short of the mark.

A car mechanic working in a small French town cannot sexually satisfy his much younger wife, who seems to be fascinated by murderers. His psychiatrist advises him to fake a confession to a murder, and he does - but (coincidence?) the following morning the revolting town bully who lived nearby is found murdered for real, with one of the mechanic's tools. Despite his claims that the confession was all a joke, the police arrest him and he becomes the hero of the town because everyone hated the victim. Meanwhile, his wife finds herself attracted to the psychiatrist, whom she suspects of being the true murderer....As a black comedy, this film is not very funny: in fact, I barely laughed once. It mostly depends on one joke - the entire town population worshipping the presumed murderer so much that they turn him into a local hero - which might have been shocking a few decades ago, but now, not so much. The film works better as a straight whodunit: the identity of the real murderer could have come right out of an Agatha Christie book, and "the moment of realization" is probably the best part of the film. In closing, I have to mention that Nadia Fares is one of the hottest actresses that French cinema has offered us in a long time. Not conventionally attractive, perhaps, certainly not "cute", but with a rough, "you don't want to mess with me" kind of sex appeal - and a knockout body.

The film mimics the comic-book visuals, with an interesting use of colors and contrasts, spectacularly directed fight scenes, and the amount of "monsters", violence and gore that surpasses most of the slasher horrors I've seen. The criteria by which films receive R rating are quite puritanical and conservative, and in most cases, the reasons for this rating are ridiculous to me, but with the explicitness of violence and to some extent sex, "300" definitely deserves it. But although it has an epic atmosphere and is visually breathtaking, overall it is not particularly strong or impressive. I saw it about a decade ago, and now while watching it again I remembered almost nothing. The story and dialogues occasionally step in unconvincing and even a comic exaggeration, and I think it is too morbid for a story it tells. As a fan of horror and all kinds of twisted movies, it was somewhat suitable for me, but I don't recommend it to a faint-hearted audience and by no means for children.\n\n7,5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":747498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The film mimics the comic-book visuals, with an interesting use of colors and contrasts, spectacularly directed fight scenes, and the amount of "monsters", violence and gore that surpasses most of the slasher horrors I've seen. The criteria by which films receive R rating are quite puritanical and conservative, and in most cases, the reasons for this rating are ridiculous to me, but with the explicitness of violence and to some extent sex, "300" definitely deserves it. But although it has an epic atmosphere and is visually breathtaking, overall it is not particularly strong or impressive. I saw it about a decade ago, and now while watching it again I remembered almost nothing. The story and dialogues occasionally step in unconvincing and even a comic exaggeration, and I think it is too morbid for a story it tells. As a fan of horror and all kinds of twisted movies, it was somewhat suitable for me, but I don't recommend it to a faint-hearted audience and by no means for children.\n\n7,5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":747498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And yet, despite its glaring flaws and imperfectness and lack of completion, you do find yourself strangely attached to it because it has a charm to itself that keeps you interested. Call it a guilty pleasure.\n\nMission: Impossible is my guilty pleasure. It's based on a 1960s television series created by Bruce Geller and the movie with Tom Cruise is kind of like a mash-up between The Bourne Identity and the James Bond pictures. Basically, the standard spy movie. Tom Cruise plays a spy who is falsely accused of betrayal to his organization and finds himself working with some unlikely partners to track down the real mole in the system and expose him and clear his name. Now, this is a plot as old as the hills and Mission: Impossible works with it just as well as the others. Not enormously well, but on an acceptable level.\n\nTom Cruise is great as the film's action hero lead, unfortunately his supporting cast is quite uninteresting. Another defect worth noting is the film's convoluted plot, which sometimes is hard to follow. This is caused by a screenplay in need of revisions. That's one of the film's major weaknesses and really the reason why it's just a standard spy movie with lots of cool gadgets instead of something special.\n\nBut that's really my only significant complaint about Mission: Impossible. Those rather small, unimportant defects left aside, and leaving the movie to its own devices, it works out well especially in its action sequences. Again, it's all been done before, sometimes better sometimes worse, but that doesn't meant it's boring or overdrawn. In fact, sometimes it's very primal. There is one scene in particular that I found intense and suspenseful on a hair-raising level. The scene goes on for an unremittingly long time, keeping us on the edges of our seats, and the best thing of all is that it's silent. The filmmakers could have chosen to go along with some dark, heavy music or some ominous heartbeat sound effects to put us in the same shoes with the characters, but the fact that it's quiettoo quiet for our likingmakes it so much more compelling.

And yet, despite its glaring flaws and imperfectness and lack of completion, you do find yourself strangely attached to it because it has a charm to itself that keeps you interested. Call it a guilty pleasure.\n\nMission: Impossible is my guilty pleasure. It's based on a 1960s television series created by Bruce Geller and the movie with Tom Cruise is kind of like a mash-up between The Bourne Identity and the James Bond pictures. Basically, the standard spy movie. Tom Cruise plays a spy who is falsely accused of betrayal to his organization and finds himself working with some unlikely partners to track down the real mole in the system and expose him and clear his name. Now, this is a plot as old as the hills and Mission: Impossible works with it just as well as the others. Not enormously well, but on an acceptable level.\n\nTom Cruise is great as the film's action hero lead, unfortunately his supporting cast is quite uninteresting. Another defect worth noting is the film's convoluted plot, which sometimes is hard to follow. This is caused by a screenplay in need of revisions. That's one of the film's major weaknesses and really the reason why it's just a standard spy movie with lots of cool gadgets instead of something special.\n\nBut that's really my only significant complaint about Mission: Impossible. Those rather small, unimportant defects left aside, and leaving the movie to its own devices, it works out well especially in its action sequences. Again, it's all been done before, sometimes better sometimes worse, but that doesn't meant it's boring or overdrawn. In fact, sometimes it's very primal. There is one scene in particular that I found intense and suspenseful on a hair-raising level. The scene goes on for an unremittingly long time, keeping us on the edges of our seats, and the best thing of all is that it's silent. The filmmakers could have chosen to go along with some dark, heavy music or some ominous heartbeat sound effects to put us in the same shoes with the characters, but the fact that it's quiettoo quiet for our likingmakes it so much more compelling. I only wish the rest of the movie was like this scene. Then it really would have been special.\n\nNevertheless, De Palma's Mission: Impossible works out well for what it is and unless you're not a fan of the standard spy movies or action pictures in particular, of if you have your standards and hopes up too high, I imagine you will enjoy it. Again, it is kind of a guilty pleasure, but hey, it was a lot of fun.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":396004,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There he meets a loony (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a secret paradise. He asks two strangers, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen who was really great in her first big American Film and good looking too by the way) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) to come and join them.\n\nAfter they have found the island they meet an alternative group who lives there and they join them, but after a while problems evolve and a minor 'hell' breaks loose.\n\nThis is the plain story-line of the movie, but there is so much more to it, it has a message and that really is what fascinated me a lot in the beginning and at the end. There was a good story there, but the way it was brought over, never really losing the actual message out of sight. Now believe me the direction, the soundtrack and the cast are good. There also is a bit gore, but it fits good in the movie and is not unnecessary.\n\nYet this film is not flawless, it was good entertainment over all, yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end, but in the middle when Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) loses it, so does the film and that is a shame.

There he meets a loony (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a secret paradise. He asks two strangers, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen who was really great in her first big American Film and good looking too by the way) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) to come and join them.\n\nAfter they have found the island they meet an alternative group who lives there and they join them, but after a while problems evolve and a minor 'hell' breaks loose.\n\nThis is the plain story-line of the movie, but there is so much more to it, it has a message and that really is what fascinated me a lot in the beginning and at the end. There was a good story there, but the way it was brought over, never really losing the actual message out of sight. Now believe me the direction, the soundtrack and the cast are good. There also is a bit gore, but it fits good in the movie and is not unnecessary.\n\nYet this film is not flawless, it was good entertainment over all, yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end, but in the middle when Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) loses it, so does the film and that is a shame. It is just too weird, too long and too incomprehensible (in the sense that the viewer himself doesn't know if it is real or not). It could have been so much better, but I guess it had to be.\n\nNO MUST SEE BUT DEFINATELY WORTH A TRIP TO THE VIDEOSTORE OR TO THE CINEMA AT A DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!\n\n7 out of 10\n\nP.S.

The sequence with the collapse of the bridge is very impressive. The acting is also good and in the end I liked this film.

The survivors learn that if they trade spots with another victim, they receive the years left in the live of the victim. \n\nWhen I see the franchise "Final Destination, I know exactly what I am going to see: a group of teenagers escaping from death in a first moment and then death chases each one of them since the storyline is always the same. \n\n"Final Destination 5" has excellent CGI and very creative deaths and never disappoints; therefore the intention of the director is accomplished. The sequence with the collapse of the bridge is very impressive. The acting is also good and in the end I liked this film. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Premonição 5" ("Premonition 5")","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110252,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-08-12","keywords":"suspension bridge,gymnast,death of protagonist,eyeball run over by car,fall out window","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3590233113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Survivors of a suspension bridge collapse frantically work together to try and outwit Death and its sinister agenda.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194900/","name":"Nicholas D'Agosto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068187/","name":"Emma Bell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0260224/","name":"Arlen Escarpeta"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702797/","name":"Steven Quale"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0236019/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2104063/","name":"Eric Heisserer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714695/","name":"Jeffrey Reddick"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The premise was pretty good, the cast was good, and the twists were pretty smart and executed fairly well. I do however think it was a little slow, and there were a few tiny technical details they should have not played with that were just annoying.\n\nThe biggest thing that killed me is accents. Yes, accents. First, if you want to make a film that is firmly rooted in the U.S., why does someone go out of their way to hire foreign actors. OK, Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig are probably a package deal since they are married, then they throw in an Aussie with Naomi Watts ( who, by the way was probably the only one that pulled it off). Daniel Craig's character, whether by plot design, or just plain bad fluctuates between his regular British accent, a plain American accent, and a tiny bit of an American southern twang accent. If this isn't bad ( or at least confusing) enough, you have the beautiful European ( Hungarian/Austrian) woman that grew up in England, Rachel Weisz, speaking in a southern accent. Please, just let Rachel Weisz use her own accent, it is sexy, and it would not have made a difference at all, but alas, it was the little thing that annoyed me the most.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64948,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-09-30","keywords":"psychiatric hospital,real life sisters playing sisters,last day on the job,dead family,custody battle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dream House","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi64658457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MjkwNjk5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0NDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MjkwNjk5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0NDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Soon after moving into their seemingly idyllic new home, a family learns of a brutal crime committed against former residents of the dwelling.

The premise was pretty good, the cast was good, and the twists were pretty smart and executed fairly well. I do however think it was a little slow, and there were a few tiny technical details they should have not played with that were just annoying.\n\nThe biggest thing that killed me is accents. Yes, accents. First, if you want to make a film that is firmly rooted in the U.S., why does someone go out of their way to hire foreign actors. OK, Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig are probably a package deal since they are married, then they throw in an Aussie with Naomi Watts ( who, by the way was probably the only one that pulled it off). Daniel Craig's character, whether by plot design, or just plain bad fluctuates between his regular British accent, a plain American accent, and a tiny bit of an American southern twang accent. If this isn't bad ( or at least confusing) enough, you have the beautiful European ( Hungarian/Austrian) woman that grew up in England, Rachel Weisz, speaking in a southern accent. Please, just let Rachel Weisz use her own accent, it is sexy, and it would not have made a difference at all, but alas, it was the little thing that annoyed me the most.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64948,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-09-30","keywords":"psychiatric hospital,real life sisters playing sisters,last day on the job,dead family,custody battle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dream House","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi64658457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MjkwNjk5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0NDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MjkwNjk5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE0NDQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Soon after moving into their seemingly idyllic new home, a family learns of a brutal crime committed against former residents of the dwelling.

Surprisingly enough, the age gap does not mean a thing for them: they mesh like magic. It looks as if they were born the same day. One day, Madeleine escapes from the nursing home where she has been placed against her will by her sons (one of whom, Michel, is Romain's father). Romain asks his employer for a leave and joins her in Etretat.

Jay has lost his father early in life, and has to act as a pseudo parent for his mother who suffers from the breakup. He accidentally discovers that his much older neighbour Frosty is a big wave surfer and so a teacher mentor relationship starts. Frosty, as well, has terrible father issues which continue to plague him. Their relationship develops momentum and gives each of them energy and purpose. The film underlines the choices we can make in life. Everyone has scars and issues to deal with. Do we give up and spiral downwards or do we set big goals (waves) and go after them.

However, films about politicians and those around them seem to be more successful than the politicians themselves. A good example in this regard is 'Alice et le maire' ('Alice and the Mayor') a film that comes from France, a country that seems to be in recent years in a permanent state of dissatisfaction with the existing economic and social order, with its political institutions and with members of the political class. The film, whose action takes place a few years ago at the City Hall of Lyon and in the milieu of the municipal and political bureaucracy of the Socialist Party, enjoyed an unexpected success without even resorting to sensationalist issues such as crime, sex, or corruption scandals. Perhaps precisely through the relaxed and slightly humorous approach, the script written by Nicolas Pariser (who is also the director of the film) reaches more effectively aspects of deeper, systemic corruption of the French political machinery.\n\nHowever, the premises of the story do not seem too credible. I am not very familiar with the French political system, but I believe that even in France there are no positions for philosophers advisers to the mayors, paid on public money, nor that politicians with decades of political activity and presidential ambitions publicly declare that they are short of ideas. Probably, then, only in the films Alice (Anaïs Demoustier), a fresh graduate from Oxford, could she employed at the City Hall in Lyon just to provide ideas to Mayor Paul Theraneau (Fabrice Luchini) and that could become in a few days or weeks involved at top level in the affairs of the city and of the Socialist Party. The activity of the party on the public money of the town hall also seems little plausible. Probably the whole situation should be viewed more as a cinematic convention rather than real events in the immediate actuality. But even so, the dialogues between the mayor and the young philosopher represent the guiding thread and the most successful and probably the most important part of the movie from the point of view of the filmmakers.\n\nThe discussions between the two protagonists work very well thanks to the charm and the talent of the two actors. The mayor's role is written for Fabrice Luchini who lends to the character his noble style, intellectual charisma and impeccable French language, serving us even with a reading from a book, one of those that made him famous in France. Anaïs Demoustier copes well with the scenes that she shares with Luchini, but also with those that describe her personal dilemmas and the confrontation with the municipal bureaucracy. Secondary roles create believable portrait sketches of Alice's friends and of the politicians and bureaucrats in the town hall hierarchy. The story, however, stumbles badly towards the end, when the politician's decision or indecision at critical moments is difficult to understand, perhaps due to the use of details related to party politics. French viewers might be better off deciphering such details as well as some of the literary and cultural references appearing in discussions, but cinematically the story does not hold water. The approach of 'Alice and the Mayor' is comical and empathetic towards the heroes, the ending is open, so what we get is pleasant entertainment around a political topic. Of course, there will be other films that will address the troubled French political actuality with different approaches and from many other points of view.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"lyon france,mayor,politics,female protagonist,year 2017","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2747252249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1326732/","name":"Anaïs Demoustier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3937233/","name":"Nora Hamzawi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093091/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625796/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The ick abounds in "Maps to the Stars," a fascinating film that must be something like what watching a grisly car accident in slow motion would feel like.\n\nJulianne Moore won her Oscar for the bland and award-bait "Still Alice" last year, but THIS is the movie for which she should have won. Utterly lacking in vanity, Moore tears into the role of a washed up actress struggling night and day to stage her comeback. Think Norma Desmond without the black and white studio sheen of "Sunset Boulevard" and the filters that were necessarily in place back when Billy Wilder's dark satire was released. This film is like rummaging through Norma Desmond's underwear. Mia Wasikowska is great as well as Moore's hanger on and personal assistant who unravels and goes off the deep end and beyond. Swirling around these two characters are plot lines involving a troubled child star, lots and lots of incest, and enough frantic desperation to fill a sequel to "Mulholland Drive." \n\nWhenever I see a movie like this, I immediately wonder how true it is vs. how exaggerated for effect. For example, did Halle Berry or Nicole Kidman at one point in their careers have to subject themselves to the indignities shown or implied in this film? But then I think there has to be a lot of truth to movies like this, "Mulholland Drive," etc., which makes me glad I decided to be an anonymous Joe as opposed to a superstar. For every Julia Roberts, there are hundreds, maybe thousands, of desperate people out there waiting for the big break that will never come, or who can't handle it when it eventually does.\n\nGrade: A-","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39400,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-05-21","keywords":"aspiring actor,dysfunctional family,male frontal nudity,sex,brother sister incest","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2046471705","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MTc5MDkzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA4NjQ5MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MTc5MDkzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA4NjQ5MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A tour into the heart of a Hollywood family chasing celebrity, one another and the relentless ghosts of their pasts.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985859/","name":"Mia Wasikowska"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000343/","name":"David Cronenberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0138248/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0321306/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315467/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905818/","name":"Bruce Wagner"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The ick abounds in "Maps to the Stars," a fascinating film that must be something like what watching a grisly car accident in slow motion would feel like.\n\nJulianne Moore won her Oscar for the bland and award-bait "Still Alice" last year, but THIS is the movie for which she should have won. Utterly lacking in vanity, Moore tears into the role of a washed up actress struggling night and day to stage her comeback. Think Norma Desmond without the black and white studio sheen of "Sunset Boulevard" and the filters that were necessarily in place back when Billy Wilder's dark satire was released. This film is like rummaging through Norma Desmond's underwear. Mia Wasikowska is great as well as Moore's hanger on and personal assistant who unravels and goes off the deep end and beyond. Swirling around these two characters are plot lines involving a troubled child star, lots and lots of incest, and enough frantic desperation to fill a sequel to "Mulholland Drive." \n\nWhenever I see a movie like this, I immediately wonder how true it is vs. how exaggerated for effect. For example, did Halle Berry or Nicole Kidman at one point in their careers have to subject themselves to the indignities shown or implied in this film? But then I think there has to be a lot of truth to movies like this, "Mulholland Drive," etc., which makes me glad I decided to be an anonymous Joe as opposed to a superstar. For every Julia Roberts, there are hundreds, maybe thousands, of desperate people out there waiting for the big break that will never come, or who can't handle it when it eventually does.\n\nGrade: A-","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39400,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-05-21","keywords":"aspiring actor,dysfunctional family,male frontal nudity,sex,brother sister incest","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2046471705","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MTc5MDkzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA4NjQ5MzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU4MTc5MDkzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA4NjQ5MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A tour into the heart of a Hollywood family chasing celebrity, one another and the relentless ghosts of their pasts.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985859/","name":"Mia Wasikowska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000343/","name":"David Cronenberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0138248/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0321306/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315467/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905818/","name":"Bruce Wagner"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

From the title, I was sure I'd see a portmanteau movie of unconnected short stories, similar to 1983's "Twilight Zone: The Movie". But with a kid-centric plot and set in a small American town, the formula is similar to "It" or "Super 8". However, the episodic nature of serial "incidents" aligns it more with the style of the "Final Destination" films.\n\nStella Nicholls (Zoe Margaret Colletti) is a horror geek and aspiring writer living in Mill Valley, a small Pennsylvanian town during the Nixon election of 1968. Stella has a couple of friends: the requisite Scoobie Doo Shaggy character Chuck (Austin Zajur) and the 'sensible' "it's all science" character Auggie (Gabriel Rush). But pursued by local hoodlum Tommy (Austin Abrams), Stella, Chuck and Auggie are thrown together with draft-dodging outsider Ramón (Michael Garza).\n\nThey escape into the local spooky house - a house where legend has it that terrible things were done to a strange albini girl, Sarah. That legend has it that Sarah used to tell local kids scary stories through the walls. And Stella finds a book... a book that appears to be unfinished....\n\nThis is a time when horror films are either "old school" or more psychological in nature (like "Hereditary"). This one has Guillermo del Toro's hand behind that of lead-writers Dan and Kevin Hagerman. And it's firmly old-school. There are some effective (but at times comically created) spooky moments that are scary without being hugely gory. This earns it a UK15, rather than a UK18, certificate. It's disappointing that doesn't stretch to 12A to attract a younger teenage audience, since the source material is actually from a "Goosebumps"-like set of short stories by Alvin Schwartz.\n\nThe story's 'episodes' are nicely varied. At the gross-out end of the scale is an episode with Chuck's sister Ruth (Natalie Ganzhorn) that might get arachnophobes running for the exits. My personal favourite? A 'red room' episode with the oncoming fate comically arriving in slow-motion like the steam-roller in "Austin Powers"!\n\nThis is another film that relies on the quality of its young cast, with the only moderately well-know cast name being Gil Bellows as the local sheriff. In this regard, the stand-out performance is that of Zoe Margaret Colletti who does a fabulous job as Stella. She's been in a few films in the past ("Annie", "Wildlife" and "Skin") but this is her breakout performance in a starring role. She's done her CV a great favour here.\n\nDirected by "Troll Hunter" director André Øvredal, I really enjoyed this one. I'm not a massive fan of 'slasher' style horror films. I have no burning desire to be constantly reminded of what the inside of my body looks like. So this turned out to be much-more to my liking than the normal horror flick. It had enough spookiness to make me turn on the lights when I got back home, but not enough to pervade my dreams.\n\nThe young cast perform well. They are given enough back-story and personality by the script to make you care about their fate.\n\nSo overall, this one comes with a "Recommended for wimps" (like me)!\n\n(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook.

As a fix for this problem, his aides bring a brilliant young philosopher, into his inner circle.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt8903840/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"dromasca"},"dateCreated":"2020-01-05","inLanguage":"English","name":"the mayor and the philosopher","reviewBody":"Politicians and the bureaucracy around them (political parties, parliaments, governments, mayors) do not enjoy a good rating nowadays. However, films about politicians and those around them seem to be more successful than the politicians themselves. A good example in this regard is 'Alice et le maire' ('Alice and the Mayor') a film that comes from France, a country that seems to be in recent years in a permanent state of dissatisfaction with the existing economic and social order, with its political institutions and with members of the political class. The film, whose action takes place a few years ago at the City Hall of Lyon and in the milieu of the municipal and political bureaucracy of the Socialist Party, enjoyed an unexpected success without even resorting to sensationalist issues such as crime, sex, or corruption scandals. Perhaps precisely through the relaxed and slightly humorous approach, the script written by Nicolas Pariser (who is also the director of the film) reaches more effectively aspects of deeper, systemic corruption of the French political machinery.\n\nHowever, the premises of the story do not seem too credible. I am not very familiar with the French political system, but I believe that even in France there are no positions for philosophers advisers to the mayors, paid on public money, nor that politicians with decades of political activity and presidential ambitions publicly declare that they are short of ideas. Probably, then, only in the films Alice (Anaïs Demoustier), a fresh graduate from Oxford, could she employed at the City Hall in Lyon just to provide ideas to Mayor Paul Theraneau (Fabrice Luchini) and that could become in a few days or weeks involved at top level in the affairs of the city and of the Socialist Party. The activity of the party on the public money of the town hall also seems little plausible. Probably the whole situation should be viewed more as a cinematic convention rather than real events in the immediate actuality. But even so, the dialogues between the mayor and the young philosopher represent the guiding thread and the most successful and probably the most important part of the movie from the point of view of the filmmakers.\n\nThe discussions between the two protagonists work very well thanks to the charm and the talent of the two actors. The mayor's role is written for Fabrice Luchini who lends to the character his noble style, intellectual charisma and impeccable French language, serving us even with a reading from a book, one of those that made him famous in France. Anaïs Demoustier copes well with the scenes that she shares with Luchini, but also with those that describe her personal dilemmas and the confrontation with the municipal bureaucracy. Secondary roles create believable portrait sketches of Alice's friends and of the politicians and bureaucrats in the town hall hierarchy. The story, however, stumbles badly towards the end, when the politician's decision or indecision at critical moments is difficult to understand, perhaps due to the use of details related to party politics.

However, films about politicians and those around them seem to be more successful than the politicians themselves. A good example in this regard is 'Alice et le maire' ('Alice and the Mayor') a film that comes from France, a country that seems to be in recent years in a permanent state of dissatisfaction with the existing economic and social order, with its political institutions and with members of the political class. The film, whose action takes place a few years ago at the City Hall of Lyon and in the milieu of the municipal and political bureaucracy of the Socialist Party, enjoyed an unexpected success without even resorting to sensationalist issues such as crime, sex, or corruption scandals. Perhaps precisely through the relaxed and slightly humorous approach, the script written by Nicolas Pariser (who is also the director of the film) reaches more effectively aspects of deeper, systemic corruption of the French political machinery.\n\nHowever, the premises of the story do not seem too credible. I am not very familiar with the French political system, but I believe that even in France there are no positions for philosophers advisers to the mayors, paid on public money, nor that politicians with decades of political activity and presidential ambitions publicly declare that they are short of ideas. Probably, then, only in the films Alice (Anaïs Demoustier), a fresh graduate from Oxford, could she employed at the City Hall in Lyon just to provide ideas to Mayor Paul Theraneau (Fabrice Luchini) and that could become in a few days or weeks involved at top level in the affairs of the city and of the Socialist Party. The activity of the party on the public money of the town hall also seems little plausible. Probably the whole situation should be viewed more as a cinematic convention rather than real events in the immediate actuality. But even so, the dialogues between the mayor and the young philosopher represent the guiding thread and the most successful and probably the most important part of the movie from the point of view of the filmmakers.\n\nThe discussions between the two protagonists work very well thanks to the charm and the talent of the two actors. The mayor's role is written for Fabrice Luchini who lends to the character his noble style, intellectual charisma and impeccable French language, serving us even with a reading from a book, one of those that made him famous in France. Anaïs Demoustier copes well with the scenes that she shares with Luchini, but also with those that describe her personal dilemmas and the confrontation with the municipal bureaucracy. Secondary roles create believable portrait sketches of Alice's friends and of the politicians and bureaucrats in the town hall hierarchy. The story, however, stumbles badly towards the end, when the politician's decision or indecision at critical moments is difficult to understand, perhaps due to the use of details related to party politics. French viewers might be better off deciphering such details as well as some of the literary and cultural references appearing in discussions, but cinematically the story does not hold water. The approach of 'Alice and the Mayor' is comical and empathetic towards the heroes, the ending is open, so what we get is pleasant entertainment around a political topic. Of course, there will be other films that will address the troubled French political actuality with different approaches and from many other points of view.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"lyon france,mayor,politics,female protagonist,year 2017","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2747252249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1326732/","name":"Anaïs Demoustier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3937233/","name":"Nora Hamzawi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093091/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625796/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

My five minutes of heaven!'

Flash forward to 2008 when Alistair Little (now Liam Neeson) has served his prison term and is set up by the media to relate the story of the incident and supposedly meet and shake hands on camera with the now mature Joe Griffen. It is a film about youthful involvement in terrorism and the sequelae that haunts or obsesses the victim's family and the perpetrator. The confrontation between Alistair and Joe is a devastating one. \n\nGuy Hibbert wrote this excruciatingly visceral screenplay and Oliver Hirschbiegel directs a first rate cast. Though Liam Neeson is billed as the star, the film belongs to the powerful acting by James Nesbitt as the vengeful Joe Griffen. The cinematography is dark and dank like the atmosphere in both the warring fog of 1975 and the attempt at reconciliation in 2008. There are subtle pieces of thoughtful enhancement, such as the use of the Mozart 'Requiem' in the near hidden score. In all, this is a moving film about truth and reconciliation that deserves the attention of us all, especially in this time of random acts of terrorism and their possible imprint on our minds and on society. \n\nGrady Harp","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12501,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-02-27","keywords":"reconciliation,vengeance,title spoken by character,cell phone,ireland","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Five Minutes of Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi590807577","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3MDgyNzQxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA0OTUyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3MDgyNzQxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA0OTUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Lurgan Northern Ireland, 1975.

Flash forward to 2008 when Alistair Little (now Liam Neeson) has served his prison term and is set up by the media to relate the story of the incident and supposedly meet and shake hands on camera with the now mature Joe Griffen. It is a film about youthful involvement in terrorism and the sequelae that haunts or obsesses the victim's family and the perpetrator. The confrontation between Alistair and Joe is a devastating one. \n\nGuy Hibbert wrote this excruciatingly visceral screenplay and Oliver Hirschbiegel directs a first rate cast. Though Liam Neeson is billed as the star, the film belongs to the powerful acting by James Nesbitt as the vengeful Joe Griffen. The cinematography is dark and dank like the atmosphere in both the warring fog of 1975 and the attempt at reconciliation in 2008. There are subtle pieces of thoughtful enhancement, such as the use of the Mozart 'Requiem' in the near hidden score. In all, this is a moving film about truth and reconciliation that deserves the attention of us all, especially in this time of random acts of terrorism and their possible imprint on our minds and on society. \n\nGrady Harp","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12501,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-02-27","keywords":"reconciliation,vengeance,title spoken by character,cell phone,ireland","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Five Minutes of Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi590807577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3MDgyNzQxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA0OTUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3MDgyNzQxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA0OTUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Lurgan Northern Ireland, 1975. A low level civil war has been underway, with the IRA targeting British loyalists and the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force exacting revenge on Catholics they claim are militant republicans. Alistair Little, 16 is the leader of a UVF cell, eager to be blooded. He and his gang are given the go ahead to kill a young Catholic man, James Griffin, as a reprisal and a warning to others. When the hit is carried out, Joe Griffin - the 11-year old little brother of the target - watches in horror his brother is shot in the head. Thirty years later Joe Griffin and Alistair are to meet, on camera, with a view to reconciliation. Alistair has served his sentence, and Peace may been agreed in N. Ireland, but unbeknownst to the production team, Joe Griffin, is not coming on the program for a handshake but to stick a knife in his brother's killer - live on air.

The conversation Paul has with Jon's forlorn girl-friend about his theory of sadness is also very moving, as is Paul's reading of the children's storybook to his younger brother, if both are somewhat obscure.The father preparing dinner whilst his estranged wife outlines the difficulties of their previous relationship seems rooted in reality. Paul's self-destructive behaviour and the see-saw moods of his relationship are bizarre believable.

The conversation Paul has with Jon's forlorn girl-friend about his theory of sadness is also very moving, as is Paul's reading of the children's storybook to his younger brother, if both are somewhat obscure.The father preparing dinner whilst his estranged wife outlines the difficulties of their previous relationship seems rooted in reality. Paul's self-destructive behaviour and the see-saw moods of his relationship are bizarre believable. The relationships are discussed in a way that is both reflective and expressive, such a change from the cutesy-clichés of American romances.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-10-04","keywords":"male frontal nudity,barefoot male,bare chested male,bare breasts,male full rear nudity","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244151/","name":"Romain Duris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308039/","name":"Louis Garrel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2372335/","name":"Alice Butaud"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393394/","name":"Christophe Honoré"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067852/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093907/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393394/","name":"Christophe Honoré"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A working guy (Andrew Garfield), who is evicted from his home, attempts to make his way up the capitalist dungheap by making himself useful to the guy (Michael Shannon) whose company oversaw the eviction.\n\nAndrew Garfield is not obvious casting for this blue-collar role, but he is a sympathetic presence. He wears his vulnerability so openly, like a contemporary Anthony Perkins, that you can't help but feel for his character as he digs himself deeper and deeper into the mire. Michael Shannon, superb, is only too believable as a man who strives to have no conscience.\n\nThere is no doubt that Bahrani is a fine filmmaker, and I'm sure there'll be more high-standard stuff to come from him. His observation of male behaviour when under pressure is acute and compassionate. His weak spot, on the basis of the two movies of his that I've seen, is that his female characters are so insubstantial. The excellent Laura Dern does her best here with not much to go on.\n\nThere is also an excellent supporting performance from Noah Lomax as Garfield's young son.\n\nWell worth seeing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32052,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-09","keywords":"motel,cheating,ethics,theft,promise","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi775204889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2NDQ3NzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0OTg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2NDQ3NzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0OTg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Charismatic and ruthless businessman Rick Carver is making a killing by repossessing homes - gaming the real estate market, Wall Street banks and the US government. When he evicts Dennis Nash, a single father trying to care for his mother and young son, Nash becomes so desperate to provide for his family that he goes to work for Carver - the very man who evicted him in the first place.

A working guy (Andrew Garfield), who is evicted from his home, attempts to make his way up the capitalist dungheap by making himself useful to the guy (Michael Shannon) whose company oversaw the eviction.\n\nAndrew Garfield is not obvious casting for this blue-collar role, but he is a sympathetic presence. He wears his vulnerability so openly, like a contemporary Anthony Perkins, that you can't help but feel for his character as he digs himself deeper and deeper into the mire. Michael Shannon, superb, is only too believable as a man who strives to have no conscience.\n\nThere is no doubt that Bahrani is a fine filmmaker, and I'm sure there'll be more high-standard stuff to come from him. His observation of male behaviour when under pressure is acute and compassionate. His weak spot, on the basis of the two movies of his that I've seen, is that his female characters are so insubstantial. The excellent Laura Dern does her best here with not much to go on.\n\nThere is also an excellent supporting performance from Noah Lomax as Garfield's young son.\n\nWell worth seeing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32052,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-09","keywords":"motel,cheating,ethics,theft,promise","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi775204889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2NDQ3NzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0OTg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2NDQ3NzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0OTg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Charismatic and ruthless businessman Rick Carver is making a killing by repossessing homes - gaming the real estate market, Wall Street banks and the US government.

It's definitely one of the most depressing films I've ever seen.\n\nManchester by the Sea tells the story of a depressed man named Lee who has to take care of his brother's son after his unfortunate death.\n\nThis is not a film that you go to watch for a good time. Manchester by the Sea made me feel really sad throughout the entirety of it and it's mainly done through the amazing performances and level of authenticity writer-director Kenneth Lonergan creates. This film is very simple. It's not stylish in any way and Lonergan's script maintains the realism through the runtime. At no point did I think there were actors playing the characters because the performances and conversations they were all having seemed too real. This made Lonergan's story about guilt, pain and depression more impactful and heartbreaking.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a career best performance by Casey Affleck. It's a performance that's rather sombre instead of flashy. His facial expressions are very subtle but you can still tell how broken and unhappy of a man he is. When you first see his character, you tend to dislike him but after finding out the reason why he's so miserable, you root for him and want him to recover from his depressive state. Michelle Williams isn't in the film much but she's brilliant in all the scenes she's present in. I thought Lucas Hedges was good but there were times where I found his accent quite jarring and a scene where he cries didn't seem too realistic.\n\nIt's best going into Manchester by the Sea not knowing much as I feel it makes the film more poignant.

Although it is far from a straightforward genre film, its atmosphere still reeks of spectres &amp; phantasmagoria.\n\nThe story concerns the family of a retired general on trial for war crimes, and the unraveling they undergo after the arrival of a mysterious domestic help. There is a haunting quality to the way it is filmed, plus the horror aspects are finely utilised too yet it fails to immerse us completely into its world and never goes all-in with the retribution that was always coming which is a shame, for more could've been done here.\n\nOverall, La Llorona makes for a gripping story about the voids that never fill and scars that never heal, and also serves as a chilling metaphor of the blood-soaked history of Guatemala that's still crying for closure. Not a film for all and certainly not for those expecting something alone the lines of the terrible Hollywood take on the Latin American fable, this Guatemalan feature is a political drama pierced with thin lines of horror &amp; fantasy."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4735,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Although it is far from a straightforward genre film, its atmosphere still reeks of spectres &amp; phantasmagoria.\n\nThe story concerns the family of a retired general on trial for war crimes, and the unraveling they undergo after the arrival of a mysterious domestic help. There is a haunting quality to the way it is filmed, plus the horror aspects are finely utilised too yet it fails to immerse us completely into its world and never goes all-in with the retribution that was always coming which is a shame, for more could've been done here.\n\nOverall, La Llorona makes for a gripping story about the voids that never fill and scars that never heal, and also serves as a chilling metaphor of the blood-soaked history of Guatemala that's still crying for closure. Not a film for all and certainly not for those expecting something alone the lines of the terrible Hollywood take on the Latin American fable, this Guatemalan feature is a political drama pierced with thin lines of horror &amp; fantasy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4735,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And how many people admitted to tearing up or even crying while watching the show. I admit I have done the same.\n\nFrom the very beginning  no before that  From the moment I heard that Six Feet Under was created by Alan Ball, I knew I would like this show.  I figured how could the maker of American Beauty go wrong? Boy am I glad I figured that.\n\nTo some degree I can relate to all of the characters on the show. And that speaks volumes because all of the characters on the show are kinda messed up in the head. And that is what I think speaks to so many people. I mean before Donahue was the most popular show on TV, I don't think most Americans even knew the word dysfunctional' as applied to the family unit. Then it seemed a badge of honor to wear. And it was ok to go about telling people that you are from a dysfunctional family just to be in'. Now after all this time and openness about our dysfunction, we begin to see how very much alike we all are. And that I feel is one of the binding elements of the watchers to this program. We sit each week and watch, basically, a part of ourselves work through personal issues, prejudices and shortcomings. Not always pretty, not always successfully but always openly, to us, the viewers. For me, to watch these characters struggle through some of their problems (which usually make mine look like a day at the beach) and let us come along with them to learn about their weaknesses and fallibilities and humanness is a lot like therapy for me. And in the end it only costs the subscription rate for HBO (no, I don't work for them).\n\nI have never been that attached to the boob-tube (my father's word for the television) before. I have never had a reason to be. The programs that where on never more that mildly held my attention until now.  I HATE commercials, I think they speak down to the public. So now I have no excuses and for that I am grateful.\n\nBottom line: I'm looking forward to the next few sessions  uhm I mean seasons. That's my take, what's yours?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124677,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I admit I have done the same.\n\nFrom the very beginning  no before that  From the moment I heard that Six Feet Under was created by Alan Ball, I knew I would like this show.  I figured how could the maker of American Beauty go wrong? Boy am I glad I figured that.\n\nTo some degree I can relate to all of the characters on the show. And that speaks volumes because all of the characters on the show are kinda messed up in the head. And that is what I think speaks to so many people. I mean before Donahue was the most popular show on TV, I don't think most Americans even knew the word dysfunctional' as applied to the family unit. Then it seemed a badge of honor to wear. And it was ok to go about telling people that you are from a dysfunctional family just to be in'. Now after all this time and openness about our dysfunction, we begin to see how very much alike we all are. And that I feel is one of the binding elements of the watchers to this program. We sit each week and watch, basically, a part of ourselves work through personal issues, prejudices and shortcomings. Not always pretty, not always successfully but always openly, to us, the viewers. For me, to watch these characters struggle through some of their problems (which usually make mine look like a day at the beach) and let us come along with them to learn about their weaknesses and fallibilities and humanness is a lot like therapy for me. And in the end it only costs the subscription rate for HBO (no, I don't work for them).\n\nI have never been that attached to the boob-tube (my father's word for the television) before. I have never had a reason to be. The programs that where on never more that mildly held my attention until now.  I HATE commercials, I think they speak down to the public. So now I have no excuses and for that I am grateful.\n\nBottom line: I'm looking forward to the next few sessions  uhm I mean seasons. That's my take, what's yours?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124677,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Both start on an odd note but develop an endearing bond for the same purpose of finding their LOVED ones.\n\nOne thing leads to another, to reveal the suspense.\n\nThe script is very well written by Jean Luc Estebe with unusual plot twists and turns incorporated with relevant flashback stories of Martin and Adele.\n\nDirector Jacques Millot maintains a realistic look -unfolding complex human interactions and developing relationships between different characters while maintaining a countryside feel to the narrative.\n\nThe casting too is apt - Bernand as a remorseful father and Adele as a strong-willed, opinionated straight-talk daughter portray their characters with much ease. Gregory Montel's character is unlike what he has portrayed till date in his previous movies and he too does gritting justice to his role.\n\nThe good thing of the movie is that it does not fall into a typical cliche' sequence of events that we see in a psychological mystery-suspense thriller.\n\nThe movie had a good run in various European country telecast,\n\nI would go with 6.75 out of 10 for this Italian production","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-04-08","keywords":"based on true story","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494204/","name":"Bernard Le Coq","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1081257/","name":"Esther Garrel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2771436/","name":"Grégory Montel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537626/","name":"Jacques Maillot"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0125554/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0210887/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0627173/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0261548/","name":"Jean-Luc Estèbe"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And while I think thats true, I think its a bit more complex than that. It also is a bit of a coming of age story where Joe has to grow up and be the adult in this family, but also it seems that mom is having a mid-life crisis (although shes not quite mid-life) and trying to discover who she is outside of being the "perfect 50s housewife" that perhaps she feels trapped in. There's a lot of symbolism in this movie. The backdrop of this movie is that there is a wildfire that has been raging and the townspeople have been desperately trying to put out. And that correlates with Joe and his own family. Hes trying to put out the fire in his own family. Also, Joe works at photography studio and Paul Dano (the director and co-writer) even said that this is supposed to be a PORTRAIT of a family life. \n\nSpeaking of Paul Dano, I think he did well with his directorial debut. I think visually there are some gorgeous shots in this movie. Like for instance where Joe is watching the wildfires (and hes perfectly centered - probably again to mimic the portrait vibe). Also where Joe is about to give up but it starts to snow and hope has regained. I liked the film for the most part. They do frame the film by following Joe's perspective. And I think its mostly effective in making you feel for this kid, my only problem is there are a couple of parts where I feel like there are gaps in the story. Without giving too much away there is a scene where Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal) has decided to seek revenge and it ends up backfiring. And yet, the next time we see him everything seems to be fine. And it never really gets explained what happened. Theres a brief line that they decided it was a "misunderstanding" but you never really see what happened and he also gets hurt during this, and that never gets brought up again either. I know Paul and Zoe (the other writer) were adapting this from a book and perhaps thats the way it is in there too. But I personally found that a little frustrating. I needed a little more. \n\nCarey Mulligan is fantastic in this. She would be deserving to have her name thrown in the hat for awards season. I also thought Ed Oxenbould was a standout too. Which is good to hear since he's onscreen for pretty much most of the movie. I definitely will be looking forward to more of his things. I also thought Jake Gyllenhaal was good but hes absent for a good chunk of the film and so he just didnt stand out as much as Carey or Ed did.\n\nOverall I liked the film. It wasn't perfect, but I would totally check out another film that Paul Dano directs.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26616,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-01-01","keywords":"1960s,unemployment,photography,infidelity,firefighter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1986312985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A boy witnesses his parents' marriage falling apart after his mother finds another man."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590837/","name":"Ed Oxenbould"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0585931/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0564372/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625497/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1443740/","name":"Zoe Kazan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285840/","name":"Richard Ford"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It wasn't perfect, but I would totally check out another film that Paul Dano directs.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26616,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-01-01","keywords":"1960s,unemployment,photography,infidelity,firefighter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1986312985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A boy witnesses his parents' marriage falling apart after his mother finds another man.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590837/","name":"Ed Oxenbould","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0585931/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0564372/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625497/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1443740/","name":"Zoe Kazan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285840/","name":"Richard Ford"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.\n\nA fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender's portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.\n\nI was left speechless as the credits rolled.

So the Spacey film would have depicted events near the end of this film. Both are superb movies.\n\nBack to the review. This film is very unusual in that the producers have shown fierce determination in taking a serious topic and making it as user friendly as one possibly can. Multiple techniques are used to this end and they all work well. In fact in places the film has a Monty Python quality. Why was this done? One can only assume that the producers understood the multiple studies showing that the modern city-dweller becomes uncomfortable when confronted with any facts which suggest that he or she was not paying attention when bad things were happening. After all we live in a democracy so the voters should have been more alert? Isn't that their job? The techniques mentioned attempt to appeal to our SESAME STREET side and make the whole thing as pleasant an educational experience as possible. But make no mistake, this is an educational movie.\n\nOne that should be mandatory for adults. Like getting a driving test before a license. How about learning about Wall Street and the banks before you invest with them...? Carell steals the film and may finally get the attention he deserves. Great actor.\n\nFinally the message. The film suggests not only that Wall Street is corrupt but that the corruption extends to the agencies mandated to supervise Wall Street and (possibly) to Washington itself. The implicit message, conveyed in the end credits, that unless we deal with the problem at the source the symptoms will keep happening over and over and over.\n\nDuh!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":386439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-12-23","keywords":"mortgage,finance,bank,banking,short selling","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1593618969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI1NDY1MTY1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg1OTIzNzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI1NDY1MTY1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg1OTIzNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When four outsiders saw what the big banks, media and government refused to, the global collapse of the economy, they had an idea:  The Big Short.

So the Spacey film would have depicted events near the end of this film. Both are superb movies.\n\nBack to the review. This film is very unusual in that the producers have shown fierce determination in taking a serious topic and making it as user friendly as one possibly can. Multiple techniques are used to this end and they all work well. In fact in places the film has a Monty Python quality. Why was this done? One can only assume that the producers understood the multiple studies showing that the modern city-dweller becomes uncomfortable when confronted with any facts which suggest that he or she was not paying attention when bad things were happening. After all we live in a democracy so the voters should have been more alert? Isn't that their job? The techniques mentioned attempt to appeal to our SESAME STREET side and make the whole thing as pleasant an educational experience as possible. But make no mistake, this is an educational movie.\n\nOne that should be mandatory for adults. Like getting a driving test before a license. How about learning about Wall Street and the banks before you invest with them...? Carell steals the film and may finally get the attention he deserves. Great actor.\n\nFinally the message. The film suggests not only that Wall Street is corrupt but that the corruption extends to the agencies mandated to supervise Wall Street and (possibly) to Washington itself. The implicit message, conveyed in the end credits, that unless we deal with the problem at the source the symptoms will keep happening over and over and over.\n\nDuh!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":386439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-12-23","keywords":"mortgage,finance,bank,banking,short selling","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1593618969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI1NDY1MTY1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg1OTIzNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI1NDY1MTY1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg1OTIzNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When four outsiders saw what the big banks, media and government refused to, the global collapse of the economy, they had an idea:  The Big Short.

Was Olivier Assayas drunk and/or high when he put this together? It's a complicated slog of a film that is dull and boring and makes no sense, that the 127 min runtime felt like 5 hours. And the ending felt like they used up the budget lol. The only redeeming qualities was that the acting was on point, the landscapes beautiful, the sound and score decent, and the cinematography was excellent, and that's where my very generous 5/10 rating goes towards. Such a shame on the lost potential had a better director and screenwriter been hired instead of Assayas.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9263,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-01-29","keywords":"written by director,communism,cigar smoking,spy,cuba","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1948368409","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhkNzY0MGEtMmJjZC00Yzc2LTg5ZDAtMTc2OGUxNjAyZmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhkNzY0MGEtMmJjZC00Yzc2LTg5ZDAtMTc2OGUxNjAyZmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on a true and gripping story: Cuban spies infiltrate exile groups in the 1990s to stop terrorism against the island, but at a high personal cost.

It is a slapstick-heavy family movie that should delight young children and keep parents entertained.\n\nThe Croods are the last remaining family in an arid desert landscape. They have survived by following family patriarch Grug's (Nicolas Cage) rules to the letter, including staying in the cave after dark and fearing anything that seems new (new is BAAAD). Despite this, teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) wants to break free and rebels against her father, which results in a chance meeting with the highly inventive Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who warns her that the end of the world is nigh. When the Croods' cave is destroyed, the family is forced on a journey into a strange new world where Grug's rules clash with Guy's techniques for survival.\n\nThe Croods is a formulaic movie that sticks to a traditional hero's journey and relies on typical archetypes, but it's elevated by the writing and direction of Kirk DeMicco and How to Train Your Dragon's Chris Sanders. Like Sanders' previous work, The Croods focuses on a family's dynamic and relationships. This time, the focus is on a protective father who wants to protect his family physically and protect his daughter from a member of the opposite sex who suddenly challenges his position as the alpha male. While the trailers and first half of the movie made is seem Eep was the main character, it's actually Grug who goes through the greatest change and learns the biggest lessons.\n\nThe story is one about learning, exploring, and using one's intelligence. It also touches on the idea that it's unhealthy to live a sheltered life. But at times, the movie lays it on a bit too much with Guy and his "solutions" leaving Grug on the losing end.\n\nMost of the humour used in The Croods is very physical and slapstick oriented. Characters have Loony Toons levels of invincibility as they endure intense physical pain. This type of humour obviously appeals to fairly young children, but I would be lying if I said I did not laugh at the film at all. The Croods avoids using crude toilet humour to generate cheap laughs. There is not much in the way of verbal humour, but there are some running gags, and modernisms are kept to a minimum. They are still there but they are more putting modern products in a Stone Age setting, a little like The Flintstones, so they serve more as pop-cultural winks to adults.\n\nAs expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. It's quick and fluid, and the camera flows nicely as it follows the action. The Croods themselves have a seemingly unpleasant, bulky design to them but it actually works in the context of the film because the characters live in the wild, so big and broad makes sense. It is a little refreshing to see the main female character is not made out to be a stunning beauty, but rather someone who has been shaped by her environment. The beginning of the movie starts with in dry, mono-coloured landscapes before we get to see the bright colours of the jungle and continually seeing the weird creature reminiscence of designs of Sanders' previous works.\n\nLike other animated movies these days, The Croods has a big name voice cast and they also do a decent, if standard job. No one disgraces themselves. Cage is an unusual choice, but he gives a strong performance. There is only one time when Cage is let off the handle; Unfortunately, that is when we are experiencing the most modernism the movie has to offer.\n\nThe Croods is not going to match the heights of DreamsWorks major hits of Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon. But it certainly does not belong with the dregs the studio has to offer. It does what it sets out to do: make a movie that will please children while attempting to give a positive message and some heart. It has an old-fashioned sense of humour that leads to a surprisingly enjoyable animated movie.\n\nPlease visit www.entertainmentfuse.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201412,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"caveman,journey,cave,survival,strict father","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi126265113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The world's very first prehistoric family goes on a road trip to an uncharted and fantastical world."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000092/","name":"John Cleese"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Stine, but accidentally bring every  monster he created for his horror series to life.  A wholly original tale featuring elements from every Goosebumps book  and TV episode, this awesome adaptation benefits greatly from Black's  maniacal performance, as well as its spunky script and first-rate  effects.  However, if everything they wrote materialized authors would just write  about licensed theme parks.

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished. Now, imagine yourself stationed in space and just try to keep your heartrate below 80!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206553,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished. Now, imagine yourself stationed in space and just try to keep your heartrate below 80!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206553,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The detectives are:\n\nFrançoise Galliot(played by Clotilde de Bayser)(season 1;2;3;4) is the chief of the team. She is a very authoritative woman. She is a good friend of Scandella.\n\nHélène Vallon(played by Isabel Otéro)(season 5;6;7;8;9) is the second chief of the team after Galliot's departure.\n\nJean-Louis Scandella(played by Didier Cauchy): He is a good friend of Paulo and Françoise, and he felt in love with Caroline, and after with Vallon the 2nd chief. He become the new chief after Vallons 'departure.\n\nMichel Lemarchand(played by Jean-François Garreaud): A very mystery man.\n\nPaul "Paulo" Maureau(played by Teco Celio): The best friend of Scandella\n\nAlexandre "Sisko" Siskowski(played by Dominique Guillo): A young detective.\n\nCaroline Tessier(played by Agathe de La Boulaye)(episodes 1-13). She was in love with Scandella but she was murdered.\n\nAnd more... I think the show was good during the 9 first seasons when Galliot, and after Vallon, was the chief of team. After that Hélène Vallon left the team, the show was not as much so good.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"genre":["Crime"],"datePublished":"1999-06-11","keywords":"paris france,quai des orfevres,investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308036/","name":"Jean-François Garreaud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0146447/","name":"Didier Cauchy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0347123/","name":"Dominique Guillo"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074460/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The detectives are:\n\nFrançoise Galliot(played by Clotilde de Bayser)(season 1;2;3;4) is the chief of the team. She is a very authoritative woman. She is a good friend of Scandella.\n\nHélène Vallon(played by Isabel Otéro)(season 5;6;7;8;9) is the second chief of the team after Galliot's departure.\n\nJean-Louis Scandella(played by Didier Cauchy): He is a good friend of Paulo and Françoise, and he felt in love with Caroline, and after with Vallon the 2nd chief. He become the new chief after Vallons 'departure.\n\nMichel Lemarchand(played by Jean-François Garreaud): A very mystery man.\n\nPaul "Paulo" Maureau(played by Teco Celio): The best friend of Scandella\n\nAlexandre "Sisko" Siskowski(played by Dominique Guillo): A young detective.\n\nCaroline Tessier(played by Agathe de La Boulaye)(episodes 1-13). She was in love with Scandella but she was murdered.\n\nAnd more... I think the show was good during the 9 first seasons when Galliot, and after Vallon, was the chief of team. After that Hélène Vallon left the team, the show was not as much so good.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"genre":["Crime"],"datePublished":"1999-06-11","keywords":"paris france,quai des orfevres,investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308036/","name":"Jean-François Garreaud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0146447/","name":"Didier Cauchy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0347123/","name":"Dominique Guillo"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074460/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even if the feeling isn't always a politically correct one.McCoy,Briscoe,Logan,and Schiff will always be my favorites.Their comments were always the best and face it Briscoe and Schiff could be hilarious at times.Hopefully the writing will stay interesting and the characters rich.So far this show has managed to skirt being to redundant.Which is a big feat for a show that's been on 15 years.Here's to many more years of a great show.

Jerry Orbach is great as Lennie, and I was stunned to learn that he also played the voice of Lumiere, the French candlestick in Beauty and the Beast! His sarcastic one-liners never fail to get me laughing, and he and his new partner, Jesse L. Martin as Ed Green, have a good rapport and are believable as partners. On the "Order" side, Sam Waterston, Dianne Wiest, and Elisabeth Rohm are equally compelling. New cast member Rohm has gotten better as she's gone along; she had big shoes to fill as Angie Harmon's replacement. Because the stories are all driven by the plots, and not the characters' personal lives, it makes the constant cast turnover more believable. It's a testament to Dick Wolf and co. that such a smart, sharp show has stayed on the edge after almost 12 years! My only beef is I'm tired of hearing "Ripped from the headlines" in every promo. That, though, is a minor quibble. Wednesday nights wouldn't be the same without it!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1990-09-13","keywords":"shared universe,copaganda,profanity,ampersand in title,punctuation in title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001583/","name":"Jerry Orbach","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0552509/","name":"Jesse L.

That being said, no one makes better mysteries than the British, and the "Inspector Lewis" series is proof positive of that. Kevin Whately is a stand-out as the eponymous character, a diligent yet sympathetic policeman who wears his middle-class background as proudly as he does his badge. It's nice to see Whately taking the helm in this series as it's lead after playing the wingman in the "Inspector Morse" shows for so long. He doesn't try to assume the John Thaw role but instead keeps this character all his own. James Fox is the perfect fit as his younger, book-smart partner Hathaway, a dude who can quote just about anything from anywhere, thanks in part to his scholarly background in Theology. These two guys have a very believable chemistry as police partners who work with each other's strengths (Lewis has the hunches it seems and Hathaway has his logic) to solve the multiple mysteries that crop up in the college town in Oxfordshire where they toil. The mysteries presented in the show are never too easy to figure out, giving you just enough clues to try to follow along. Often times it's a really cool surprise when the who-dun-it is solved at the end. I also want to add that, in addition to a great cast, great writing and so forth, they don't flog you with loud obvious music throughout that gives too much away (though yes, there is SOME music and it's quite nice actually). I'm a fan of this show and I hope they keep this series with it's fantastic cast going for a long time to come.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11445,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-01-29","keywords":"sequel,buddy,buddy cop,character name as series title,oxfordshire england","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0923610/","name":"Kevin Whately"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0289114/","name":"Laurence Fox"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0391600/","name":"Clare Holman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041014/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103289/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0178626/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inspector Lewis: The Point Of Vanishing","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1294056473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgwZjZjMTUtYzEwYi00OTc5LWE0MmMtNWQ4ZmJhNWM5MWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgwZjZjMTUtYzEwYi00OTc5LWE0MmMtNWQ4ZmJhNWM5MWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspector Lewis: The Point Of Vanishing"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That being said, no one makes better mysteries than the British, and the "Inspector Lewis" series is proof positive of that. Kevin Whately is a stand-out as the eponymous character, a diligent yet sympathetic policeman who wears his middle-class background as proudly as he does his badge. It's nice to see Whately taking the helm in this series as it's lead after playing the wingman in the "Inspector Morse" shows for so long. He doesn't try to assume the John Thaw role but instead keeps this character all his own. James Fox is the perfect fit as his younger, book-smart partner Hathaway, a dude who can quote just about anything from anywhere, thanks in part to his scholarly background in Theology. These two guys have a very believable chemistry as police partners who work with each other's strengths (Lewis has the hunches it seems and Hathaway has his logic) to solve the multiple mysteries that crop up in the college town in Oxfordshire where they toil. The mysteries presented in the show are never too easy to figure out, giving you just enough clues to try to follow along. Often times it's a really cool surprise when the who-dun-it is solved at the end. I also want to add that, in addition to a great cast, great writing and so forth, they don't flog you with loud obvious music throughout that gives too much away (though yes, there is SOME music and it's quite nice actually). I'm a fan of this show and I hope they keep this series with it's fantastic cast going for a long time to come.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11445,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-01-29","keywords":"sequel,buddy,buddy cop,character name as series title,oxfordshire england","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0923610/","name":"Kevin Whately","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0289114/","name":"Laurence Fox","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0391600/","name":"Clare Holman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041014/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103289/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0178626/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inspector Lewis: The Point Of Vanishing","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1294056473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgwZjZjMTUtYzEwYi00OTc5LWE0MmMtNWQ4ZmJhNWM5MWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzgwZjZjMTUtYzEwYi00OTc5LWE0MmMtNWQ4ZmJhNWM5MWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspector Lewis: The Point Of Vanishing"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I initially get excited to see one of my favorite series on the big screen, and eventually walk away disgusted. For whatever reason, most shows and movies that are based on epic book series absolutely butcher the original content. \n\nSo when I saw the preview for "Game of Thrones" on HBO, I was immediately skeptical. Oh, I was going to watch it, but I didn't have high expectations. I did hold a little hope because HBO is known for their high quality shows. \n\nI was absolutely shocked to watch the Pilot and realize that it followed the book almost to perfection. The language that is used by the actors is very similar to the way that it was written in the book, and events were not skipped. It stayed very true to the story without adding to it or removing from it. \n\nThe acting is superb and I actually felt like I was looking into Winterfell for the first time. I feel like I've actually got faces to add to the characters that I've been reading about for a long time. \n\nIf you have not read the books, you may feel as though the blatant sexuality is an addition from HBO to add some spice to the series. This is not the case at all. The books contained all of the sexuality that is shown in the Pilot. I am very proud of HBO for producing an amazingly accurate product. I will be watching every week for sure. \n\nIf you enjoyed what you saw in the Pilot, know that there are many other plot twists and action filled evenings to come. "Game of Thrones" has a ton of potential to be one of the greatest series that has ever been produced. I would highly recommend it to fans of the series and newcomers alike.\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI have now watched 3 Episodes and I wanted to come back and report some more. Even after 3 Episodes, the series is staying true to the written story. Overall the acting is still very good. I hate to watch a show that makes it look like the actors are reading a script. I don't get this impression with this HBO adaptation. \n\nEach episode of this series leaves me itching for the next weekend. I really hate watching shows in real time because I enjoy absorbing several hours of a show at one time. But, a good show will keep you looking forward to it the whole week. \n\nA special note to viewers that have not read the books... Keep watching! This series has numerous twists and turns and full of epic battles and action. It may seem like it's taking a little while to develop, but the reward is well worth the wait. \n\nEven after 3 episodes, I would still highly recommend this to anyone.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1862576,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":9.2,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2011-04-17","keywords":"based on novel,dragon,politics,nudity,queen","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3592338/","name":"Emilia Clarke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0227759/","name":"Peter Dinklage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3229685/","name":"Kit Harington"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0335036/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167350/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1125275/","name":"David Benioff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1888967/","name":"D.B.

I'm not a big fan of subtitled series, but I found the lead role's mohawk haircut interesting enough to keep me tuned in for longer than usual. The rest is history. Once you start watching Gennnaro Savastano (played by Salvatore Esposito) you will be addicted. The macho man of all macho men, he looks like he could burst you with one right hook. As if one magnetic actor wasn't enough, along comes Salvatore Conte (played by Marco Palvetti), a suave slickster with an instantly addictive accent and way of expressing himself. The action is constantly moving at perfect pace, the settings are beautifully contrasted. Everything about this series is brilliant, even the bit-part players are magnetic, one such character brilliantly named Tonino Spiderman. This is a must-own series for all gangster movie/TV series buffs, and the great thing about it is, not a lot of people know just how mind-blowingly brilliant it is.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32094,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS films are an example of an "A" in this category. Last year's GEOSTORM was a "B" (it was so over-the-top that it was fun, especially when the meteorologist declared - as if he was reciting Shakespeare - "Oh my God, it's a GEOSTORM!"). Unfortunately, a "C" example of this is THE HURRICANE HEIST.\n\nDirected by Rob Cohen - who brought us the original FAST AND FURIOUS film lo' those many years ago - THE HURRICANE HEIST tells the tale of a HEIST set during a...anyone?...HURRICANE.

What do these good guys have in common? They are not hard to look at on the screen. The two men also have really bad Southern accents.\n\nThe bad guys are led by Ralph Ineson ( a perennial "that guy" in such films as STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE) and a host of "red shirts". The problem is that Ineson plays his bad guy role as a "that guy" and the "red shirts" have no personality at all. One guy tries to be the "loose cannon" but he doesn't go far enough, nor does Ineson or ANY of the bad guys.\n\nOh...did I mention Ben Cross (Sarek in the new STAR TREK films)? Cross leaped off the screen in the Oscar winning film CHARIOTS OF FIRE way back in 1981 and was going to be "the next big thing". How has that worked out for him? I'm sure he's making a nice living, but...\n\nBut...you don't come to this kind of films for the acting.

Last year's GEOSTORM was a "B" (it was so over-the-top that it was fun, especially when the meteorologist declared - as if he was reciting Shakespeare - "Oh my God, it's a GEOSTORM!").

What do these good guys have in common? They are not hard to look at on the screen. The two men also have really bad Southern accents.\n\nThe bad guys are led by Ralph Ineson ( a perennial "that guy" in such films as STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE) and a host of "red shirts". The problem is that Ineson plays his bad guy role as a "that guy" and the "red shirts" have no personality at all. One guy tries to be the "loose cannon" but he doesn't go far enough, nor does Ineson or ANY of the bad guys.\n\nOh...did I mention Ben Cross (Sarek in the new STAR TREK films)? Cross leaped off the screen in the Oscar winning film CHARIOTS OF FIRE way back in 1981 and was going to be "the next big thing". How has that worked out for him? I'm sure he's making a nice living, but...\n\nBut...you don't come to this kind of films for the acting.

His first super-hero project, 'Kick Ass,' opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film's ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with 'X-Men: First Class,' an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.\n\nSet within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960's, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him. But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity as a whole.\n\nInstantly where 'X-Men: First Class' works is in regards to its two central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward. Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes, Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race, his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it's this development which drives the plot forward.\n\nAside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960's X-Men universe. With a modest running time at two hours and ten minutes, there are more than a few well-choreographed action sequences that would adequately satisfy any of comic-book-to-film aficionado's wishing to see this film. Each character's power or ability is at some point represented in a destructive or defensive capacity, taking full advantage of the fact that while many super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature of the artillery characters can be seen to withstand from governmental agencies or blindsided human opponents, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that human reaction would be futile due to the overwhelming power the mutants possess. These scenes also allow the less important characters to show their physical presence on-screen. For example, during the climactic fight sequence at the conclusion of the film, every mutant character that is identified to the audience is finally shown using their abilities to full capacity, most notably the henchmen of Shaw and the rag-tag team of Xavier and Lehnsherr. This therefore accounts slightly for the lack of depth that has been attempted in these secondary characters due to the time and story constraints.\n\nWhile it is a very good and accessible comic-book/super-hero movie, 'X-Men' does also contain two central flaws. The first is superseded in a way by the strength of both McAvoy and Fassbenders performances, as Kevin Bacon is constantly overshadowed as the one-dimensional antagonist of the piece. His plot to ultimately destroy humanity becomes second fiddle to the ever intricate complex relationship between Xavier and Lehnsherr, and his appearance seems too modelled upon that of a James Bond villain. He has the slick hair, the beautiful women and the villainous underground Club to boot, but Bacon unfortunately doesn't have the charisma to be accepted as a worthy opponent to the protagonists. The other flaw has to do with a minor aspect of the production itself, as the non-diegetic music, most notably during the action sequences, begins to diminish in its impact as the film carries on, leading to it eventually becoming the generic, genre-related fanfare associated with the conventional comic-book films.\n\n'X-Men: First Class,' is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film's core instead of the action-set-pieces taking place, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience members.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":655044,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

They behave just like anyone else would in that situation, and they're likable enough and believable enough to make us root for them.  I didn't find myself feeling much sympathy for the rest of the cast (they often act like typical slasher movie fodder, especially the two kids who get high and have sex shortly before being murdered), but they're at least more believable than the characters who usually appear in these movies.\n\nOverall, I would have to say that this movie was better than most of the horror movies that have come out lately.

He is mysteriously revived and is given another mission that lasts for 24 hours.\n\nI keep thinking there is something wrong with this film, but I can't pinpoint what it is. Maybe it's because of the absurdity of reviving someone for 24 hours. Why try and succeed in the mission, when you'll die in 24 hours regardless of success or failure? Another thing is that there seems to be a lot of movie logic present. Why use an office that is completely exposed to being shot, when you're interviewing a high value target? The story doesn't make much sense.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13515,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His first super-hero project, 'Kick Ass,' opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film's ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with 'X-Men: First Class,' an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.\n\nSet within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960's, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him. But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity as a whole.\n\nInstantly where 'X-Men: First Class' works is in regards to its two central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward. Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes, Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race, his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it's this development which drives the plot forward.\n\nAside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960's X-Men universe. With a modest running time at two hours and ten minutes, there are more than a few well-choreographed action sequences that would adequately satisfy any of comic-book-to-film aficionado's wishing to see this film. Each character's power or ability is at some point represented in a destructive or defensive capacity, taking full advantage of the fact that while many super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature of the artillery characters can be seen to withstand from governmental agencies or blindsided human opponents, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that human reaction would be futile due to the overwhelming power the mutants possess. These scenes also allow the less important characters to show their physical presence on-screen. For example, during the climactic fight sequence at the conclusion of the film, every mutant character that is identified to the audience is finally shown using their abilities to full capacity, most notably the henchmen of Shaw and the rag-tag team of Xavier and Lehnsherr. This therefore accounts slightly for the lack of depth that has been attempted in these secondary characters due to the time and story constraints.\n\nWhile it is a very good and accessible comic-book/super-hero movie, 'X-Men' does also contain two central flaws. The first is superseded in a way by the strength of both McAvoy and Fassbenders performances, as Kevin Bacon is constantly overshadowed as the one-dimensional antagonist of the piece. His plot to ultimately destroy humanity becomes second fiddle to the ever intricate complex relationship between Xavier and Lehnsherr, and his appearance seems too modelled upon that of a James Bond villain. He has the slick hair, the beautiful women and the villainous underground Club to boot, but Bacon unfortunately doesn't have the charisma to be accepted as a worthy opponent to the protagonists. The other flaw has to do with a minor aspect of the production itself, as the non-diegetic music, most notably during the action sequences, begins to diminish in its impact as the film carries on, leading to it eventually becoming the generic, genre-related fanfare associated with the conventional comic-book films.\n\n'X-Men: First Class,' is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film's core instead of the action-set-pieces taking place, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience members.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":655044,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Maybe it's because of the absurdity of reviving someone for 24 hours. Why try and succeed in the mission, when you'll die in 24 hours regardless of success or failure? Another thing is that there seems to be a lot of movie logic present. Why use an office that is completely exposed to being shot, when you're interviewing a high value target? The story doesn't make much sense.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13515,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His relationship with the young Dalai Lama (a very impressive actor) is an unusual one and refreshingly unsentimental.

It could be argued that this film has a Western perspective, but after all, it is adapted from a book written by a European living in Tibet, and intended for Western audiences. It treats the Tibetan culture with a great deal of respect, so I don't really see a problem with that. Similarly, those who have complained that it doesn't tell you enough about the Dalai Lama and too much about Heinrich, ultimately it is Heinrich's story, and that is its strength: that it is one man's tale, and not a political polemic. It gives you a great sense of how people's stories intersect and how the whole world is connected.\n\nOverall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":133769,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Hollywood's golden girl teams up with man of the moment Sean Penn in this well-paced and intense tale which unfolds against a backdrop of international terror and unashamedly draws parallels with the current political situation in Zimbabwe. Kidman adopts a satisfactory South African accent for the role of Silvia Broome, a UN interpreter who overhears a plot to assassinate a controversial African leader during his visit to the United States. Penn is Tobin Keller, a Secret Service agent assigned to investigate Silvia's claims and protect her from the assassins. But is Silvia telling the truth? Silvia's life is turned upside down as she becomes a target for the killers but a suspicious Kellar digs deeper into her past in a bid to find out what she is hiding. Pollack (who has a small part in the movie) scored a massive coup when he convinced Kofi Annan to allow filming inside the UN building for the first time. Even Alfred Hitchcock had to improvise when making the classic Cary Grant North By North West. The movie has some very strong opening scenes, shot on location in South Africa, and instantly grabs our attention. When the action moves to New York, Pollack (who brought us Tootsie, Out Of Africa and The Firm) creates an old-whorled vibe with grainy shots more reminiscent of the 70s, deliberately avoiding the neon lights of the Big Apple to create a dulled-down mood that sits much better with the film's content. Kidman and Penn handle their material well, putting in solid performances and the pair square up nicely on screen. Predictably, and annoyingly so, however, a chemistry develops between the two making for some scenes which would have been better left on the cutting room floor. Let's face it, the old adage of two strangers being brought together by circumstance and suddenly being able to open up and shed their baggage has all been done before. The moral of the story is also a little bit too Hollywood. We can admire its good intentions and even buy into the idea that we can change the world with words and diplomacy but it all becomes a bit nonsensical. But it is the movies after all and it's difficult to find fault with Pollack who has opted for a dialect-driven film as opposed to high-octane action scenes - although they do make a welcome appearance as the film reaches its climax. This is the thinking person's thriller and it's definitely worth a viewing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":102574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-04-20","keywords":"driving,assassination,interpreter,threat,intrigue","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Interpreter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1945370905","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MDhmN2EtNzU1OC00M2U5LWFhZDktMjg4OWQzNDBiMTg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MDhmN2EtNzU1OC00M2U5LWFhZDktMjg4OWQzNDBiMTg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001416/","name":"Catherine Keener"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001628/","name":"Sydney Pollack"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826369/","name":"Martin Stellman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911422/","name":"Brian Ward"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1017488/","name":"Charles Randolph"}],"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Films like "Children of Men", "Looper", and "The Road" have greatly contributed to this sub-genre which, in reality, is not really new, but is constantly being redefined and given different treatments : "Children of Men" was an ode to life, "Looper" felt a lot like a modern-day western, "The Road" was a classic tale of a father-and-son relationship, and now, "Elysium", a thriller/action film/social commentary about disparity between the rich and the poor. Neill Blomkamp burst out of the scene in 2009 with "District 9", a very similar project in several regards, and blew audiences away with a clever mix of documentary-style filmmaking, explosive action, and the refreshing implement of an obvious social commentary.\n\n"Elysium" starts off brilliantly, showcasing two opposite environments: the old Earth, which has turned into a huge ghetto where people live like cattle, and Elysium, a high-end space station where all the wealthy people from Earth have moved to establish their home. We are then introduced to our protagonist, Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), whose quest is quickly defined after being exposed to deadly radiation : With five days left to live, Max will ally up with a group of illegal immigrants to get to Elysium so he can get the proper medical attention he needs. But Secretary Rhodes (Jodie Foster), an evil government executive in charge of defending Elysium, will stand in his way, by hiring Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a psychopathic mercenary in charge of neutralizing all illegal immigrants.\n\nThe first third of "Elysium" is both fascinating and stressful : You are being introduced to the over-populated Earth, its hospitals, its industrial plants, its streets. These images are very reminiscent of the Johannesburg ghettos depicted in "District 9". And then, you get to see glimpses of the wonderful Elysium, a visual tour-de-force that ends up being shamefully underused in the film. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation, the film jumps into a nerve-racking tone, and it is very effective, as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common.\n\nUnfortunately, the pace slows down in the second third, where Max's story gets sidelined a bit, to the profit of a few sub-plots that involve an unpredictable, yet not so major twist in terms of impact on the story, as well as a sub-story involving the daughter of an old friend of Max. And while the twist is a welcome addition, the sub-story comes a little out of nowhere and comes off as a bit of a cliché. It seemed like Blomkamp was trying to preserve this family theme that was dear to him in "District 9", and that served the story so well in his previous film. Its unusual aspect prevented it from being too clichéd (an alien dad and his alien son), which is unfortunately not the case in "Elysium". It does not ruin the film, but it does steal its share of precious screen time in a film that feels a tad too short, and leads it towards more conventional developments.\n\nThen the pace picks up again, with a third act that consists mostly of a bunch of pretty awesome action/fighting sequences, where the feeling of urgency from the original quest has pretty much left the building. In terms of writing, this is conventional stuff, but the technical expertise behind the visuals and the sound is a thing of beauty. Also, the dramatic elements displayed in the first third are briefly brought back to seal the deal, and do provide a satisfying feeling of closure to the story.\n\nOverall, this is quality entertainment with impressive visuals, and a world of ideas that had infinite potential. And while "Elysium" exploited only a fraction of its potential, what it did exploit it did it successfully. Directing, photography, music, and performances are all superb. With a decent yet a bit unoriginal social commentary in the background that does get shelved in the second half to the profit of rock-solid action sequences, the strengths of "Elysium", taken individually, do feel a bit scattered, but make for an overall very competent package.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":424635,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.\n\nAnd one final note. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard.

Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is "Little Miss Sunshine", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.\n\nThe title stems from a beauty pageant in which seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin of "Signs") competes. For a good portion of the film, the contest serves as a MacGuffin of sorts, putting an already odd mix of family members on the road in bizarre situations that call Vegas Vacation to mind.\n\nBut "Sunshine" is far more than the slapstick of "Vacation".

It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.\n\nRather crude at times, "Sunshine" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.\n\nBottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":451870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"beauty pageant,cross country trip,gay,drugs,graduate student","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Little Miss Sunshine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3667263769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001057/","name":"Toni Collette"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206760/","name":"Jonathan Dayton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267512/","name":"Valerie Faris"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148020/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063938/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1578335/","name":"Michael Arndt"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I am surprised that it has received such poor reviews from the critics. I have noticed they tend to rate realistic, depressing films; whereas we like happy escapist fun and this film delivers that. \n\nWe are from the UK and the voices are perhaps better known here, which may have contributed, a little, to our perception of this film's charm.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55124,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Bella reveals that she and her husband discovered they cannot have children. I like that she also dares make a complaint about "sitting in this damn chair".

There was Bella left waving goodbye from her Quickie. No, wait a minute. This was not to be. They wanted Bella with them; she belonged with them on this mission. There were no complicated maneuvers of how will we squeeze her into the car, what will we do with the wheelchair, no exasperation from the characters. They just did it. They made it happen.

A story that is about the child within each of us, yet all the while considering the risks involved during the whole of life. This is a story about innocence, in the true meaning of "knowing oneself completely" and all that this implies. It is also a story very much about the importance of imagination and creativity.\n\nI am a child and an adult. What I've been taught, not entirely by just my fellow human beings, is that judgment is never productive. At its best, it is a desire to share with others something we do or do not appreciate. At its worst, it is a shutting down of the connection we have with each other. Perhaps a more productive way of sharing opinions about anything might be making distinctions between what is appreciated about the thing, and what is not, and the reasons for both aspects of these thoughts/feelings. This story actually addresses this tough issue, while entertaining us with a romp and a grand adventure.\n\nMy appreciation of this film is that it inspires me to laugh at myself (it's quite funny), at us, and my culture. And all the while, it is kind. The story and animation are tremendously imaginative, a quality I've found missing in many stories, animated or not. One of the themes, if not the main thread of the story, is that we humans are creative beings, and that, while this involves risks, we must express our imagination or take the greater risk of becoming stuck, stale and static, living only in the past tense.\n\nThe greatest compliment I can give this film is that I want my 2-year-old granddaughter to see it, for I am absolutely sure she will enjoy it almost as much as I have at age 61.\n\nGreg Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":211646,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A story that is about the child within each of us, yet all the while considering the risks involved during the whole of life. This is a story about innocence, in the true meaning of "knowing oneself completely" and all that this implies. It is also a story very much about the importance of imagination and creativity.\n\nI am a child and an adult. What I've been taught, not entirely by just my fellow human beings, is that judgment is never productive. At its best, it is a desire to share with others something we do or do not appreciate. At its worst, it is a shutting down of the connection we have with each other. Perhaps a more productive way of sharing opinions about anything might be making distinctions between what is appreciated about the thing, and what is not, and the reasons for both aspects of these thoughts/feelings. This story actually addresses this tough issue, while entertaining us with a romp and a grand adventure.\n\nMy appreciation of this film is that it inspires me to laugh at myself (it's quite funny), at us, and my culture. And all the while, it is kind. The story and animation are tremendously imaginative, a quality I've found missing in many stories, animated or not. One of the themes, if not the main thread of the story, is that we humans are creative beings, and that, while this involves risks, we must express our imagination or take the greater risk of becoming stuck, stale and static, living only in the past tense.\n\nThe greatest compliment I can give this film is that I want my 2-year-old granddaughter to see it, for I am absolutely sure she will enjoy it almost as much as I have at age 61.\n\nGreg Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":211646,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is nothing like that.\n\nJack Black's Gulliver starts out in the real world of the present day, with a smart phone. That's all you really need to know about when this took place. \n\nHe's not happy with his life in the mail room, and he wants more. A relationship with travel writer Darcy, and more opportunities to do the real work of the New York Tribune.\n\nThe Internet makes things easy. When I was in high school and college, there was plagiarism, but it was more challenging because what we know today as the Internet didn't exist. Gulliver has an easy time impressing Darcy and gets sent to the Bermuda Triangle. Oh, so this is how it will work. \n\nAnd it's actually a pretty exciting scene as Gulliver gets sent into another dimension. Then he has the experience that Danson had, only funnier. This version of the story, pretty much limited to Lilliput, will go for laughs.\n\nAnd Lilliput is quite a complete nation, but with very small people compared to Gulliver. The castle where the royal family lives is huge. There is a city with lots of people, with varying ethnic backgrounds, and a countryside outside that city. And the Lilliputians have wars against other very small people from other nations.\n\nOnly after Gulliver shows his value in fighting a war is he treated with respect. He is a hero. And then things get quite silly. Every movie Gulliver has ever seen becomes a detail of his life, and pop culture references show up in abundance. We later see a giant R2D2 from "Star Wars", combined with "Transformers", used in battle, for example. All because Gulliver's plans for a video game become a fighting robot.\n\nMeanwhile, the prisoner Horatio vies with the nasty Edward for the heart of Princess Mary. Horatio is released only because Gulliver is his friend. \n\nThere is one scene where Mary is kidnapped, and I'm not sure whether it is atrocious writing or atrocious acting. No, it's actually brilliant writing and good acting, because most of the acting in this movie is quite good. I mean for the material. It takes real effort to make the acting look really bad. \n\nI am curious about one thing. Of course Gulliver loses cell phone service when he gets close to the Bermuda Triangle. How then is it possible he can receive the voice mails he missed--AFTER he crosses over? And these voice mails are quite important--if you think about it, there's an interesting plot twist coming. \n\nThe battle scenes are pretty impressive. I watch several CW super hero shows, and it's a lot like that. Even Horatio gets involved. \n\nThere is one cute scene in the world where everyone is big. It only has a little girl, who is quite big compared to Gulliver. Imagine what she would look like to Lilliputians. \n\nAnd the movie has a big musical number which is quite well done. Again, it seems silly to have the entire cast performing a song Gulliver likes. Also, the music here is quite old compared to, say, a romantic comedy starring teenagers. It comes closer to what I like. Let's say that.\n\nNo, it doesn't rank as the most impressive of the productions based on the literary work. No, it is not literary work on its own. But it is enjoyable and somewhat well done.

But first, he plays around with his new found menacing powers.\n\n Calling the mask a hero is like calling Hitler kind of a good guy. The mask makes Stanley rob banks, scare people and more. He's half-hero.\n\n "The Mask" is not great, but it fits Carrey's film persona quite well. He bounces off the wall (literally) and just doesn't sit still. Typical Carrey.\n\n If you're not one for loser-to-hero films or wacky slapstick, don't see "The Mask". Otherwise, it's worth a peek.\n\n3/5 stars","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356166,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For the most part it's a miss, we RARELY have a funny or original romantic comedy. It's been over a year since we've had a good romantic comedy and this year seems to be pushing the horrible movies of this genre. For example, we had The Proposal that was released this year and it was just awful and so simple. The Ugly Truth seemed to be heading the same way when I first saw the trailer, but when I learned that it was Rated R, I decided to try to give it a chance. Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I had expected, it actually had some really great laughs and is a heck a lot better than The Proposal. But once again The Ugly Truth fell back into the ugly formula of clichés that are just annoying and there were quite a few things that I would have done differently with the story, I'll first explain the plot.\n\nAbby, a TV producer, is coming home from another disastrous date one night, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, "The Ugly Truth," run by Mike Chadway, whose cynicism of relationships prompts Abby to call into the show to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers that the station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings, and the station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show to bring them back up. At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds Abby to be a control freak. However she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin living next to her, and Mike persuades her to follow his lead. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to quit; he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. But being a romantic comedy, Abby and Mike instead fall for each other as usual, you know how the story goes.\n\nNow things I would've done different, if you don't want spoilers then don't read on: there is a child that comes into Mike's apartment, he and Mike get along great, I'm thinking that's his son; instead it's his nephew. I think this would have added substance to his character and made him more likable and would have had a better story on why he was so bitter on women, maybe like the mother left him or something. Second: I honestly would have had Abby chosen the doctor over Mike. Katherine and Gerad are great on screen together, but their chemistry for this film I felt was more of a great friendship than falling in love with each other. Her choosing Mike over the doctor was so typical, I would have had the doctor find out about what was going on and then take her back realizing that he still liked her very much and then Mike ends up with some slutty girl as usual happy with his shallow life, but still enjoying it. Third: no tired formulas, no girl best friend supporting everything the lead female does, no big kiss in front of an audience, no dramatic of finding out what a kiss meant. Fourth: why do we have gorgeous people claiming they have a hard time finding love or supposedly not having sex for a year? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm finding it hard to believe that girls who look like Katherine Heigl are having the hardest time finding love.\n\nBut there are some positives in the film, honestly I did have a good time watching this film over all, it was just the ending that killed the movie. But even the little rip off of When Harry Met Sally where Abby is wearing vibrating panties at a company dinner and someone saying what was in her food to have the same effect, it's an old joke but it never gets old. I loved that this was a Rated R rom-com because the reason MOST of these movies don't work are due to the fact that they're too family friendly and very much unrealistic. Not to say that The Ugly Truth is completely realistic, but more so than most films. We have some sick jokes but get a great laugh, Abby is going to a baseball game with Colin, her crush, and she accidentally spills her drink on his lap and starts rubbing his pants to clean them and the kiss cam lowers in on them with a bad angle looking like she's just having fun with his hot dog. Honestly I think most of the theater had a hard time catching their breath on that joke, no one could stop laughing. Katherine and Gerad do have great chemistry on screen, I just think it would have worked better as a friendship. So I would say this is better suited as a rental vs. a theater view. It's a lot better than I expected but had more potential as it falls back into the same old tired formula.\n\n6/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":207931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's a lot better than I expected but had more potential as it falls back into the same old tired formula.\n\n6/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":207931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.\n\nStory: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her "resurrection" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.\n\nActing: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.\n\nAction: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.\n\nCinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.\n\nDirection: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.\n\nOverall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5\n\nP.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":375498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The cast was great once again with Paul Walker returning to his role as Brian O'Connor and Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendes adding new character dynamics. Tyrese in particular was great. If there's one thing the first film lacked it's that there wasn't much humor. It was a very serious film and while that's great, Tyrese's character, Roman Pearce, added some great laughs at some unexpected moments. The cinematic effects were much better in this film also. The only negatives were that some of the action sequences were a little overboard (Dukes of Hazard jump for example) and the dialogue had too much street car jargon to the extent that some of it felt forced. "That Yenko will snap a speedo in 5 seconds" is an example of the type of dialogue that doesn't actually feel genuine in its placement in the film. Nonetheless, a really good movie with solid acting and great action.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If there's one thing the first film lacked it's that there wasn't much humor. It was a very serious film and while that's great, Tyrese's character, Roman Pearce, added some great laughs at some unexpected moments. The cinematic effects were much better in this film also. The only negatives were that some of the action sequences were a little overboard (Dukes of Hazard jump for example) and the dialogue had too much street car jargon to the extent that some of it felt forced. "That Yenko will snap a speedo in 5 seconds" is an example of the type of dialogue that doesn't actually feel genuine in its placement in the film.

I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.\n\nStory: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her "resurrection" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.\n\nActing: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.\n\nAction: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.\n\nCinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.\n\nDirection: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.\n\nOverall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5\n\nP.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":375498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.\n\nStory: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her "resurrection" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.\n\nActing: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.\n\nAction: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.\n\nCinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.\n\nDirection: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.\n\nOverall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5\n\nP.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":375498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He's a surgeon from sophisticated, worldly London who moves to (fictional) Portwenn on the coast of Cornwall because he suddenly becomes ill at the sight of blood. This is not a good omen for a surgeon. He quits to become a general practitioner and he's satisfied, thanks very much, with checkups, prescriptions and referrals.\n\nThe foul-mannered, blunt-spoken Doc smugly considers himself above the crowd, but he soon learns he is really BELOW the crowd, out of step with Portwenn's eccentricities, value systems and peculiar burghers, who make the mere lunatics of London look normal by comparison.\n\nMartin Clunes is terrific in the lead role. He is a tall, charismatic and not exactly handsome actor who looks like he would be more comfortable playing cops and heavies. He is, instead, a consummate comic actor. His facial and physical comedy, his frequent bouts of exasperation and bewilderment, are things to behold. (Note: some wags have compared him to 'House,' from the popular TV drama of the same name. House is played by Hugh Laurie, another splendid Brit, and that's about where the comparison begins and ends. They are two very different characters in two very different shows.)\n\nPortwenn's local population, with its twisted logic that somehow makes perfect sense, is represented through the tour-de-force acting of supporting players: Bert (Ian McNeice, who always dazzles playing offbeat, world-weary philosophical characters); Louise (the charming and beautiful Caroline Catz), who either loves Martin or wants to kill him; corn-rowed Elaine (lovely Lucy Punch) as the ditzy assistant with her own set of secretarial ethics; and Doc's Aunt Joan (the great Stephanie Cole, who has been delighting audiences since the 1960s).\n\nDominic Minghella, he of the Minghella mob of talented artists (brother Anthony directed 'The English Patient'), is the brains behind this brilliant controlled chaos.\n\nDon't miss this program. TV shows that are both funny AND intelligent are the rarest of TV fare.\n\nAnd a fast footnote: let us all bow our heads and pray that Hollywood doesn't try to remake this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Knight Rider.\n\nIn 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they did not commit.  They promptly escaped a maximum security stockade into the Los Angeles Underground.  Today, still wanted by the government, they exist as soldiers of fortune.  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...\n\nThe A-Team.\n\nWith a script any eight year old would love, the four members of the A-Team went off every week to somewhere in America to help someone who couldn't find help anywhere else.  They battled impossible odds (with impossible storylines) and managed to stay one step ahead of the law.  They were always predictable, heroic, and fun.  God bless the eighties, and long live TV Land.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35564,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"1983-01-23","keywords":"gmc vandura,cult tv,good versus evil,mercenary,hero for hire","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000577/","name":"George Peppard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001558/","name":"Mr. T","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776239/","name":"Dwight Schultz"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004798/","name":"Stephen J.

Now I like it and find myself rootin' for the humans and wanting a piece of the skitters myself. Each episode is better than the last (so far) and the story line is progressing (slowly). To me, this show is like FireFly. Started of a little far-fetched, but like FireFly, is becoming a show I anticipated to see the next episode. Sadly, FireFly was canceled just as the story line was progressing and when it developed a good audience. Just hope this show develops in the same manner but not canceled. Curious, however, to how long the conflict will last, will the aliens and humans learn to coexist, will there be a victory and defeat of either side....and will there be some higher philosophical question for all of us to ask ourselves about life, existence, family and humanity. If that develops into the storyline....this will surely be a show with a following like FireFly and one worth watching again.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86697,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2011-06-19","keywords":"alien,military,father son relationship,alien invasion,supernatural power","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001864/","name":"Noah Wyle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2397366/","name":"Drew Roy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2684485/","name":"Maxim Knight"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003158/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088248/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305826/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Requiem","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi250064153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MTMyMjkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYxNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MTMyMjkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYxNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"See the first full trailer for the fourth season of TNT's "Falling Skies"."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
