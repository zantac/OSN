This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy.

The common link between CM &amp; CSI is that the question of "How?" is always more interesting.\n\nThe only difference: CSI centers around physical evidence gathering &amp; collecting the pieces to solve a puzzle.\n\nCriminal Minds involves more psychology &amp; sociology. We, as viewers, want to know what makes someone tick as a way to prevent crimes from occurring again.\n\nAnother reason why I enjoy this showed so much is how the characters put their expertise in play to solve some of the most twisted people around.\n\nAs casting is concerned: Patinkin is perfect as Jason Gideon. If you think about it, he's more like a professor citing famous lines from Einstein, Faulkner, etc.\n\nWhen I first read those lines, it didn't make sense at first, but as you watch each episode , the lines that Gideon cites has more meaning to it.\n\nFor example: Einstein: "Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world." Gideon is saying that the human mind is the deadliest weapon of all, &amp; we are capable of anything &amp; everything of achieving all kinds of possibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Criminal Minds is the kind the of show that anyone can enjoy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":167962,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A little bit of psychological and sociological background being introduced to the general public to get a grasp on criminal profiling. The episodes were entertaining, the characters relatable yet realistically flawed. However from season 6 on, this series just spiraled downward. The cases lost the grip they had had on the audience, became dull and left you cold. In an attempt to make up for unimaginative cases and the routine that had set it when watching the team profile, gore and violence was increased and to even it out cheesy background plots for the characters were added. Sometimes it's just better to quit while you're ahead.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174727,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

In my opinion, CSI: Miami is superior to the original and a good foundation for (the also superior) CSI:NY.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the original is the original, but the fact that the real Miami/Dade CSI's are cops first allows this show to explode in gunfire at any moment...and place our lead, David Caruso, at the center of the action. Now I want to make something clear: Almost 15 years ago I saw some of Caruso's early work and I was trying to figure out what all the fuss was about. What makes THIS guy a sex symbol (on NYPD Blue)? Then, just as fast as he becomes a major star, he exits Blue, makes two movies that bombed (the really good "Kiss Of Death" and the laughable "Jade") and he's suddenly poison. It was after seeing Caruso in Kiss of Death and a previous film, The King of New York" that I realized we were missing one of the last REAL tough guys.\n\nCSI: Miami has brought him back. Caruso spearheads this show with a vengeance. Sure his line readings have their own stilted rhythm, but he did the same thing on NYPD Blue and people loved him then. Caruso with a gun in his hand looks more natural than anything else I have seen on TV (and my favorite show is The Shield).\n\nCSI: Miami is action packed. The stories are seedier. The cinematography is unmatched by any other show. Go watch the DVDs. Tune in Monday nights. I swear, you'll be a convert.\n\nThen go watch Gary Sinise give the performance of his life in CSI:NY. You'll be glad you did.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54815,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-09-23","keywords":"place name in title,city name in title,city in title,united states of america,usa","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000325/","name":"David Caruso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698346/","name":"Emily Procter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735226/","name":"Adam Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231929/","name":"Ann Donahue","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578856/","name":"Carol Mendelsohn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

The common link between CM &amp; CSI is that the question of "How?" is always more interesting.\n\nThe only difference: CSI centers around physical evidence gathering &amp; collecting the pieces to solve a puzzle.\n\nCriminal Minds involves more psychology &amp; sociology. We, as viewers, want to know what makes someone tick as a way to prevent crimes from occurring again.\n\nAnother reason why I enjoy this showed so much is how the characters put their expertise in play to solve some of the most twisted people around.\n\nAs casting is concerned: Patinkin is perfect as Jason Gideon. If you think about it, he's more like a professor citing famous lines from Einstein, Faulkner, etc.\n\nWhen I first read those lines, it didn't make sense at first, but as you watch each episode , the lines that Gideon cites has more meaning to it.\n\nFor example: Einstein: "Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world." Gideon is saying that the human mind is the deadliest weapon of all, &amp; we are capable of anything &amp; everything of achieving all kinds of possibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Criminal Minds is the kind the of show that anyone can enjoy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":167962,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I never imagined that any show about the FBI could be so hateful against the United States.\n\nThe assistant Chief of the New York division, played by the lame Jeremy Sisto, spends his time trying to overturn convictions because he spent ten years in the FBI blacking out due to alcoholism, and sleeping with his subordinate, who covered for his mis-deeds. That is the new FBI.\n\nIn almost every episode, the FBI agents discuss the criminals, murderers, terrorists, etc., as being the victims of U. S. society, American values, white America, etc. Every story throws new shade on the FBI and/or the USA as a nation, or American culture.\n\nI have never seen any of the FBI agents say, "Wow that guy was just plain evil," unless it was a white Anglo who was (always) a racist, Neo-Nazi, white supremacist, etc. The message of this show is that white people are evil, and everyone else, including the criminals, are victims of "White America." I am not white, and I find this show incredibly disturbing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11503,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I never imagined that any show about the FBI could be so hateful against the United States.\n\nThe assistant Chief of the New York division, played by the lame Jeremy Sisto, spends his time trying to overturn convictions because he spent ten years in the FBI blacking out due to alcoholism, and sleeping with his subordinate, who covered for his mis-deeds. That is the new FBI.\n\nIn almost every episode, the FBI agents discuss the criminals, murderers, terrorists, etc., as being the victims of U. S. society, American values, white America, etc. Every story throws new shade on the FBI and/or the USA as a nation, or American culture.\n\nI have never seen any of the FBI agents say, "Wow that guy was just plain evil," unless it was a white Anglo who was (always) a racist, Neo-Nazi, white supremacist, etc. The message of this show is that white people are evil, and everyone else, including the criminals, are victims of "White America." I am not white, and I find this show incredibly disturbing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11503,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.\n\nThe thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.\n\nAlso all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).\n\nThe reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. \n\n9 out of 10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-09-20","keywords":"shared universe,ampersand in title,punctuation in title,sexually motivated,sexually motivated assault","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002127/","name":"Mariska Hargitay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005221/","name":"Christopher Meloni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001384/","name":"Ice-T"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069685/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080319/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3079995673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A little bit of psychological and sociological background being introduced to the general public to get a grasp on criminal profiling. The episodes were entertaining, the characters relatable yet realistically flawed. However from season 6 on, this series just spiraled downward. The cases lost the grip they had had on the audience, became dull and left you cold. In an attempt to make up for unimaginative cases and the routine that had set it when watching the team profile, gore and violence was increased and to even it out cheesy background plots for the characters were added. Sometimes it's just better to quit while you're ahead.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174727,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

The film follows the relentless defender of the EU along the roads of some 20 intertwined countries, but also goes out of the theatres to meet situations and faces.

I as a Dane can relate to this movie, as if it were written directly to the individual citizen. The way the story is bound together with great dialogue and humor is indeed phenomenal, the way the story criticize the danish alcohol-culture is even more breathtaking, and thought-provoking. With of course amazing performances from Lars Ranthe, Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang and Mads Mikkelsen.

It truly is bewildering. Apparently the people scoring this film low are either Soviet sympathizers, Nazi sympathizers, or hate realistic war films?\n\nI don't know. The low score makes no sense to me.\n\nWhat does make sense to me is that director Igor Kopylov crafts a fine film around one of the many pivotal battles that helped shape Russia's eventual victory over the Germans leading up to the battle of Stalingrad.\n\nOvsyannikovo was one of the many small strategic points in the battlefield that the Soviets needed to capture to push the Germans out. The film itself is just a small look at the many lives lost trying to capture and secure this small village.\n\nThe film does a fine job of not shying away from the brutal and sadistic nature of the Germans to secure victory (massacring and raping civilians) and then systematically wiping out opposing forces.\n\nThe film also does a fine job of making it known that some of the biggest hurdles the Russian army faced in the war was from Soviet leadership!\n\nThe bureaucracy and stupidity of the Soviets cost many great and brave men their lives. A central sub-plot to the film outlines how the already thinning company would lose additional soldiers over the most trivial and banal of things.\n\nBut this is what happened, and this is why so many Russians died during World War II (and thereafter during the reign of the Soviet Union).\n\nAs far story structure is concerned, the film mostly only centers around the men stationed Ovsyannikovo, with a few snippets of the commanding officers trying to justify their logic in not sending reinforcements or properly aiding their soldiers. I almost wanted to spit into the face of the commanders wasting he lives of these brave soldiers; that's just how engrossing the film had become.\n\nBut what's more is that all of this feels authentic. Kopylov makes the battles feel grounded and realistic for the most part, and some soldiers suffer shell shock, PTSD, delirium and panic attacks, just as you would expect under those conditions. The violence is also fairly visceral and realistic; the special effects team make use of both squibbing and CGI, so while those of you who may hate the look of CGI blood, there is still some squibbing effects that help highlight the realism of the gun battles.\n\nOverall, it's a fascinating watch. Of course it's not as over-the-top and action-packed as T-34, but it is very similar to Kim Druzhinin and Andrey Shalopa's tightly hewn war-thriller, Panfilov's 28.

Heartily recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29759,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-03-06","keywords":"prison break,apartheid,south africa,politics,prison","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1818738457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY0MjE2MmItNDg2My00YjQzLWE5YmEtOTk1YmQzZjAzZWRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY0MjE2MmItNDg2My00YjQzLWE5YmEtOTk1YmQzZjAzZWRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Two South Africans, imprisoned for working on behalf of the ANC, determine to escape from the notorious Robben Island prison.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3206486/","name":"Daniel Webber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001324/","name":"Ian Hart"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2381441/","name":"Francis Annan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103914/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0465725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0869094/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2381441/","name":"Francis Annan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10505382/","name":"L.H.

 --- Description: Parlez-moi d'amour: Directed by Sophie Marceau. With Judith Godrèche, Niels Arestrup, Anne Le Ny, Laurence Février. Justine and Richard's 15-year relationship ends in separation due to irreconcilable differences with Justine maintaining custody of their three boys. Her new life means having to deal with being a single parent but at the same time, she comes to terms with her own parents' divorce and finds a common bond with her long-suffering mother. Richard, a renowned author, deals with the situation by devoting all his attention to his writing. Both are forced to confront their uncertain futures, while examining what led to the breakdown of their marriage." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0304520/","name":"Parlez-moi d'amour","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzMTMzODk2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3MDkyMQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Justine and Richard's 15-year relationship ends in separation due to irreconcilable differences with Justine maintaining custody of their three boys.

However she seems to be struggling with the story-telling. It's supposed to be a very touching movie about love worn away through the years by all kinds of torment in life, but... it just isn't quite reached the point that touches peoples' hearts yet. Anyway it's not bad as a debut and I look forward to more good works by Sophie -- not just a beautiful face!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-10-09","keywords":"f rated","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002105/","name":"Judith Godrèche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0034390/","name":"Niels Arestrup","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494504/","name":"Anne Le Ny"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000521/","name":"Sophie Marceau"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070597/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022244/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000521/","name":"Sophie Marceau"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="fr">Animée par une petite bande de chroniqueurs passionnés, cette émission mensuelle consacrée exclusivement aux séries passe en revue les sorties et les tournages qui font l'actualité des séries à succès et celles qui méritent d'être découvertes. Pourquoi certaines fictions accrochent et touchent plus que d'autres ? Les images seront analysés afin d'apporter un point de vue technique. Autour des séries évènements, des découvertes et des pépites, les débats sont garantis sans spoilers.</desc>

But that epic-worthy premise gets weighed down by a search for a brother who's gone AWOL, run-ins with Russian military (which is okay if they weren't made into villains), and multitudes of minor story branches that just seem to drag the story into smaller issues that muddle the show and makes the story feel small. What gets lost is the bigger picture, of what is transpiring at the historical level during this time period.

Kitsch does a passable job, but the show can't seem to make up its mind on whether he's a scrappy street cop or a polished NY police brass savvy in the ways of bureaucracy and politics. I suppose it's part of his backstory, but to me, it feels unnecessary, just like all the f-bombs casually thrown in.\n\nDespite all its shortcomings, the show is beautifully shot, the acting is mostly good (mostly the Germans), and there is a main story that makes its way through, I think.

"The Defeated", the show's original title, might have been better. But neither really captures the show that well. Set in post-war Germany shortly after their defeat, the show's early episodes seem to do a decent job of capturing the misery, desperation, and the broken remains of a country and its people who not only lost the war, but had their civilization bombed into submission.\n\nAnd perhaps that's why a story of a NYPD cop trying to help rebuild and reestablish law and order sounded like a good premise. But that epic-worthy premise gets weighed down by a search for a brother who's gone AWOL, run-ins with Russian military (which is okay if they weren't made into villains), and multitudes of minor story branches that just seem to drag the story into smaller issues that muddle the show and makes the story feel small. What gets lost is the bigger picture, of what is transpiring at the historical level during this time period. This is no Babylon Berlin, which in my opinion, is a masterpiece.\n\nAnd what's up with the Brooklyn accent? Kitsch does a passable job, but the show can't seem to make up its mind on whether he's a scrappy street cop or a polished NY police brass savvy in the ways of bureaucracy and politics. I suppose it's part of his backstory, but to me, it feels unnecessary, just like all the f-bombs casually thrown in.\n\nDespite all its shortcomings, the show is beautifully shot, the acting is mostly good (mostly the Germans), and there is a main story that makes its way through, I think. It's not entirely a waste of time to watch--if you have the time, that is.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2295,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-10-30","keywords":"police protagonist,american cop abroad,american in germany,post war germany,world war two","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2018237/","name":"Taylor Kitsch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355910/","name":"Michael C.

The Swinging Sixties are being hard on Paul Prunier, a modest cab driver who writes classical symphonies in his spare time.

Mayhem ensues as the song becomes a national hit, and everyone tries to cash in on Paul's phenomenal success.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1962-12-19","keywords":"place name in title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0105475/","name":"Claude Brasseur","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0138405/","name":"Jean Carmet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0142707/","name":"Mathilde Casadesus"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161716/","name":"Jean Chérasse"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021146/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159312/","name":"Claude Choublier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161716/","name":"Jean Chérasse","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0478627/","name":"Georges de La Grandière"],"duration":"PT1H22M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This sort of inconsequential story is of course the most difficult to tell, but Deville's sure hand avoids all the traps of sentimentality, and gives us a wonderful lesson in cinema.

This sort of inconsequential story is of course the most difficult to tell, but Deville's sure hand avoids all the traps of sentimentality, and gives us a wonderful lesson in cinema. Seen four decades later, this movie acquires also the function of a time capsule: this was Paris in the early sixties, there was an air of joyful excitement which today's politically correct movies lack. Definitely a fingerlicking movie!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":198,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1962-02-02","keywords":"blonde","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900557/","name":"Marina Vlady","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0617736/","name":"Macha Méril","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900062/","name":"Michel Vitold"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0222545/","name":"Michel Deville"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046889/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0173953/","name":"Nina Companeez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0222545/","name":"Michel Deville"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is definitely not high on the intellect scale, but it is a sweet romantic comedy. I agree this is not Marilyn's best film, but her performance in the role is better than anyone else could have done it; very cute and believable.  Some of the writing really seems to target Marilyn's own personal life (I don't know if they did that on purpose), especially when she talks about going to night school.  Also during the song "Incurably Romantic," Marilyn's dress is flying up (a parallel to "The Seven-Year Itch?").  Her performance of the song "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" is just great.  It's really a lot of fun. The cameos are awesome, they really make the film into a "time capsule" of the most popular comedian, dancer, and singer of the time.  Tony Randall has a nice supporting role throughout the film; he is great in the scene where he sees Jean-Marc Clement's "softer side."

This is definitely not high on the intellect scale, but it is a sweet romantic comedy. I agree this is not Marilyn's best film, but her performance in the role is better than anyone else could have done it; very cute and believable.  Some of the writing really seems to target Marilyn's own personal life (I don't know if they did that on purpose), especially when she talks about going to night school.  Also during the song "Incurably Romantic," Marilyn's dress is flying up (a parallel to "The Seven-Year Itch?").  Her performance of the song "My Heart Belongs to Daddy" is just great.  It's really a lot of fun. The cameos are awesome, they really make the film into a "time capsule" of the most popular comedian, dancer, and singer of the time.  Tony Randall has a nice supporting role throughout the film; he is great in the scene where he sees Jean-Marc Clement's "softer side." Yves Montand and Marilyn Monroe have the strangest relationship in the movie, and you have to feel bad for Jean-Marc!  He is not used to NOT getting the girl!  Yves plays this very well, I think.

But, Some Like It Hot is one of those jet planes where you got to tight your seat belt and forget everything else to enjoy the joyride or you would fall off your seat.\n\nI feel casting in a movie is one of the most under discussed elements of movie making amongst general public but it plays a very significant role in the success of a movie and SLIH is the prime example of it. Apart from Jack Lemmon, none of the protagonists were known for their superior acting skills and they would not have made the cut for a Billy Wilder piece. But, in retrospect, who other than Tony Curtis who had a boyish look and at the same time possessed sharp features could have played a saxophone playing woman charmer who could cross dress to be a part of a woman band. You can only get a flawless performance from a bad actor only if he/she is playing himself/herself and that is the exact reason why Marilyn Monroe wows you in every scene of Some Like It Hot. She is playing a dumb, vivacious and vulnerable damsel who can sing, doesn't mind sleeping with a charming guy whenever she gets a chance and then dips herself in a whiskey bottle when left all alone with herself. Jack Lemmon with a broad muscular jawline was surely the one who had a better chance of getting caught as someone not in the right clothes, but that is very small price to pay, as an actor of his caliber was indispensable to the cause of SLIH. He has an amazing sense of timing when it comes to humor; he is almost chaplinesque when it comes to expressions and the confidence with which he delivers his lines puts him right at the top of stack.\n\nI am not sure when was the concept of black humor introduced in the world of cinema, but, SLIH has to be one of the better examples from the old times where black humor is integrated in the comedy. The black humor is there only to make its presence felt and nothing more. Other than that SLIH is a fun filled journey of Gerald (Lemmon) and Joseph (Curtis), two musicians on the run from dangerous Chicago gangsters who are after their lives. They find their safe house in an all-woman band that is off to Florida for a string of performances. This is where they meet the gorgeous Sugar (Marilyn) and try their luck on flattering her. It is all about how Joseph manages to get ahead in the race and Gerald like a true friend tags along without any explaining or pleading by Joseph. This is what makes SLIH sweet. The necessary salt is added to the movie by little moments like women having a party on train, Sugar hiding whiskey in her stocking, Fielding (Joe Brown) hitting on Dalphe (Gerald disguised as a woman) and further complications that set in because of these. What makes this classical comedy special is the fact that it makes you laugh at so many occasions without being slapstick or cheap or using the chaos technique. And when it doesn't make you laugh, it makes you smile. Most importantly, the movie stays with you.\n\nThe manner in which the movie begins, it suddenly makes you wonder - that's too much of real car chasing and shooting for a black and white movie of 40's and then you realize it's done in 1959 and the movie was intentionally produced in black and white. The first scene itself is a cracker and will create a cocktail of emotions, with words like liquor, crime, party, death, music all floating around at the same time. There are plenty of scenes where the camera pans out from one object to another capturing multiple things with different moods and complexion in the same scene and that is a technique which I guess wasn't used quite frequently back then. Make-up job of Curtis and Lemmon is too good for those times and it would have been so important for that to have been correctly done as that is absolutely central to the whole plot. Marilyn's costumes are way modern and she carries them effortlessly.\n\nSome Like It Hot is without any doubt a classic but, probably in no other movie would have the last line played such an important role as in this. The finishing frames where Joe Brown utters the unexpected leave you pleasantly surprised and I am sure it would have had far better impact on the audience 50 years back.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253966,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Comedy","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"1959-03-19","keywords":"sex comedy,comedy of errors,disguise,all girl band,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Some Like It Hot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2371683353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for the classic comedy Some Like It Hot, starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000054/","name":"Marilyn Monroe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000348/","name":"Tony Curtis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000493/","name":"Jack Lemmon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047869/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011112/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224634/","name":"I.A.L.

Wambaugh was the only man qualified to tell this story since he came out of the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nThe story was not just a typical cop story where the cops always win. Rather, it was a story of the tragedy of a lost life, the broken life of another, and the tragic lives of two pathetic, small time killers who would spend the majority of their lives in and out of prison. It was this case that changed Los Angeles police policy from that time on.\n\nThe cast was little known at that time. Who would have thought Ted Dansen would go on to TV fame?

Wambaugh was the only man qualified to tell this story since he came out of the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nThe story was not just a typical cop story where the cops always win. Rather, it was a story of the tragedy of a lost life, the broken life of another, and the tragic lives of two pathetic, small time killers who would spend the majority of their lives in and out of prison. It was this case that changed Los Angeles police policy from that time on.\n\nThe cast was little known at that time. Who would have thought Ted Dansen would go on to TV fame? Who would have thought James Woods would become a big screen actor?

This is only my third, after Bakushu and Tokyo Story. Both of those I found dull, even Tokyo Story, which is often considered one of the best films ever made. I don't know the critical reputation of Autumn Afternoon, but I liked it a lot. In fact, it continues with Ozus favorite themes (which I do sincerely hope aren't the same in all his films, and that I've just accidentally picked similar ones): aging, marriage, and Westernization. Autumn Afternoon is less pushy than those other two films.

I'd like to praise the musical score specifically, which is very charming and beautiful. Other than that, I'd just like to say that Autumn Afternoon is a delightful and touching film.

I don't know the critical reputation of Autumn Afternoon, but I liked it a lot. In fact, it continues with Ozus favorite themes (which I do sincerely hope aren't the same in all his films, and that I've just accidentally picked similar ones): aging, marriage, and Westernization. Autumn Afternoon is less pushy than those other two films.

It had been one of the scandalous, passionate, and morbid stories of the interwar period, a story that competed on the front pages of Parisian newspapers in 1933 with the news about Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, and which had divided the French public opinion into two camps, as no another sensational affair had since the Dreyfus case. The heroine of the gloomy story was a 16-year-old girl from a working / mid-class neighborhood, who had poisoned her parents. The father had died but the mother survived. The investigation revealed the double life of a girl suffocated by the environment in which she lived, considered a sinister criminal by some and a victim of social conditions and a perverse family environment by others. However, Chabrol only mentions in passing the media scandal around this case, being rather fascinated by the young woman's personality and also fascinating his spectators in the way he tells the story of the crime and the circumstances that led to its committing.\n\nThe whole film revolves around the heroine played by Isabelle Huppert. The script is quite faithful to the story, presents the facts as reported by the press of the time and does not try to serve surprises or insert speculative interpretations about the reasons for the actions and the psychological sources of the acts committed by the young woman. The director's attention is focused on reconstructing the confined and devoid of personal separation in which the Noziere family lives, the bohemian environment in which the young high school girl spends her time in the company of students, crooks, and old bourgeois who take advantage of the youth of girls in need for money or sensations. Rejecting both moral judgments and psychoanalytic interpretations, Chabrol lets Isabelle Huppert build the role of the girl who, instead of teenage dreams, plunges into promiscuity, and who travels from adolescent rebellion to murder with an impassive coldness. We don't find too many reasons in the film that would put us as spectators in the camp of Violette's supporters, except for the personality of the actress who fills the role with gloomy feelings and self-destructive tension.\n\nIsabelle Huppert achieves with the part of Violette in this film one of the first great roles of a fabulous career. She is supported by Stéphane Audran (the director's second wife, whom he would break up after 14 years of marriage and many remarkable films in the same year 1978) and Jean Carmet, one of those talented French actors whom Chabrol was giving the opportunity of consistent parts even if they were not first rank stars. A special award should be given to those who recognize Fabrice Luchini in one of the first roles of his film career. The style of the story is interesting and elaborate, temporally separated frames continue visually one another, flashbacks and imaginary scenes (especially from Violetta's fantasies or nightmares) are interleaved nervously and non-linearly, but perfectly following the logic of the action. 'Violette Noziere' manages to describe the interwar social environment, with social contradictions, moral prejudices, inequalities and stigmas related to the status of women and the pressure of the press of sensation. The film also intents to be a psychological study into the motives of the crime. Here, I think intentionally, the answer is not clear. We are shown the conditions that can generate crime, but not the gates that open between reality and horror. Judgments belong to us, the spectators.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2246,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1978-05-24","keywords":"teenage girl,male frontal nudity,male nudity,reference to louis xvi,reference to the dreyfus affair","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000804/","name":"Stéphane Audran"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0138405/","name":"Jean Carmet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001031/","name":"Claude Chabrol"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015884/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061460/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060193/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0058286/","name":"Odile Barski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111302/","name":"Hervé Bromberger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0340190/","name":"Frédéric Grendel"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I remember liking the opening sequence and thinking the rest was an empty bore. Well, it's no longer a bore to me, at 36, and it's far from empty, but it's still not the masterpiece to me that it seems to be to most film fans.\n\nThe coolest thing about 8 1/2 is the way that it's clearly a film about the film itself... a film about a filmmaker who is making a film, whose analysis of the film he's working on is actually an analysis of the film you are watching - as you're watching it. Conceptually, it's brilliant - and it does do a very good job of making these layered themes work. However, it's simply not that exciting to watch overall - at nearly 2 1/2 hours, it is a bit of a challenge to enjoy all the way through. The movie somehow manages to simultaneously have so much going on, and still feel like so little is going on, for a great quantity of the run time. There are definitely some really phenomenal sequences - plenty of surrealism, often in visuals and sometimes in performance and dialogue. It's never DULL, but it's also not much fun.\n\nTo be honest, considering one of the over-arching themes is "infatuation with women", it's kind of ironic that the movie does not feature more memorable female characters. There's only one who's iconic but that's because her character represents "the devil" and she's only in a couple of quick scenes. Then, there's the stunning Claudia Cardinale who gets top billing but is actually only in about 1.5 scenes - and her primary scene is a very important one, one of the most important thematically, but, we don't really get much of HER from it. The rest just kind of redundantly trail off in nags throughout the movie - intentionally, but, it doesn't leave you with much. And Marcello Mastroianni's lead character Guido is a bit of a bore but he needs to be because that's kind of the point of the character. Again, it occurs with great purpose but it's simply not very entertaining to watch.\n\nIt's a complex film with a lot to offer, but not enough of what I enjoy about movies.

It stars Hurd Hatfield, George Sanders, Angela Lansbury, Donna Reed, Peter Lawford, Lowell Gilmore, Richard Fraser and Douglas Walton. Music is by Herbert Stothart and cinematography by Harry Stradling Sr.\n\nDorian Gray of Mayfair and Selby.\n\nOscar Wilde's Faustian tale about a young Victorian gentleman who sells his soul to retain his youth is given a magnificent make-over by MGM. Pumping into it a budget reputedly of $2 million, the look and feel is perfect for this macabre observation of vanity, greed and self destruction. In many ways it's still an under valued movie, mainly because there will always be Wilde purists who think it lacks the writer's poetic spikiness, while horror fans quite often venture into the picture expecting some sort of violent classic ripe with sex, drugs and debauchery unbound.\n\nLewin crafts his film in understated manner, never allowing the themes in the source material to become overblown just for dramatic purpose. He cloaks it all with an atmosphere of eeriness, thus keeping the debasing nature of Dorian Gray subdued. The horror aspects here mostly are implied or discussed in elegantly stated conversations, where the horror in fact is purely in the characterisation of Dorian himself. We really don't need to see actual things on screen, we are urged to be chilled to the marrow by his mere presence, and this works because Lewin has personalised us into this man's sinful descent by way of careful pacing and character formation.\n\nThere are some jolt moments of course, notably the famous inserts of Technicolor into the black and white film, the impact of such bringing the portrait of the title thundering into our conscious. However, this is not about thrill rides and titillation, because the film, like its source, is intellectual. Lewin is aided considerably by Stradling's beautiful photography, which in turn either vividly realises the opulent abodes or darkens the dens of iniquities, so just like Lewin, Stradling and the art department work wonders and prove to be fine purveyors of their craft.\n\nHatfield is wonderful, it's an inspired piece of casting, with his angular features and cold dead eyes, he effortlessly suggests the black heart now beating where once there was a soul. Yet even he, and the rest of the impressive cast, are trumped by Sanders as Lord Henry.

It stars Hurd Hatfield, George Sanders, Angela Lansbury, Donna Reed, Peter Lawford, Lowell Gilmore, Richard Fraser and Douglas Walton. Music is by Herbert Stothart and cinematography by Harry Stradling Sr.\n\nDorian Gray of Mayfair and Selby.\n\nOscar Wilde's Faustian tale about a young Victorian gentleman who sells his soul to retain his youth is given a magnificent make-over by MGM. Pumping into it a budget reputedly of $2 million, the look and feel is perfect for this macabre observation of vanity, greed and self destruction. In many ways it's still an under valued movie, mainly because there will always be Wilde purists who think it lacks the writer's poetic spikiness, while horror fans quite often venture into the picture expecting some sort of violent classic ripe with sex, drugs and debauchery unbound.\n\nLewin crafts his film in understated manner, never allowing the themes in the source material to become overblown just for dramatic purpose. He cloaks it all with an atmosphere of eeriness, thus keeping the debasing nature of Dorian Gray subdued. The horror aspects here mostly are implied or discussed in elegantly stated conversations, where the horror in fact is purely in the characterisation of Dorian himself. We really don't need to see actual things on screen, we are urged to be chilled to the marrow by his mere presence, and this works because Lewin has personalised us into this man's sinful descent by way of careful pacing and character formation.\n\nThere are some jolt moments of course, notably the famous inserts of Technicolor into the black and white film, the impact of such bringing the portrait of the title thundering into our conscious. However, this is not about thrill rides and titillation, because the film, like its source, is intellectual. Lewin is aided considerably by Stradling's beautiful photography, which in turn either vividly realises the opulent abodes or darkens the dens of iniquities, so just like Lewin, Stradling and the art department work wonders and prove to be fine purveyors of their craft.\n\nHatfield is wonderful, it's an inspired piece of casting, with his angular features and cold dead eyes, he effortlessly suggests the black heart now beating where once there was a soul. Yet even he, and the rest of the impressive cast, are trumped by Sanders as Lord Henry. Cynical, brutal yet rich with witticisms, in Sanders' excellent hands Lord Henry becomes the smiling devil like mentor perched on Dorian's shoulder. Dorian and Lord Henry are movie monsters, proof positive that not all monsters need to be seen hacking off limbs or drinking blood. In this case, the decaying of the soul is a far more terrifying experience.\n\nFascinating, eloquent, intelligent and frightening. 9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12492,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1945-03-03","keywords":"painting,painter,soul,hedonist,deal with the devil","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2741026585","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001695/","name":"George Sanders","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0368836/","name":"Hurd Hatfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001656/","name":"Donna Reed"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0928492/","name":"Oscar Wilde"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Coming along at a crossroads section in French fornication film history, with simulation rapidly rendered obsolete by full color penetration, Unia felt commercially compelled to retrieve his labor of love from domestic distribution at the eleventh hour, sprucing up its mildly naughty shenanigans with pornographic pickup shots, a common practice at this stage in the evolution of European erotic cinema. A similar fate befell his follow-up feature, LE PIED! a/k/a FLAT OUT, but at least this time around several of the original cast members (including Béatrice Harnois, Frédérique Barral and Pamela Stanford) stepped up to the plate to perform the "offensive" acts themselves. Realizing there was no way back, Unia embraced his new source of employment, churning out competently crafted carnal capers, albeit at a more reverential rate than his brethren in slime.\n\nCharacterized by both ecological concerns and an oddly protofeminist sensibility, allowing amorously autonomous heroines to challenge phallocratic patriarchy, his concise body of work was initially taken at face value by otherwise knowledgeable scribes as that of a female filmmaker, the anagrammatic "Reine Pirau" ! ESTELLE ET FLORA, with its devil may care eponymous erotic explorers, could serve as a prototype of the director's idiosyncratic approach, taken to Utopian extremes with B...COMME BEATRICE's harmonious matriarchal farming community. Subverting the myth of the rape of the Sabine women, L'ENLEVEMENT DES SABINES had a group of sexually disgruntled women joining forces against male egotism. Even though there's a price to pay for their defiance, a recurring turn of events throughout Unia's explicit endeavors, his female characters have the last word, obtaining vengeance both sophisticated and unexpected for the unbridled male violence inflicted upon them, a knee-jerk reaction towards their mates' challenging an increasingly antiquated status quo.\n\nAttempting to emulate EMMANUELLE's continued box office drawing power, with video rental and cable TV a reliable secondary source of income, Unia scheduled a brief return to real name respectability with a score of four tame trifles, all of which amazingly opened alongside Hollywood blockbusters at Paris first run theaters. Nobody's fool, the director made sure to shoot simultaneous - if sometimes substantially different - hardcore versions to maximize potential profits. Last as well as least of the lot, OUTRAGE AUX MOEURS approximates a cheapskate rendition of the already sordid if marginally popular (due in no small part to their pulp print source) BRIGADE MONDAINE skin-heavy "thrillers" searching to expose such tabloid-friendly subjects as white slavery and drug trafficking.\n\nThirtysomething movie mogul Claude Farrell ("Chris Garini" a/k/a porn performer Ghislain Garet, prominently featured in Gérard Kikoïne's NEVER ENOUGH) has the hots for aspiring actress Grendy Daumier (Valérie Houlier), star of his latest not-quite-porn blockbuster DORTOIR DES GRANDES - in reality, Unia's previous simulated opus COLLEGE DORMITORY - and at least a decade his junior. Unaware she's using him to further her career, with frequent trips to the tropical isle of St. Barts a pleasant bonus (not least in terms of production value), Claude receives the proverbial wake up call coming back from business earlier than expected to find Grendy giving it up to a lowly delivery guy. Shooting his rival for the unworthy tramp's affections, he goes on the lam, seeking refuge on a houseboat inhabited by another pair of cinema hopefuls, down to earth Chantal (Laetitia Thomas) and round-heeled Carla ("Ghislaine Kerdavid" a/k/a Michelle Davy, star of Michel Lemoine's LOVE IN PARADISE) who respond to Claude's disruptive presence in radically different ways. While Chantal seizes each opportunity to alert outsiders for help, Carla just comes on to him ! \n\nWhat little plot there is plays better as (albeit unintentional) comedy with wholly implausible situations - like Claude accompanying Chantal on a porn dubbing session since they both could do with the cash ?! - and some of the most wooden acting ever inflicted upon a paying audience. Ironically the sole cast member foregoing fornication film experience, totally talent-barren Houlier proves the prime offender with the fake tan sporting Garet a close contender. Frizzy-haired Thomas, who starred in Unia's simultaneously shot FESSES VIERGES A L'ESSAI AUX CARAIBES only to disappear without a trace, tries hard but is forced to face defeat by a belated change of heart turning her character into a complete moron. Ultimately, the delightful Davy comes off best, perpetually naked and wisely entrusted with most of the sex scenes. Stateside audiences may recall she starred (as "Nicole Vartan") in Jourdan Alexander's passable sequel TAXI GIRLS 2. Truncated orgy footage - check out FESSES VIERGES for the "inside scoop" ! - showcases a plethora of recognizable porn performers like mustachioed Jacky Arnal, incredible hunk Eric Saville, chunky Frank Balard, Karoline Houtart (the chubby-cheeked chick in a nun's habit also appearing in Michel Barny's AMOUR, FANTASMES ET FANTAISIE) plus a veritable who's who of Michel Lemoine cast-offs including Amanda Shell (FORBIDDEN PLEASURES), Chantal Trobert (MARILYN MON AMOUR) and Mina Houghe (HOT DESIRES). DoP Yves Dahan, who subsequently found his niche on French TV, makes the most of movie's exotic locations yet fails to enliven the pedestrian Paris portion, notwithstanding back to back car crashes, only one of which bears any tangential relation to the nonsensical narrative.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1985-11-06","keywords":"erotic thriller,female nudity,topless female nudity,sex on the beach,barefoot woman","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307455/","name":"Ghislain Garet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859126/","name":"Laetitia Thomas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0205849/","name":"Michelle Davy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881245/","name":"Pierre Unia"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014381/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881245/","name":"Pierre Unia"}],"duration":"PT1H20M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Coming along at a crossroads section in French fornication film history, with simulation rapidly rendered obsolete by full color penetration, Unia felt commercially compelled to retrieve his labor of love from domestic distribution at the eleventh hour, sprucing up its mildly naughty shenanigans with pornographic pickup shots, a common practice at this stage in the evolution of European erotic cinema. A similar fate befell his follow-up feature, LE PIED! a/k/a FLAT OUT, but at least this time around several of the original cast members (including Béatrice Harnois, Frédérique Barral and Pamela Stanford) stepped up to the plate to perform the "offensive" acts themselves. Realizing there was no way back, Unia embraced his new source of employment, churning out competently crafted carnal capers, albeit at a more reverential rate than his brethren in slime.\n\nCharacterized by both ecological concerns and an oddly protofeminist sensibility, allowing amorously autonomous heroines to challenge phallocratic patriarchy, his concise body of work was initially taken at face value by otherwise knowledgeable scribes as that of a female filmmaker, the anagrammatic "Reine Pirau" ! ESTELLE ET FLORA, with its devil may care eponymous erotic explorers, could serve as a prototype of the director's idiosyncratic approach, taken to Utopian extremes with B...COMME BEATRICE's harmonious matriarchal farming community. Subverting the myth of the rape of the Sabine women, L'ENLEVEMENT DES SABINES had a group of sexually disgruntled women joining forces against male egotism. Even though there's a price to pay for their defiance, a recurring turn of events throughout Unia's explicit endeavors, his female characters have the last word, obtaining vengeance both sophisticated and unexpected for the unbridled male violence inflicted upon them, a knee-jerk reaction towards their mates' challenging an increasingly antiquated status quo.\n\nAttempting to emulate EMMANUELLE's continued box office drawing power, with video rental and cable TV a reliable secondary source of income, Unia scheduled a brief return to real name respectability with a score of four tame trifles, all of which amazingly opened alongside Hollywood blockbusters at Paris first run theaters. Nobody's fool, the director made sure to shoot simultaneous - if sometimes substantially different - hardcore versions to maximize potential profits. Last as well as least of the lot, OUTRAGE AUX MOEURS approximates a cheapskate rendition of the already sordid if marginally popular (due in no small part to their pulp print source) BRIGADE MONDAINE skin-heavy "thrillers" searching to expose such tabloid-friendly subjects as white slavery and drug trafficking.\n\nThirtysomething movie mogul Claude Farrell ("Chris Garini" a/k/a porn performer Ghislain Garet, prominently featured in Gérard Kikoïne's NEVER ENOUGH) has the hots for aspiring actress Grendy Daumier (Valérie Houlier), star of his latest not-quite-porn blockbuster DORTOIR DES GRANDES - in reality, Unia's previous simulated opus COLLEGE DORMITORY - and at least a decade his junior. Unaware she's using him to further her career, with frequent trips to the tropical isle of St. Barts a pleasant bonus (not least in terms of production value), Claude receives the proverbial wake up call coming back from business earlier than expected to find Grendy giving it up to a lowly delivery guy. Shooting his rival for the unworthy tramp's affections, he goes on the lam, seeking refuge on a houseboat inhabited by another pair of cinema hopefuls, down to earth Chantal (Laetitia Thomas) and round-heeled Carla ("Ghislaine Kerdavid" a/k/a Michelle Davy, star of Michel Lemoine's LOVE IN PARADISE) who respond to Claude's disruptive presence in radically different ways. While Chantal seizes each opportunity to alert outsiders for help, Carla just comes on to him ! \n\nWhat little plot there is plays better as (albeit unintentional) comedy with wholly implausible situations - like Claude accompanying Chantal on a porn dubbing session since they both could do with the cash ?! - and some of the most wooden acting ever inflicted upon a paying audience. Ironically the sole cast member foregoing fornication film experience, totally talent-barren Houlier proves the prime offender with the fake tan sporting Garet a close contender. Frizzy-haired Thomas, who starred in Unia's simultaneously shot FESSES VIERGES A L'ESSAI AUX CARAIBES only to disappear without a trace, tries hard but is forced to face defeat by a belated change of heart turning her character into a complete moron. Ultimately, the delightful Davy comes off best, perpetually naked and wisely entrusted with most of the sex scenes. Stateside audiences may recall she starred (as "Nicole Vartan") in Jourdan Alexander's passable sequel TAXI GIRLS 2. Truncated orgy footage - check out FESSES VIERGES for the "inside scoop" ! - showcases a plethora of recognizable porn performers like mustachioed Jacky Arnal, incredible hunk Eric Saville, chunky Frank Balard, Karoline Houtart (the chubby-cheeked chick in a nun's habit also appearing in Michel Barny's AMOUR, FANTASMES ET FANTAISIE) plus a veritable who's who of Michel Lemoine cast-offs including Amanda Shell (FORBIDDEN PLEASURES), Chantal Trobert (MARILYN MON AMOUR) and Mina Houghe (HOT DESIRES). DoP Yves Dahan, who subsequently found his niche on French TV, makes the most of movie's exotic locations yet fails to enliven the pedestrian Paris portion, notwithstanding back to back car crashes, only one of which bears any tangential relation to the nonsensical narrative.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1985-11-06","keywords":"erotic thriller,female nudity,topless female nudity,sex on the beach,barefoot woman","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307455/","name":"Ghislain Garet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859126/","name":"Laetitia Thomas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0205849/","name":"Michelle Davy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881245/","name":"Pierre Unia"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014381/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881245/","name":"Pierre Unia"],"duration":"PT1H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I wonder why the sins of the father have to plague the lives of his children.  Why people rape, abuse, hurt, and maim.  In a perfect world everyone would be happy.  In a perfect world no one would ever want.  In a perfect world a women like Aileen Wurnos would not have been sentenced to die on death row, and in a real world I wouldn't have to write about a movie like MONSTER.  It's a movie that drips with exceptional performances, and yet leaves your soul so cold to the core.\n\nMONSTER is the tragic true story of a woman who longed for a friend, and nobody came to her aid.  It stars Charlize Theron (The Devil's Advocate) as Aileen Wurnos, one of the first women to ever die on death row.  Of course the film doesn't begin that way, when we first meet her she's sitting in the rain with a gun contemplating ending it all.  You see she's has no future. She has nothing but a past that's not worth repeating, and all she has in the world is in a storage locker. What little money she has, is gained by being a prostitute.  But one day in a little bar in Daytona Beach, Florida she meets and falls for a woman that finally makes her happy.\n\nThe woman is named Selby (Christina Ricci, The Opposite of Sex), and she's a young lesbian just trying to figure out the world for herself.  At first this relationship puts Aileen on cloud nine.  She's willing to do anything to provide for the first person that ever loved her.\n\nBut one night when Aileen kills a john who gets a little to rough, a series of events take our characters on a one way trip with destiny. Leaving the landscape of these two women's lives are forever changed.  If only someone had just been nice to Aileen.\n\nMONSTER is not a happy film.  It's one of those movies that leaves you dead at the end.  You lose faith in humanity; you lose faith in yourself.  I like these kinds of movies, cause they convict me.  Here I am a young guy who sometimes gets ticked off at a driver in front of me on the road.  For one split moment I have murderous anger when that guy cuts me off.  What if I was in Aileen's situation?  Would I do the same thing?  I would hope not, but hey you never know.\n\nIf there is one performance that will tear you up inside this year, it's Theron's.  For the entire movie you can hardly believe that this is, in real life, a beautiful women.  Theron throws all the glamour out the window, gaining weight and frumping herself up to the point of being ugly.  This is a complete 360 and she's so engrossing.  She carries the film to heights. A lesser actress might turn in a wonderful performance, but Theron was Aileen. This is some brilliant acting.\n\nI also give Kudos to Bruce Dern .  His character has the distinction of being the only person who shows any real compassion for Aileen.  While a small role it sticks out because it's the only real bit of bright light in an otherwise dark and gloomy picture.\n\nThe screenplay by Patty Jenkins (Who also directed) does a great job of giving Aileen and those around her life.  What Aileen did was reprehensible. What she did was evil, and she must pay for that.  But it allows for sympathy. Not all evil is dark and black, and not all people who murder are 100% culpable.  But yet you reap what you sow no matter what you're past.\n\n MONSTER is a well-made, brilliantly acted film that's not for the weak of heart.  It's engaging, engrossing, and realistic.  I think I want to rush out and get the silliest comedy I can find right now, because I need something to offset the dark tone of this film.  While it get a fine recommendation, I just hope that the next time you feel like treating someone like crap, you'll remember just how tragic the life of Aileen Wurnos turned tragic because nobody reached out."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Dieter is arrested by the peasants, tortured and sent to a prisoner camp, where he meets five other mentally ill prisoners.

But this is not a tour, and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sights.\n\nReda's father is in his twilight years, and wishes to do the Haj. However, since walking and taking the mule is out of the question, he chooses to travel to Mecca by car. He can't drive, and therefore enlists the help of Reda, to his son's protest, to get him there in their broken down vehicle.\n\nBut Reda doesn't see the point of having him go along, when his dad could opt for the plane. He resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldn't understand. And hence, we set off in this arduous journey with father and son, being not the best of pals.\n\nThe beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair, the challenges they face, the weird people they meet, having to duke it out in varied weather conditions, and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car. We see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other, the father trying to impose on his son, and the son trying to assert himself as an adult, but circumstances we see, reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water. Through the many encounters, they actually team up quite well despite their differences.\n\nIt's perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji, and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj. The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold, and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating. The sights of Europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon, so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destination.\n\nIt certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are.

I'm not a police man, not in Egypt, but still...this movie grabs you right in and makes you feel restless and worried, because everyone around you tries to play tricks on you, so who can you trust, if no one is trustworthy anymore?\n\nGo into that movie with an open mind, no expectations, just like I did and thank me later.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7631,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2017-07-05","keywords":"egypt,cairo egypt,egyptian police,2010s,police","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Nile Hilton Incident","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4229218073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA0NTU1MmEtMGE3ZS00ZmI5LWIyY2MtNGZkOWNmNjY0YmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA0NTU1MmEtMGE3ZS00ZmI5LWIyY2MtNGZkOWNmNjY0YmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267241/","name":"Fares Fares","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5080507/","name":"Mari Malek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5170525/","name":"Yasser Ali Maher"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757975/","name":"Tarik Saleh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0326635/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0122434/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0347482/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757975/","name":"Tarik Saleh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2549965/","name":"Magdi Abdelhadi"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Ip Man was the Wing Chun grandmaster and his most famous student was Bruce Lee. This film chronicles the years leading up to his success as a martial arts teacher. It stars Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as Ip Man and Zhang Ziyi as Gong Er, his main love interest. Kar Wai Wong directed and co-wrote the movie (with Jingzhi Zou and Haofeng Xu). Wong is famous for directing and writing other popular Hong Kong period piece dramas like '2046' and 'IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE'. I'd rate this flick about the same as Wong's others; I thought it was extremely beautiful to look at but it's also a tad too hard to follow and uninvolving.\n\nThe story focuses as much on Gong Er (Ziyi) as it does Ip Man and follows a love story between the two as they keep in contact for many years following a fight for Gong's family's honor. Ip Man had defeated her father, Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang) in a battle that was as much about philosophical ideas as combat. The film follows Ip Man's years during the Second Sino-Japanese War, in 1938, struggling through poverty with his family. It also focuses on Gong Er's attempt at vengeance against the man who murdered her father, Ma San (Zhang Jin).\n\nThe story is told in a very disjointed way and it was really hard for me to keep up with what was going on in it. I often find these epic Hong Kong Kung Fu flicks to be dull anyway and wasn't too interested in seeing this one. It did get mostly good reviews from critics though and it's nominated for two 2014 Oscars (in Cinematography and Costume Design). It definitely deserves those award nominations and is very breathtaking to look at. I also think Zhang Ziyi is one of the more beautiful and sexy women in cinema today and she gives a great performance here. I'm not sure how I feel about Leung Chiu-Wai as an actor, he's not bad in this movie but I didn't really learn to care for his character much at all. The martial-arts scenes are grand and epic though and I'm sure fans of the genre will be more than pleased.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTUUB4nMD6M","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32739,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-01-08","keywords":"ip man character,falling off a balcony,girl,crying,starving to death","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4109412633","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5NTA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMDc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5NTA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMDc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A story inspired by the life and times of the legendary kung fu master, Ip Man, and set in the tumultuous Republican era that followed the fall of ChinaÂ’s last dynasty, a time of chaos, division and war that was also the golden age of Chinese martial arts."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504897/","name":"Tony Chiu-Wai Leung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018221/","name":"Jin Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939182/","name":"Kar-Wai Wong"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070147/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074316/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239007/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939182/","name":"Kar-Wai Wong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1802940/","name":"Jingzhi Zou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4192630/","name":"Haofeng Xu"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Ip Man was the Wing Chun grandmaster and his most famous student was Bruce Lee. This film chronicles the years leading up to his success as a martial arts teacher. It stars Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as Ip Man and Zhang Ziyi as Gong Er, his main love interest. Kar Wai Wong directed and co-wrote the movie (with Jingzhi Zou and Haofeng Xu). Wong is famous for directing and writing other popular Hong Kong period piece dramas like '2046' and 'IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE'. I'd rate this flick about the same as Wong's others; I thought it was extremely beautiful to look at but it's also a tad too hard to follow and uninvolving.\n\nThe story focuses as much on Gong Er (Ziyi) as it does Ip Man and follows a love story between the two as they keep in contact for many years following a fight for Gong's family's honor. Ip Man had defeated her father, Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang) in a battle that was as much about philosophical ideas as combat. The film follows Ip Man's years during the Second Sino-Japanese War, in 1938, struggling through poverty with his family. It also focuses on Gong Er's attempt at vengeance against the man who murdered her father, Ma San (Zhang Jin).\n\nThe story is told in a very disjointed way and it was really hard for me to keep up with what was going on in it. I often find these epic Hong Kong Kung Fu flicks to be dull anyway and wasn't too interested in seeing this one. It did get mostly good reviews from critics though and it's nominated for two 2014 Oscars (in Cinematography and Costume Design). It definitely deserves those award nominations and is very breathtaking to look at. I also think Zhang Ziyi is one of the more beautiful and sexy women in cinema today and she gives a great performance here. I'm not sure how I feel about Leung Chiu-Wai as an actor, he's not bad in this movie but I didn't really learn to care for his character much at all. The martial-arts scenes are grand and epic though and I'm sure fans of the genre will be more than pleased.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTUUB4nMD6M","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32739,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-01-08","keywords":"ip man character,falling off a balcony,girl,crying,starving to death","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4109412633","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5NTA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMDc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5NTA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMDc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A story inspired by the life and times of the legendary kung fu master, Ip Man, and set in the tumultuous Republican era that followed the fall of ChinaÂ’s last dynasty, a time of chaos, division and war that was also the golden age of Chinese martial arts.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504897/","name":"Tony Chiu-Wai Leung","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018221/","name":"Jin Zhang"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939182/","name":"Kar-Wai Wong"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070147/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074316/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239007/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939182/","name":"Kar-Wai Wong","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1802940/","name":"Jingzhi Zou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4192630/","name":"Haofeng Xu"],"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I wonder why the sins of the father have to plague the lives of his children.  Why people rape, abuse, hurt, and maim.  In a perfect world everyone would be happy.  In a perfect world no one would ever want.  In a perfect world a women like Aileen Wurnos would not have been sentenced to die on death row, and in a real world I wouldn't have to write about a movie like MONSTER.  It's a movie that drips with exceptional performances, and yet leaves your soul so cold to the core.\n\nMONSTER is the tragic true story of a woman who longed for a friend, and nobody came to her aid.  It stars Charlize Theron (The Devil's Advocate) as Aileen Wurnos, one of the first women to ever die on death row.  Of course the film doesn't begin that way, when we first meet her she's sitting in the rain with a gun contemplating ending it all.  You see she's has no future. She has nothing but a past that's not worth repeating, and all she has in the world is in a storage locker. What little money she has, is gained by being a prostitute.  But one day in a little bar in Daytona Beach, Florida she meets and falls for a woman that finally makes her happy.\n\nThe woman is named Selby (Christina Ricci, The Opposite of Sex), and she's a young lesbian just trying to figure out the world for herself.  At first this relationship puts Aileen on cloud nine.  She's willing to do anything to provide for the first person that ever loved her.\n\nBut one night when Aileen kills a john who gets a little to rough, a series of events take our characters on a one way trip with destiny. Leaving the landscape of these two women's lives are forever changed.  If only someone had just been nice to Aileen.\n\nMONSTER is not a happy film.  It's one of those movies that leaves you dead at the end.  You lose faith in humanity; you lose faith in yourself.  I like these kinds of movies, cause they convict me.  Here I am a young guy who sometimes gets ticked off at a driver in front of me on the road.  For one split moment I have murderous anger when that guy cuts me off.  What if I was in Aileen's situation?  Would I do the same thing?  I would hope not, but hey you never know.\n\nIf there is one performance that will tear you up inside this year, it's Theron's.  For the entire movie you can hardly believe that this is, in real life, a beautiful women.  Theron throws all the glamour out the window, gaining weight and frumping herself up to the point of being ugly.  This is a complete 360 and she's so engrossing.  She carries the film to heights. A lesser actress might turn in a wonderful performance, but Theron was Aileen. This is some brilliant acting.\n\nI also give Kudos to Bruce Dern .  His character has the distinction of being the only person who shows any real compassion for Aileen.  While a small role it sticks out because it's the only real bit of bright light in an otherwise dark and gloomy picture.\n\nThe screenplay by Patty Jenkins (Who also directed) does a great job of giving Aileen and those around her life.  What Aileen did was reprehensible. What she did was evil, and she must pay for that.  But it allows for sympathy. Not all evil is dark and black, and not all people who murder are 100% culpable.  But yet you reap what you sow no matter what you're past.\n\n MONSTER is a well-made, brilliantly acted film that's not for the weak of heart.  It's engaging, engrossing, and realistic.  I think I want to rush out and get the silliest comedy I can find right now, because I need something to offset the dark tone of this film.  While it get a fine recommendation, I just hope that the next time you feel like treating someone like crap, you'll remember just how tragic the life of Aileen Wurnos turned tragic because nobody reached out."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy ("Cheaper by the Dozen") or dark and abstruse ("The Royal Tenenbaums"). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is "Little Miss Sunshine", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.\n\nThe title stems from a beauty pageant in which seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin of "Signs") competes. For a good portion of the film, the contest serves as a MacGuffin of sorts, putting an already odd mix of family members on the road in bizarre situations that call Vegas Vacation to mind.\n\nBut "Sunshine" is far more than the slapstick of "Vacation". It mixes humor both broad and subtle humor into a strange brew of comedy, poignancy, lessons, and life. Huge and deep issues are addressed, topics like death, dreams, and failure. Yet somehow the movie doesn't feel heavy. You'll walk out with a smile on your face because the movie sensibly touches on these issues, realizing that stuff happens and life continues, that the handling of adversity is often what defines people. And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.\n\n"Sunshine" may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.\n\nRather crude at times, "Sunshine" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.\n\nBottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":451870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"beauty pageant,cross country trip,gay,drugs,graduate student","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Little Miss Sunshine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3667263769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001057/","name":"Toni Collette"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206760/","name":"Jonathan Dayton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267512/","name":"Valerie Faris"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148020/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063938/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1578335/","name":"Michael Arndt"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy ("Cheaper by the Dozen") or dark and abstruse ("The Royal Tenenbaums"). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is "Little Miss Sunshine", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.\n\nThe title stems from a beauty pageant in which seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin of "Signs") competes. For a good portion of the film, the contest serves as a MacGuffin of sorts, putting an already odd mix of family members on the road in bizarre situations that call Vegas Vacation to mind.\n\nBut "Sunshine" is far more than the slapstick of "Vacation". It mixes humor both broad and subtle humor into a strange brew of comedy, poignancy, lessons, and life. Huge and deep issues are addressed, topics like death, dreams, and failure. Yet somehow the movie doesn't feel heavy. You'll walk out with a smile on your face because the movie sensibly touches on these issues, realizing that stuff happens and life continues, that the handling of adversity is often what defines people. And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.\n\n"Sunshine" may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.\n\nRather crude at times, "Sunshine" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.\n\nBottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":451870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"beauty pageant,cross country trip,gay,drugs,graduate student","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Little Miss Sunshine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3667263769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001057/","name":"Toni Collette","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206760/","name":"Jonathan Dayton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267512/","name":"Valerie Faris"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148020/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063938/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1578335/","name":"Michael Arndt"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This should be recommended viewing (and debating)  to anyone making documentary films.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39265,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"NC-17","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1992-11-04","keywords":"dark comedy,mockumentary,black comedy,satire,nudity","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688143/","name":"Benoît Poelvoorde","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688145/","name":"Jacqueline Poelvoorde-Pappaert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0660561/","name":"Nelly Pappaert"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069715/","name":"Rémy Belvaux","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0095298/","name":"André Bonzel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688143/","name":"Benoît Poelvoorde"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058482/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069715/","name":"Rémy Belvaux","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0095298/","name":"André Bonzel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688143/","name":"Benoît Poelvoorde"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

En parallèle, il porte son regard partout où l'attire son appareil photo. Dès l'adolescence, il se sent " derrière une vitre " en compagnie des autres. C'est dans cette solitude qu'il trouve sa place, caméra à l'épaule, et commence à filmer la vie qui l'entoure, ses œuvres échappant aussi bien au genre du cinéma romanesque qu'au documentaire. Entre images et silences, il livre des bribes de réflexions sur le regard et les relations qui existent entre le sujet, le filmeur et sa caméra.</desc>

Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy ("Cheaper by the Dozen") or dark and abstruse ("The Royal Tenenbaums"). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is "Little Miss Sunshine", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.\n\nThe title stems from a beauty pageant in which seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin of "Signs") competes. For a good portion of the film, the contest serves as a MacGuffin of sorts, putting an already odd mix of family members on the road in bizarre situations that call Vegas Vacation to mind.\n\nBut "Sunshine" is far more than the slapstick of "Vacation". It mixes humor both broad and subtle humor into a strange brew of comedy, poignancy, lessons, and life. Huge and deep issues are addressed, topics like death, dreams, and failure. Yet somehow the movie doesn't feel heavy. You'll walk out with a smile on your face because the movie sensibly touches on these issues, realizing that stuff happens and life continues, that the handling of adversity is often what defines people. And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.\n\n"Sunshine" may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.\n\nRather crude at times, "Sunshine" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.\n\nBottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":451870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"beauty pageant,cross country trip,gay,drugs,graduate student","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Little Miss Sunshine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3667263769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001057/","name":"Toni Collette"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206760/","name":"Jonathan Dayton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267512/","name":"Valerie Faris"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148020/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063938/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1578335/","name":"Michael Arndt"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Little Miss Sunshine: Directed by Jonathan Dayton, Valerie Faris. With Abigail Breslin, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano, Alan Arkin. A family determined to get their young daughter into the finals of a beauty pageant take a cross-country trip in their VW bus." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0449059/","name":"Little Miss Sunshine","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzNTgzODU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjEyMjMzMQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A family determined to get their young daughter into the finals of a beauty pageant take a cross-country trip in their VW bus.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0449059/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Pavel-8","dateCreated":"2006-12-09","inLanguage":"English","name":"Probably the best comedy of 2006.","reviewBody":"Comedies about families usually come in one of two genres. Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy ("Cheaper by the Dozen") or dark and abstruse ("The Royal Tenenbaums"). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is "Little Miss Sunshine", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.\n\nThe title stems from a beauty pageant in which seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin of "Signs") competes. For a good portion of the film, the contest serves as a MacGuffin of sorts, putting an already odd mix of family members on the road in bizarre situations that call Vegas Vacation to mind.\n\nBut "Sunshine" is far more than the slapstick of "Vacation". It mixes humor both broad and subtle humor into a strange brew of comedy, poignancy, lessons, and life. Huge and deep issues are addressed, topics like death, dreams, and failure. Yet somehow the movie doesn't feel heavy. You'll walk out with a smile on your face because the movie sensibly touches on these issues, realizing that stuff happens and life continues, that the handling of adversity is often what defines people. And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.\n\n"Sunshine" may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.\n\nRather crude at times, "Sunshine" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.\n\nBottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":451870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"beauty pageant,cross country trip,gay,drugs,graduate student","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Little Miss Sunshine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3667263769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001057/","name":"Toni Collette","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206760/","name":"Jonathan Dayton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267512/","name":"Valerie Faris"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148020/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063938/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1578335/","name":"Michael Arndt"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There isn't a great deal that's new about Yi'nan Diao's "The Wild Goose Lake". Walter Hill, Jean-Pierre Melville or more recently Michael Mann could have made this but Diao's use of flashbacks to propel the story and his superb use of locations certainly give this an edge. Despite the fatalistic tone it's hardly what you would call existential despite moving at a fairly leisurely pace. The plot isn't always easy to follow and sometimes it's hard to know who belongs to whose gang or who's a cop and who isn't.\n\nAs a cop killer on the run, Ge Hu is as cool as they come; in another lifetime Delon or Belmondo might have played this part and Lun-Mei Kwei is excellent as the film's femme fatale. In the end there is more atmosphere than action and the film's look finally overwhelms its content but it's great that in this day and age this kind of gangster film is being made and that China has taken such a fundamentally American genre and twisted it to its own ends.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There isn't a great deal that's new about Yi'nan Diao's "The Wild Goose Lake". Walter Hill, Jean-Pierre Melville or more recently Michael Mann could have made this but Diao's use of flashbacks to propel the story and his superb use of locations certainly give this an edge. Despite the fatalistic tone it's hardly what you would call existential despite moving at a fairly leisurely pace. The plot isn't always easy to follow and sometimes it's hard to know who belongs to whose gang or who's a cop and who isn't.\n\nAs a cop killer on the run, Ge Hu is as cool as they come; in another lifetime Delon or Belmondo might have played this part and Lun-Mei Kwei is excellent as the film's femme fatale. In the end there is more atmosphere than action and the film's look finally overwhelms its content but it's great that in this day and age this kind of gangster film is being made and that China has taken such a fundamentally American genre and twisted it to its own ends.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This would have made a much better short without the many many 10 second long lingering shots of expressionless faces or landscapes with, at best, mediocre framing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":279,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-06-05","keywords":"bus,classroom,mathematics class,taking a photograph,youth","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi233290777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWRhNWU4NTEtZjcyYi00YWZjLWFmZjMtZDBhMGJjNjhiNDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWRhNWU4NTEtZjcyYi00YWZjLWFmZjMtZDBhMGJjNjhiNDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9783900/","name":"Thomas Daloz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10662362/","name":"Néa Lüders","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9783901/","name":"Salvatore Ferro"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2126391/","name":"Blaise Harrison"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076118/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0321775/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625796/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2126391/","name":"Blaise Harrison","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1768265/","name":"Mariette Désert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4025265/","name":"Dimitri Kourtchine"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Songs by Gershwin, Porter, Berlin. Films from the 1930s and 40s. And the name of the lead character, Gatsby Welles, is just a little too cute. All of these are Woody Allen references. The problem is trying to force these references on these characters. It doesn't work.\n\nMaybe this film is meant to be a fantasy. It's not how 21-year-olds talk and behave in the modern world. It's how Woody Allen wishes they talked and behaved.\n\nNo one wants to see a film about people staring into their phones but the truth is that the two leading characters would have been texting each other every few minutes and wouldn't have gotten so completely separated from each other. I think it's clear that Woody Allen hates cell phones because they get in the way of his stories.\n\nI would have suggested two important changes to the film. Have it take place 25 years earlier--1994 instead of 2019, before everyone had their own phone--and make the characters in their mid-30s instead of their early 20s. With those two changes I think this would be remembered as one of Woody Allen's better films.

Goliath","reviewBody":"I cherish this movie; a lot of this is for personal reasons. The film is well done; Greg Kinnear really impressed me with this and little miss sunshine.\n\nI am a sales guy who sells to big companies. I recently gave ford a free education in a service we offer, and it took so much evangalizing, repetition, re-explanation and hitting them over the head. I was astonished that a business this big didn't have smarter people.\n\nThen, when we gave them our price and offer, they said "no thanks were going to build this in house rather than use you".........I felt a visceral connections to Bob Kearns.\n\nSuddenly, Ford is an expert on this. I would talk to anyone who would listen, and I put my blood into helping them improve their business. I have a new opinion of the buying and technology that Ford uses to run its operations.

The film is well done; Greg Kinnear really impressed me with this and little miss sunshine.\n\nI am a sales guy who sells to big companies. I recently gave ford a free education in a service we offer, and it took so much evangalizing, repetition, re-explanation and hitting them over the head. I was astonished that a business this big didn't have smarter people.\n\nThen, when we gave them our price and offer, they said "no thanks were going to build this in house rather than use you".........I felt a visceral connections to Bob Kearns.\n\nSuddenly, Ford is an expert on this. I would talk to anyone who would listen, and I put my blood into helping them improve their business. I have a new opinion of the buying and technology that Ford uses to run its operations. One of the reasons they might be the "least screwed up" of the auto makers" is their soul-less way of getting companies on their knees, and then kicking them down when you cry "uncle" for them.\n\nSorry for blabbing.

Decent viewing.","reviewBody":"A heart wants what it wants. It's the end of the 1960's, and this solid family man (Colin Firth) wants to take his Sunday hobby of sailing to the ultimate level, designing his own boat and travelling around the world in six months - alone, as part of the contest.\n\nAlso starring, Rachel Weisz as the man's wife, David Thewlis, and, well, a whole lot of ocean. Based on a true story, by the way.\n\nThe central part of "The Mercy" is watching Firth's character Donald Crowhurst defying dangers and both physical and psychological hardships of sailing the ocean, having to rely only on his hands, wits and hope that nothing critical breaks down because the contest won't allow making stops or having breaks during the world travelling tour.\n\nA worn-down man sulking on a boat in the middle of nowhere might seem like a boring idea for a feature-length movie, but somehow the authors have managed to get it right, so it turns out to be quite a gripping.\n\nWhat was essentially a exhausting and monotonous journey where the main activities were shovelling out the water and trying to keep the whole thing from drowning, is enriched by portraying the gradual mental eroding of Crowhurst.\n\nColin Firth is known as versatile actor and you can bet your sweet bottom that he does a wonderful job at conveying the depression, loneliness, exhaustion and general distress of his character, so he is able to command our attention whenever he's on screen.\n\nAnd all that is his usual reserved and delicate way, living the character, not acting it.\n\nIt's easily an awards worthy performance although at this time it's way too early to predict his chances of getting an Oscar nomination.\n\nThe same goes, by the way, to Rachel Weisz who has created a a surprisingly soulful and charming supporting role from what surely must have been a mostly decorative one on paper.\n\nShe does not have much screen time actually, but it gets compensated by a powerful speech in the end. A true Oscar moment, as they would say.\n\nParallel to Crowhurst's journey, we see bits from the life of people who wait for his return, including the family - but also his promoter trying to earn him some money for the expensive trip that threatens to bankrupt the whole family.\n\nThis turns out to be the movie's weakness which, while not quite ruining the dramatic impact of the whole thing, does not actually expand or strengthen the main story in a meaningful way.\n\nIt's okay in short doses - if only for variety's sake - but its emotional "nutritive value" falls flat compared to what's happening on the sea.\n\nThe director James Marsh's previous project, "The Theory of Everything", suffers from the same deficiency. It's pretty and watchable but he should have trimmed the final act.\n\nThat's all I wanted to say about this one. "The Mercy" is pretty good but its shallower side holds it back a notch. I am happy to have seen it but it will not linger on memory for long. Although I did like the deeper message that with grandiose plans comes a danger of falling into prison of one's own ego.\n\nWe have seen many instances of at least two similar-themed movies released in the same period of time. It also happens here, with "The Mercy" preceded by premiere of "Crowhurst" by almost five months, although the latter got a proper cinema release in the U.K. a few weeks later.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-11-28","keywords":"boat race,boat,sailing,lost at sea,period drama","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi297383961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4NGFjNjktYmFkNi00YTU5LWIyNDgtOTllZTk5NmE4OTY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4NGFjNjktYmFkNi00YTU5LWIyNDgtOTllZTk5NmE4OTY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"Yachtsman Donald Crowhurst's disastrous attempt to win the 1968 Golden Globe Race ends up with him creating an outrageous account of traveling the world alone by sea."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5663632/","name":"Eleanor Stagg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001838/","name":"Rachel Weisz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016428/","name":"James Marsh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010002/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1994243/","name":"Scott Z.

A true Oscar moment, as they would say.\n\nParallel to Crowhurst's journey, we see bits from the life of people who wait for his return, including the family - but also his promoter trying to earn him some money for the expensive trip that threatens to bankrupt the whole family.\n\nThis turns out to be the movie's weakness which, while not quite ruining the dramatic impact of the whole thing, does not actually expand or strengthen the main story in a meaningful way.\n\nIt's okay in short doses - if only for variety's sake - but its emotional "nutritive value" falls flat compared to what's happening on the sea.\n\nThe director James Marsh's previous project, "The Theory of Everything", suffers from the same deficiency. It's pretty and watchable but he should have trimmed the final act.\n\nThat's all I wanted to say about this one. "The Mercy" is pretty good but its shallower side holds it back a notch. I am happy to have seen it but it will not linger on memory for long. Although I did like the deeper message that with grandiose plans comes a danger of falling into prison of one's own ego.\n\nWe have seen many instances of at least two similar-themed movies released in the same period of time. It also happens here, with "The Mercy" preceded by premiere of "Crowhurst" by almost five months, although the latter got a proper cinema release in the U.K. a few weeks later.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-11-28","keywords":"boat race,boat,sailing,lost at sea,period drama","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi297383961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4NGFjNjktYmFkNi00YTU5LWIyNDgtOTllZTk5NmE4OTY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4NGFjNjktYmFkNi00YTU5LWIyNDgtOTllZTk5NmE4OTY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"Yachtsman Donald Crowhurst's disastrous attempt to win the 1968 Golden Globe Race ends up with him creating an outrageous account of traveling the world alone by sea.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5663632/","name":"Eleanor Stagg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001838/","name":"Rachel Weisz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016428/","name":"James Marsh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010002/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1994243/","name":"Scott Z.

Jesse Eisenberg's character comes off as a complete asshole within 10 minutes of the film, thanks to a really terrible scene between him and a Jewish hooker. None of the humor in that scene landed, which just made the situation really sad and uncomfortable to watch, and then kind of difficult to root for Eisenberg at all after that. Steve Carell isn't bad by any means, but he seems incredibly miscast in a role like this (not to say that he can't act in roles that are more serious, but this Hollywood film executive didn't really suit him). Both of the Dorfman parents come off as really awkward on screen and thus kill any of the jokes that they're meant to deliver. The only actor that gives a notable performance in this movie is Corey Stoll as the brother, but it's not enough. Kristin Stewart was mostly fine, but occasionally started picking up some of her infamous Kristin Stewartisms throughout. Carell and Eisenberg become really close out of nowhere, both of the couples' relationships are sped up by Woody Allen's narration (which doesn't really add anything to this film), and this movie is only 90 minutes long, so I feel as if they could have definitely spent more time with all of these relationships, instead of just having Woody tell us what was happening. And on top of all of this, while this is a beautiful film to look at, there is nothing new in this movie.

Jesse Eisenberg's character comes off as a complete asshole within 10 minutes of the film, thanks to a really terrible scene between him and a Jewish hooker. None of the humor in that scene landed, which just made the situation really sad and uncomfortable to watch, and then kind of difficult to root for Eisenberg at all after that. Steve Carell isn't bad by any means, but he seems incredibly miscast in a role like this (not to say that he can't act in roles that are more serious, but this Hollywood film executive didn't really suit him). Both of the Dorfman parents come off as really awkward on screen and thus kill any of the jokes that they're meant to deliver. The only actor that gives a notable performance in this movie is Corey Stoll as the brother, but it's not enough. Kristin Stewart was mostly fine, but occasionally started picking up some of her infamous Kristin Stewartisms throughout. Carell and Eisenberg become really close out of nowhere, both of the couples' relationships are sped up by Woody Allen's narration (which doesn't really add anything to this film), and this movie is only 90 minutes long, so I feel as if they could have definitely spent more time with all of these relationships, instead of just having Woody tell us what was happening. And on top of all of this, while this is a beautiful film to look at, there is nothing new in this movie. It's another Woody Allen movie with the same romances and love triangles centered around white people who like jazz with a pretty inconclusive and unsatisfying ending.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":73899,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2016-08-05","keywords":"1930s,uncle,high class,older man younger woman marriage,reference to james cagney","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Café Society","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4197038105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJkMTAwYTMtMjkzOC00M2ZhLThlMDgtNWNiNjBkZTBkNTc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJkMTAwYTMtMjkzOC00M2ZhLThlMDgtNWNiNjBkZTBkNTc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Café Society","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0251986/","name":"Jesse Eisenberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000095/","name":"Woody Allen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044777/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000605/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251858/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000095/","name":"Woody Allen"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

My big thank you to the 27th French Cinepanorama held in this month, after having gained twenty more years experience in life, now I know how to enjoy this movie.

It's high time he set out his stalls and a chain of unexpected events will unconsciously steer him towards his real direction...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1594,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-09-08","keywords":"self discovery,romantic rivalry,pregnancy,narrative,ghost writer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046347/","name":"Edouard Baer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0189887/","name":"Marie-Josée Croze","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180404/","name":"Clovis Cornillac"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016687/","name":"Laurent Tirard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037192/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016687/","name":"Laurent Tirard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0897065/","name":"Grégoire Vigneron"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Steve Carell isn't bad by any means, but he seems incredibly miscast in a role like this (not to say that he can't act in roles that are more serious, but this Hollywood film executive didn't really suit him). Both of the Dorfman parents come off as really awkward on screen and thus kill any of the jokes that they're meant to deliver. The only actor that gives a notable performance in this movie is Corey Stoll as the brother, but it's not enough. Kristin Stewart was mostly fine, but occasionally started picking up some of her infamous Kristin Stewartisms throughout. Carell and Eisenberg become really close out of nowhere, both of the couples' relationships are sped up by Woody Allen's narration (which doesn't really add anything to this film), and this movie is only 90 minutes long, so I feel as if they could have definitely spent more time with all of these relationships, instead of just having Woody tell us what was happening. And on top of all of this, while this is a beautiful film to look at, there is nothing new in this movie. It's another Woody Allen movie with the same romances and love triangles centered around white people who like jazz with a pretty inconclusive and unsatisfying ending.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":73899,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2016-08-05","keywords":"1930s,uncle,high class,older man younger woman marriage,reference to james cagney","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Café Society","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4197038105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJkMTAwYTMtMjkzOC00M2ZhLThlMDgtNWNiNjBkZTBkNTc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTJkMTAwYTMtMjkzOC00M2ZhLThlMDgtNWNiNjBkZTBkNTc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Café Society"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0251986/","name":"Jesse Eisenberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000095/","name":"Woody Allen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044777/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000605/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251858/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000095/","name":"Woody Allen"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Gabriel Julien-Laferriere was the director of 'We Are Family". He was born on February 9th, 1962. He is a French director, screenwriter, and assistant director, known for "SMS" (2014), "What's with this Granny" (2019), and "C'est quoi ce papy?!" (2021). He hasn't been nominated for any awards for his films because he is a small time French director. "We are family" didn't win any prizes. Gabriel Julien-Laferriere's net worth is.1.6 Million. We Are Family (C'est quoi cette famille?!) was shot in France inside of Hugo's (Elliott's Father) apartment during the 21st century. Bastien who was played by. Teilo azais was the main character in this movie. He was young, short, played the guitar and was close with his family. He was the one who had the idea of moving everyone into a huge apartment to become closer together. Throughout the movie their was also a love story between Bastien and the girl he met at school. The themes of this movie is that family's always stick together and small things bring family's closer together. In the beginning of the movie the parents didn't care about the kids as much and always went away on work trips and sent the kids to the other parents house. Throughout the movie though when all the siblings moved into one huge apartment, the parents grew closer with each other and with the kids. Overall, I enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend it to people who like light hearted comedy and enjoy family friendly movies! This movie is funny but also pulls at your heart strings.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1038,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-08-10","keywords":"14th birthday,video call,apartment,family relationships,stepfamily","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0310865/","name":"Julie Gayet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0627245/","name":"Thierry Neuvic"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0220017/","name":"Julie Depardieu"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0480768/","name":"Gabriel Julien-Laferrière"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136751/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065692/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0313479/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2492837/","name":"Camille Treiner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1930518/","name":"Olivier Treiner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1096212/","name":"François Desagnat"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Gabriel Julien-Laferriere was the director of 'We Are Family". He was born on February 9th, 1962. He is a French director, screenwriter, and assistant director, known for "SMS" (2014), "What's with this Granny" (2019), and "C'est quoi ce papy?!" (2021). He hasn't been nominated for any awards for his films because he is a small time French director. "We are family" didn't win any prizes. Gabriel Julien-Laferriere's net worth is.1.6 Million. We Are Family (C'est quoi cette famille?!) was shot in France inside of Hugo's (Elliott's Father) apartment during the 21st century. Bastien who was played by. Teilo azais was the main character in this movie. He was young, short, played the guitar and was close with his family. He was the one who had the idea of moving everyone into a huge apartment to become closer together. Throughout the movie their was also a love story between Bastien and the girl he met at school. The themes of this movie is that family's always stick together and small things bring family's closer together. In the beginning of the movie the parents didn't care about the kids as much and always went away on work trips and sent the kids to the other parents house. Throughout the movie though when all the siblings moved into one huge apartment, the parents grew closer with each other and with the kids. Overall, I enjoyed watching this movie and I recommend it to people who like light hearted comedy and enjoy family friendly movies! This movie is funny but also pulls at your heart strings.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1038,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-08-10","keywords":"14th birthday,video call,apartment,family relationships,stepfamily","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0310865/","name":"Julie Gayet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0627245/","name":"Thierry Neuvic","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0220017/","name":"Julie Depardieu"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0480768/","name":"Gabriel Julien-Laferrière"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065692/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0313479/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2492837/","name":"Camille Treiner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1930518/","name":"Olivier Treiner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1096212/","name":"François Desagnat"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There's no rhythm, not enough story, the acting is not what it should be. Was it an attempt to follow the fashion of history biopics of these last years? Fouquet, Molière, and now La Fontaine. But if his writings are forever famous, does his life deserves a movie? Judging from this one, I'd say not. Plus there are some annoying literary omissions. For instance, in this movie Jean de la Fontaine seems to discover the idea of talking animals, he gets inspiration by looking at animals and insects... Yet everybody knows, and he himself never denied it, that he was mostly inspired by the classic stories of Esope. He merely (yet brilliantly) modernized them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"genre":["Biography","History"],"datePublished":"2007-04-18","keywords":"louis xiv,poet,french history,france,french literature","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0222088/","name":"Lorànt Deutsch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868881/","name":"Philippe Torreton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271759/","name":"Sara Forestier"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0897045/","name":"Daniel Vigne"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079103/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0202971/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0286222/","name":"Jacques Forgeas"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There's no rhythm, not enough story, the acting is not what it should be. Was it an attempt to follow the fashion of history biopics of these last years? Fouquet, Molière, and now La Fontaine. But if his writings are forever famous, does his life deserves a movie? Judging from this one, I'd say not. Plus there are some annoying literary omissions. For instance, in this movie Jean de la Fontaine seems to discover the idea of talking animals, he gets inspiration by looking at animals and insects... Yet everybody knows, and he himself never denied it, that he was mostly inspired by the classic stories of Esope. He merely (yet brilliantly) modernized them.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"genre":["Biography","History"],"datePublished":"2007-04-18","keywords":"louis xiv,poet,french history,france,french literature","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0222088/","name":"Lorànt Deutsch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868881/","name":"Philippe Torreton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271759/","name":"Sara Forestier"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0897045/","name":"Daniel Vigne"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079103/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0202971/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0286222/","name":"Jacques Forgeas"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Superb animation, colorful characters and beautiful score. The storytelling is at an easy pace which differs from some other titles targeting the same audience but is highly appreciated by the kids at least in the theater where I saw the movie. The story is loosely based on the story of Robinson Crusoe by the book of Defoe. Earlier work from the same studio was pretty good as well but this one tops the former ones. Curious to see their next feature and nice to see that a small studio from Belgium makes films that can stand next to Pixar and DreamWorks. In short: great animation - go see it in 3D though - for kids and yes, parents will enjoy it as well.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Superb animation, colorful characters and beautiful score. The storytelling is at an easy pace which differs from some other titles targeting the same audience but is highly appreciated by the kids at least in the theater where I saw the movie. The story is loosely based on the story of Robinson Crusoe by the book of Defoe. Earlier work from the same studio was pretty good as well but this one tops the former ones. Curious to see their next feature and nice to see that a small studio from Belgium makes films that can stand next to Pixar and DreamWorks. In short: great animation - go see it in 3D though - for kids and yes, parents will enjoy it as well.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I am not sure if the success of the film is owed to the book it was adapted from or if the script added anything but the story was really engaging.\n\nThe funny and tragic moments never felt forced or embellished and the actors were extremely committed and convincing.\n\nI am not a viewer who knows too much about the film making process so the most I can comment on really is that whilst the ending was rather predictable I was happy I had watched the film and would highly recommend it to others.\n\nI hope the IMDb rating increases as it easily deserves 8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4919,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2010-09-24","keywords":"runaway slave,country estate,ghost,england,13 year old","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1375020/","name":"Alex Etel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001758/","name":"Timothy Spall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001749/","name":"Maggie Smith"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0271501/","name":"Julian Fellowes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040024/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0018857/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126667/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1569280/","name":"Lucy M.

It is starred by Mortadelo , a bald detective with pebble glasses and a long nose who usually wears a black frock coat , his real name comes from "mortadela", a kind of sausage . He is always fighting with Filemón , his partner, mostly because he tends to mess things up, usually to Filemon's discomfort . The latter , the leader of the two-man team, he is an educated man and an expert in a variety of fields . Then , it happens Jimmy el Cachondo and his henchmen have stolen a top secret document from the TIA headquarters that can ridicule them in front of all other spy agencies. The Superintendent will have no choice than to command the mission of retrieving it to Mortadelo and Filemón . To make matters worse, dangerous criminal Tronchamulas has escaped jail and plans to exact revenge on Filemón for arresting him in the past. Eventually they will be forced to team up to find Jimmy's hideout. Meanwhile, Professor Bacterio tries to help the pair of agents with his latest invention : the "reversicine", a beverage that turns people into the exact opposite of what they are or think . There also appears other personages such as ¨Ofelia¨ the fat and vain secretary of Superintendente Vicente . She is still single and would like to become involved with someone -usually with Mortadelo- , but so far her attempts have been in vain. She is quite touchy her lack of luck with a relationship and being called fat; she reacts with corresponding violence when either of topics are brought up and with her considerable weight, this is nothing to be ignored , she was the first female character created for the series . And the bombshell secretary of the Súper , Mortadelo and Philemon are in love with her -much to Ofelia's chagrin- , but she is not interested .\n\nGood 3D animation film , being well voiced by Janfri Mariano Venancio, Berta Ojea, Emilio Gavira, José Alias, José Manuel Moya José Marín , Janfri Topera played Profesor Bacterio , all of them appeared on the live action 2003 movie . This Computer Generator film , -the Second Ilion Animation Studios' Feature Film- packs thrills , action , comic situations , abstract incidents , at the same time satirizing Spanish society and many other things . After more than four decades entertaining through the comics, the most known couple of detectives are brought to life by means of 3D C.G.I . It was clear from the beginning the difficulty to transfer a cartoon comics to cinema ; however director Javier Fesser gets a charming rendition about our unforgettable memories of childhood and youth . This third adaptation to the cinema of the popular characters of Spanish comic of F.Ibáñez got a big box office similarly the first outing : ¨La Gran Aventura De Mortadelo Y Filemón¨(2003) also directed by Javier Fesser grossing more than 4,750,000 spectators and almost 22 million Euros . However , the second entry titled ¨Mortadelo y Filemón : Misión Salvar Tierra¨ by Miguel Bardem failed at Box office. \n\nAs always , our friend Mortadelo whose favourite hobby is wearing all sorts of sometimes outrageous disguises - professional and historical clothes and gear, animals, inanimate objects, even small-sized vehicles like miniature blimps and mopeds - which he mostly dons for special tasks or when he is on the run from Filemón or his boss, and which all include his signature collar which obscures part of his mouth . And of course , our best friend , Filemón , he only has two hairs on his head and wears a white shirt with a black bow-tie and red trousers. He usually insults Mort because Mort is quite clumsy, but is often at the receiving end of any mishaps which come their way, mostly in the shape of their outraged boss . Other important characters include : Vicente, he is usually called "El Súper" by his underlings . While he, as the head of the organization, lives in splendor, indulging himself in expensive beverages and Cuban cigars, he keeps the T.I.A.'s operatives on an extremely tight budget . He is very short-tempered and he usually gets angry with Mort and Phil because they fail in their missions , leaving a spectacular mess - occasionally at the expense of his own possessions . ¨Professor Bacterio¨ , the T.I.A.'s black-bearded scientist and chief inventor . Mortadelo blames him for his baldness and therefore the doctor is the unwilling prime recipient of Mort's practical jokes . His inventions, which are to assist Mortadelo and Philemon in their assignments, often fail quite spectacularly, mostly because they either achieve the opposite of what they are supposed to do, or work perfectly but fail at the most inconvenient moment , his name comes from bacteria . He holds a grudge against Mortadelo because he used to have lush hair until Bacterio offered him a supposed medicine against baldness, a new hair-strengthening concoction ,which actually made his hair fall out . Other main assets of this flick , along with a beloved tribute to other personages of Francisco Ibáñez as ¨Ofelia¨ nicely voiced by Berta Ojea and special appearance by sympathetic as well as absent-minded "Rompetechos" voiced by Emilio Gavira .\n\n¨Mortadelo Y Filemón Contra Jimmy El Cachondo¨won 29th Goya Awards : Best Adapted Screenplay Javier Fesser, Claro García and Cristóbal Ruiz and Won Best Animated Film , it achieved six Goya nominations and II Premios Feroz : Best Comedy Nominated Best Original Soundtrack Rafael Arnau","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1856,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"genre":["Animation","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-11-28","keywords":"criminal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi581745433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM1OTQ4OWEtZmMzZC00ZDkwLTk5MjUtNDU1NjI0ZWZmN2M0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM1OTQ4OWEtZmMzZC00ZDkwLTk5MjUtNDU1NjI0ZWZmN2M0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253216/","name":"Karra Elejalde"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0867653/","name":"Janfri Topera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2983652/","name":"Gabriel Chame"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275250/","name":"Javier Fesser"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208005/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0599932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0083985/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275250/","name":"Javier Fesser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2195290/","name":"Claro García"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1041385/","name":"Cristóbal Ruiz"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Finding himself lost and alone at Paddington Station, he meets the kindly Brown family, who offer him a temporary haven.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1109624/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"shawneofthedead"},"dateCreated":"2014-12-07","inLanguage":"English","name":"A bear necessity.","reviewBody":"There's plenty to be cynical about where Paddington is concerned. The first feature film about the iconic bear - red hat, blue coat, suitcase in hand - was first announced in 2007, and went through a gestation period that's extraordinarily long even for a heavily animated film. The trailer's (literal) toilet humour seemed to confirm that it was pitched firmly at kids. And last, but certainly not least, the cast experienced a shake-up of fairly seismic proportions when Colin Firth announced in July that - with the unanimous consent of all concerned - he would no longer be voicing Paddington. All signs pointed towards a disaster of a movie, one stitched together to cash in on rather than celebrate the phenomenon of Paddington, a little bear who has lived in books, TV series and cuddly merchandise around the world.\n\nIt's a flat-out joy to discover, then, that Paddington is very far from a disaster. Indeed, it's an unmitigated delight of a family film. Of course, "family films" don't really cater to everyone in the family a lot of the time - the phrase is a euphemism applied to movies that adults must put up with or suffer through for the sake of entertaining their children. But Paul King's Paddington, based on the beloved books by Michael Bond, really does have something for everyone and is, incidentally, an utterly lovely movie about families to boot. The young will be bowled over by the adorable bear who tumbles through London and into the hearts of his adopted family. The young at heart -and even a few older, crankier people - will find much to enjoy in the film's cheerfully subversive script.\n\nOur journey begins in Darkest Peru, where a young bear (voiced with pitch-perfect charm by Whishaw) lives happily with his Aunt Lucy (Staunton) and Uncle Pastuzo (Gambon). He inherits from them a healthy love for marmalade and London, as well as a floppy, red felt hat left behind decades ago by English explorer Montgomery Clyde (Downie). When an earthquake destroys their idyllic home, Aunt Lucy urges her nephew to strike out to London. Many jars of marmalade later, he finds himself in the iconic train station that gives him his name. He meets the Brown family: risk- averse Henry (Bonneville), dreamy Mary (Hawkins) and their children, Judy (Harris) and Jonathan (Joslin). With Henry insisting that Paddington can only stay while he looks for a more permanent home, the bear begins investigations in London - unaware that Millicent, an obsessive, possibly crazy taxidermist (Kidman), has very specific reasons for wanting him to visit her museum.\n\nStrictly speaking, there isn't anything all that new or original about Paddington. We've seen the trope many times before - in trying to find a new home, a misfit changes the hearts and minds of the people who will eventually become his family. The narrative of the film is also little more than a patchwork of wacky incidents and hijinks: Paddington floods the bathroom while trying to come to terms with the "facilities"; Paddington apprehends a criminal through sheer good luck and his incredibly honest nature; Paddington and Henry infiltrate the top-secret Geographers' Guild to hunt down Mr. Clyde.\n\nAnd yet, King has crafted something quite charming and magical around the bare bones of his story. The film practically radiates love for the sweet-tempered, unfailingly polite bear at its heart. A life-long fan of the ursine hero, King peppers his script with smart references to Bond's books, from Paddington's trademark 'hard stare', used to embarrass people into behaving better, through to the meddling interference of nosy, thrifty neighbour Mr. Curry (Capaldi). He's also updated and deepened the story to give the elder Browns their own emotional arc: Mary's determination to open her heart and home to a stranger is what eventually leads Henry to getting back in touch with his wilder, more fun-loving side. The film also looks quite spectacular, whether Paddington is surfing down a flight of stairs in a bathtub or we're allowed a dollhouse glimpse at the Brown family as they go about their lives.\n\nMost importantly, King infuses the entire film with a practically joyous strain of comedy and wit. Pratfalls and sight gags are accompanied by deliciously silly allusions to William Shakespeare and Mission Impossible. Even the film's supporting characters get their own hefty share of comedy, whether it's housekeeper Mrs Bird (Walters) distracting a security guard by means of a booze throwdown or Mr. Curry falling instantly for Millicent to a smooth burst of Lionel Richie. Millicent herself is an inspired creation. Prowling through the film, togged out in figure-hugging snakeskin and wielding scalpels, she brings to mind and subverts the icy-cool blonde archetype most beloved of Alfred Hitchcock.\n\nThe sharp script and stunning visuals would mean little without a cast wholly committed to their roles, and King has struck gold with his offbeat casting choices. Bonneville, a veteran of Downton Abbey, has no problem playing Henry's constant anxiety over his children, but also gleefully flings propriety to the winds as he slips into tunic and apron for a spot of howlingly funny undercover business. Hawkins lends Mary - the loving, tender heart of the household and Paddington's biggest champion - a soulful gravitas. Great as they are, however, the MVP here is Kidman. Her fantastically manic performance as Millicent reminds us why it's a damn shame that she hasn't been in a comedy for years - she's so cheerfully unhinged in the film that she steals pretty much every scene she's in.\n\nIt doesn't matter whether you're a fan of Bond's books, someone who only knows Paddington as a cuddly soft toy, or a neophyte who has never heard of this walking, talking, marmalade-loving bear. Paddington is a big, warm bear hug of a film, one that will enchant children and tickle adults, even as it grabs just about everyone by the heart with its charm and humour.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104941,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-11-28","keywords":"bear,paddington station london,talking bear,taxidermist,title spoken by character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi706391833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MjkxMDM5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTkyNzgzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MjkxMDM5MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTkyNzgzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young English boy befriends a talking bear he finds at a London train station.

But "OSS 117 -Le Caire nid d'espions" and its sequel "OSS 117 Rio ne répond plus" fare much better than "Imogène McCarthery, despite the latter's excellent cast (Lambert Wilson, Michel Aumont, Danièle Lebrun, Lionel Abelanski and the three funny actors who play the Soviet spies, Francis Leplay, Nicolas Vaude and Pierre Laplace) and its satisfying natural and artificial settings. What makes the two former films superior to "Imogène" is that they are not content to tell their (superficial) story, they also play on the stereotypes of the B or Z-films of the period the action is set in. OSS 117 is a self-centered, racist chauvinist and does not realise it, whereas we spectators are aware of it Thus we laugh at the fool while, by extension, these human flaws are denounced. In "Imogène", on the contrary, you are asked to be complicit with the title character, who has similar foibles (she is an unrepentant Scottish nationalist, and base all of her behavior on this stiff principle, generating an endless series of repetitive gags). As a result, if you disapprove of ultra nationalism, you will not really have a ball watching Catherine Frot always criticizing the English and the Welsh or breaking her engagement just because her fiancé is too ... tolerant! "Imogène McCarthery" is the first film directed by Franck Magnier and Alexandre Charlot, who once wrote for the famous satiric TV show "Les Guignols de l'Info". Their texts were incisive and biting. They seem to have lost their edge here.Let's hope this is only temporary.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":333,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"genre":["Comedy","Crime","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-05-05","keywords":"character name as title,two word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi100710937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRhMGRjZTctZjYyZC00ODI0LTgyMjQtOTM4YzJhYzMwMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRhMGRjZTctZjYyZC00ODI0LTgyMjQtOTM4YzJhYzMwMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296594/","name":"Catherine Frot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933727/","name":"Lambert Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0495947/","name":"Danièle Lebrun"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0153265/","name":"Alexandre Charlot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536251/","name":"Franck Magnier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066227/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190552/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0264033/","name":"Charles Exbrayat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0153265/","name":"Alexandre Charlot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536251/","name":"Franck Magnier"}],"duration":"PT1H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What makes the two former films superior to "Imogène" is that they are not content to tell their (superficial) story, they also play on the stereotypes of the B or Z-films of the period the action is set in. OSS 117 is a self-centered, racist chauvinist and does not realise it, whereas we spectators are aware of it Thus we laugh at the fool while, by extension, these human flaws are denounced. In "Imogène", on the contrary, you are asked to be complicit with the title character, who has similar foibles (she is an unrepentant Scottish nationalist, and base all of her behavior on this stiff principle, generating an endless series of repetitive gags). As a result, if you disapprove of ultra nationalism, you will not really have a ball watching Catherine Frot always criticizing the English and the Welsh or breaking her engagement just because her fiancé is too ... tolerant! "Imogène McCarthery" is the first film directed by Franck Magnier and Alexandre Charlot, who once wrote for the famous satiric TV show "Les Guignols de l'Info". Their texts were incisive and biting. They seem to have lost their edge here.Let's hope this is only temporary.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":333,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Comedy","Crime","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-05-05","keywords":"character name as title,two word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi100710937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRhMGRjZTctZjYyZC00ODI0LTgyMjQtOTM4YzJhYzMwMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTRhMGRjZTctZjYyZC00ODI0LTgyMjQtOTM4YzJhYzMwMmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296594/","name":"Catherine Frot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933727/","name":"Lambert Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0495947/","name":"Danièle Lebrun"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0153265/","name":"Alexandre Charlot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536251/","name":"Franck Magnier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066227/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190552/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0264033/","name":"Charles Exbrayat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0153265/","name":"Alexandre Charlot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536251/","name":"Franck Magnier"],"duration":"PT1H22M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Vincent Lindon and Gilles Lellouche together in a thriller with real tough scenes, I jumped on this must see ... and I wasn't disappointed at all.\n\nAnd the movie begins very hard, and it goes on like this till the end : lot of twists and surprises all along the movie, with physical strength and action packed sequences.

Marvel Studios has become a juggernaut that seemingly nothing can ever stop. When The Incredible Hulk came out in 2008, the second movie of the so-called « Phase 1 » after Iron Man, such a success was merely a hope, if it was envisaged at all.\n\nHowever, this movie is an oddity in the MCU. It isn't considered an essential watch, a lot of people just forget about it, or simply have never seen it. And this isn't very suprising, as The Incredible Hulk has a completely different feel as any other MCU movie. There are no vibrant colors, jokes are few and far between, and, supreme heresy, it doesn't even feature the beloved Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner / the Hulk. Despite that, I think this movie should be more recognized by Marvel enthusiasts.\n\nFor one, I was surprised at the number of foreshadowing in it. Despite its reputation, it is very clear, watching now, that it was definitely intended as the beginning of a cinematic universe. There are references to Stark Industries, to super soldiers, to S.H.I.E.L.D., and the movie clearly lays the ground for a sequel (that never happened and probably never will).\n\nThe performances were strong, and I will single out Edward Norton, who left the Marvel boat after this, for reasons still a bit unclear. Watching this movie made me regret that he didn't stay in the role for more movies (no disrespect to Mr. Ruffalo whom I like a lot, as does everyone). I am a big fan of Edward Norton in general, from whom I have never seen an unenjoyable performance. That stays true for this movie. To me, his casting as Bruce Banner was an inspired one. He portrayed the tortured soul of the character exactly as I envision it, and with a lot of nuances.\n\nThe story itself isn't very remarkable. It's fairly conventional, although maybe not totally conventional for a superhero movie. I would say it's more of a thriller, about a man on the run from the military who are after his secrets and his life. We've seen this story before, but here the man also happens to turn into a big, green monster when his pulse gets too high. It isn't just a thriller, though, bu also very much a love story, which may be one of the reasons of its unpopularity (?). If that's the case, then it's a shame, because I found the love story actually well done. There was a real chemistry between Edward Norton and Liv Tyler, who portrayed a sweet, but capable Betty Ross, and there wasn't a moment where I didn't believe that these two characters were completely in love.\n\nWhat this movie might be criticized for, is a lack of the titular Hulk. It's true that it's mainly Banner's story. However, the scenes in which the Hulk appears are very satisfying. I must say I was impressed by the CGI. It isn't as modern as what we're used to see nowadays, but still very good. In a movie with such a realistic feel, it's even more difficult to make a huge CGI monster look like it's really there in the scene, but I though that it worked perfectly.\n\nThis movie definitely is the odd one out in regards to the whole MCU, but I think it deserves not to be forgotten or dismissed. Not only is its quality on par with other, more popular Marvel movies, it is also our only Hulk solo movie, and it will stay so for the foreseeable future, due to the distribution deal between Marvel and Universal. So, if you're taking a nostalgia trip through the history of the MCU, or if you're only just now starting to delve into this cinematic universe, don't skip the Incredible Hulk.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":454685,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2008-06-18","keywords":"marvel cinematic universe,based on comic,bruce banner character,reboot of series,scene during opening credits","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Incredible Hulk: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1726152985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second trailer for The Incredible Hulk, directed by Louis Leterrier."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000239/","name":"Liv Tyler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672015/","name":"Zak Penn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456158/","name":"Jack Kirby"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It wouldn't be the last time, however, that the portrayal was an exaggeration of coprolalia (the swearing tic), the shock value of which was used for a cheap and easy laugh.\n\nOver the years, I've seen that many people have presumptions about this neurological disorder - understandable, given the circumstances. Unfortunately, I've also learned the hard way that many of these presumptions have been heavily (and negatively) biased towards this inferred 'swearing tic', and I can't help but feel like Deuce Bigalow, or Not Another Teen Movie, or others, have helped shape this presumption.\n\nThe presumption honestly doesn't bother me, provided the person holding the belief is willing to have a conversation with me about it. I've always been open about my Tourette, and I consider myself lucky and fortunate to have won awards, or spoken with the media, or inspired others, due to my openness and having some small success with writing and acting.\n\nWhat does get to me, though, is when the people aren't willing to have a conversation with me. I've been fired from jobs once it's become known that I have Tourette, even though it hasn't affected my work. I've had dates suddenly lose interest. I've been kicked out of bars when bouncers have mistaken my tics for drug use and refused to hear any explanation without threatening violence.\n\nSo when I heard that Edward Norton would be portraying someone with Tourette Syndrome in #MotherlessBrooklyn, I was excited to see what an actor of such calibre would do with such a complex condition. And I was not disappointed.\n\nMotherless Brooklyn is great. Adapted from the novel and written and directed for the screen by Edward himself, the film is an enthralling and charming noir detective piece peppered with big names playing relatively small roles, all of whom tell a captivating story about government corruption in 1950s New York.\n\nEdward's presentation of Tourette Syndrome was refreshing. It was delivered with a level of maturity and respect that is seldom seen on the silver screen. And even though the condition is never outright named in the film, much like his tics, it can't be hidden from anyone watching.\n\nAnd yes, his character does have coprolalia, and echolalia (the tic where you have to repeat things said), and other verbal and motor tics. And sometimes it's funny. But his tics aren't just a cheap laugh for the audience - they affect his character. A PI trying to stay unnoticed on the subway who suddenly blurts out some choice words and draws attention to himself is funny. And when he's consoling someone and can't stop touching their shoulder, it's funny. And when they reassure him that it's okay, it's endearing.\n\nAnd it's okay for us to laugh at the realities of life, however absurd or uncontrollable they may be at times. Tourette Syndrome is real and sometimes it's funny and that's okay. But at least in this film, we're finally laughing at it for the right reasons. And with his portrayal, which also shows some of the positives that can come with Tourette - as opposed to just the obviously stare-inducing drawbacks - I am hopeful that this may help provide the less-aware with a better, more informed presumption about this condition.\n\nAre there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and who are open about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. Like me. But I'm not Edward Norton. And are there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and closeted about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. But they are also not Edward Norton.\n\nThe issue of roles going to actors who don't live with the condition being portrayed has been a hot-button issue for many, and I do think there are instances where the role should have gone to someone else. This isn't one of those times. Actors are actors, after all - their job is to convince you that they're not pretending.\n\nEdward was convincing. And I - and I imagine a number of others with Tourette Syndrome who have been subject to unfair or illegal treatment due, at least in part, to a sub-par late '90s movie - thank him for being so. I was fortunate enough to see this at TIFF this year, where he introduced the film. Had he stayed for a Q&amp;A afterwards, I would have loved to have said this to him in person. But I doubt I am the first, and know I won't be the last, person to say this.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":47271,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It wouldn't be the last time, however, that the portrayal was an exaggeration of coprolalia (the swearing tic), the shock value of which was used for a cheap and easy laugh.\n\nOver the years, I've seen that many people have presumptions about this neurological disorder - understandable, given the circumstances. Unfortunately, I've also learned the hard way that many of these presumptions have been heavily (and negatively) biased towards this inferred 'swearing tic', and I can't help but feel like Deuce Bigalow, or Not Another Teen Movie, or others, have helped shape this presumption.\n\nThe presumption honestly doesn't bother me, provided the person holding the belief is willing to have a conversation with me about it. I've always been open about my Tourette, and I consider myself lucky and fortunate to have won awards, or spoken with the media, or inspired others, due to my openness and having some small success with writing and acting.\n\nWhat does get to me, though, is when the people aren't willing to have a conversation with me. I've been fired from jobs once it's become known that I have Tourette, even though it hasn't affected my work. I've had dates suddenly lose interest. I've been kicked out of bars when bouncers have mistaken my tics for drug use and refused to hear any explanation without threatening violence.\n\nSo when I heard that Edward Norton would be portraying someone with Tourette Syndrome in #MotherlessBrooklyn, I was excited to see what an actor of such calibre would do with such a complex condition. And I was not disappointed.\n\nMotherless Brooklyn is great. Adapted from the novel and written and directed for the screen by Edward himself, the film is an enthralling and charming noir detective piece peppered with big names playing relatively small roles, all of whom tell a captivating story about government corruption in 1950s New York.\n\nEdward's presentation of Tourette Syndrome was refreshing. It was delivered with a level of maturity and respect that is seldom seen on the silver screen. And even though the condition is never outright named in the film, much like his tics, it can't be hidden from anyone watching.\n\nAnd yes, his character does have coprolalia, and echolalia (the tic where you have to repeat things said), and other verbal and motor tics. And sometimes it's funny. But his tics aren't just a cheap laugh for the audience - they affect his character. A PI trying to stay unnoticed on the subway who suddenly blurts out some choice words and draws attention to himself is funny. And when he's consoling someone and can't stop touching their shoulder, it's funny. And when they reassure him that it's okay, it's endearing.\n\nAnd it's okay for us to laugh at the realities of life, however absurd or uncontrollable they may be at times. Tourette Syndrome is real and sometimes it's funny and that's okay. But at least in this film, we're finally laughing at it for the right reasons. And with his portrayal, which also shows some of the positives that can come with Tourette - as opposed to just the obviously stare-inducing drawbacks - I am hopeful that this may help provide the less-aware with a better, more informed presumption about this condition.\n\nAre there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and who are open about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. Like me. But I'm not Edward Norton. And are there actors out there with Tourette Syndrome (and closeted about it) that could have played this role? Absolutely. But they are also not Edward Norton.\n\nThe issue of roles going to actors who don't live with the condition being portrayed has been a hot-button issue for many, and I do think there are instances where the role should have gone to someone else. This isn't one of those times. Actors are actors, after all - their job is to convince you that they're not pretending.\n\nEdward was convincing. And I - and I imagine a number of others with Tourette Syndrome who have been subject to unfair or illegal treatment due, at least in part, to a sub-par late '90s movie - thank him for being so. I was fortunate enough to see this at TIFF this year, where he introduced the film. Had he stayed for a Q&amp;A afterwards, I would have loved to have said this to him in person. But I doubt I am the first, and know I won't be the last, person to say this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":47271,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sam (Nicholas D'Agosto) is an aspirant chef and his girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell) has just ended their relationship, since he intends to take an internship in culinary art in France. While crossing a suspension- bridge that is in maintenance, Sam has a vision where everybody in the bus including him dies after the bridge collapsing. Sam asks the driver to open the door and he leaves the bus with Molly. \n\nHis friend Peter Friedkin (Miles Fisher) and his girlfriend Candice Hooper (Ellen Wroe) follow Sam and Molly asking them to return to the bus. Olivia Castle (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood), Isaac Palmer (P.J. Byrne), Nathan (Arlen Escarpeta) and their boss Dennis Lapman (David Koechner ) also leave the bus. When the bridge collapses, they all do not die. The Federal Agent Jim Block (Courtney B. Vance) suspects of Sam, but sooner he receives the technical report concluding that the bridge collapsed due to natural causes (wind). \n\nDuring the funeral of their friends, a creepy man tells to Sam that death does not like to be cheated. Sooner Candice, Isaac and Olivia die in a stranger way and Sam recalls that the survivors are dying in the sequence that they had originally died. The next victim would be Nathan, but he accidentally causes the death of the rebel worker Roy. The survivors learn that if they trade spots with another victim, they receive the years left in the live of the victim. \n\nWhen I see the franchise "Final Destination, I know exactly what I am going to see: a group of teenagers escaping from death in a first moment and then death chases each one of them since the storyline is always the same. \n\n"Final Destination 5" has excellent CGI and very creative deaths and never disappoints; therefore the intention of the director is accomplished. The sequence with the collapse of the bridge is very impressive. The acting is also good and in the end I liked this film. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Premonição 5" ("Premonition 5")","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110252,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-08-12","keywords":"suspension bridge,gymnast,death of protagonist,eyeball run over by car,fall out window","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3590233113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Survivors of a suspension bridge collapse frantically work together to try and outwit Death and its sinister agenda."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194900/","name":"Nicholas D'Agosto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068187/","name":"Emma Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0260224/","name":"Arlen Escarpeta"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702797/","name":"Steven Quale"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0236019/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2104063/","name":"Eric Heisserer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714695/","name":"Jeffrey Reddick"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Sam (Nicholas D'Agosto) is an aspirant chef and his girlfriend Molly (Emma Bell) has just ended their relationship, since he intends to take an internship in culinary art in France. While crossing a suspension- bridge that is in maintenance, Sam has a vision where everybody in the bus including him dies after the bridge collapsing. Sam asks the driver to open the door and he leaves the bus with Molly. \n\nHis friend Peter Friedkin (Miles Fisher) and his girlfriend Candice Hooper (Ellen Wroe) follow Sam and Molly asking them to return to the bus. Olivia Castle (Jacqueline MacInnes Wood), Isaac Palmer (P.J. Byrne), Nathan (Arlen Escarpeta) and their boss Dennis Lapman (David Koechner ) also leave the bus. When the bridge collapses, they all do not die. The Federal Agent Jim Block (Courtney B. Vance) suspects of Sam, but sooner he receives the technical report concluding that the bridge collapsed due to natural causes (wind). \n\nDuring the funeral of their friends, a creepy man tells to Sam that death does not like to be cheated. Sooner Candice, Isaac and Olivia die in a stranger way and Sam recalls that the survivors are dying in the sequence that they had originally died. The next victim would be Nathan, but he accidentally causes the death of the rebel worker Roy. The survivors learn that if they trade spots with another victim, they receive the years left in the live of the victim. \n\nWhen I see the franchise "Final Destination, I know exactly what I am going to see: a group of teenagers escaping from death in a first moment and then death chases each one of them since the storyline is always the same. \n\n"Final Destination 5" has excellent CGI and very creative deaths and never disappoints; therefore the intention of the director is accomplished. The sequence with the collapse of the bridge is very impressive. The acting is also good and in the end I liked this film. My vote is seven.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Premonição 5" ("Premonition 5")","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110252,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-08-12","keywords":"suspension bridge,gymnast,death of protagonist,eyeball run over by car,fall out window","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3590233113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Survivors of a suspension bridge collapse frantically work together to try and outwit Death and its sinister agenda.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194900/","name":"Nicholas D'Agosto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068187/","name":"Emma Bell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0260224/","name":"Arlen Escarpeta"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702797/","name":"Steven Quale"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0236019/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2104063/","name":"Eric Heisserer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714695/","name":"Jeffrey Reddick"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!\n\nDirector, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson &amp; Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth! \n\nIn the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of "Super-Star". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do so What a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!) \n\nOn the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already aware audiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .\n\nFor my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .\n\nTo highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .\n\nBefore rushing out to see it, just a little warning.

IMO there were a couple poignant moments of sadness, but dont want to share too much. But mostly, I think it was hilarious ! Those actors are amazing. The style of the film making and the humor is beautiful, down to earth, funny and very touching.

I have loved all of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, including his greatly underrated Punch-Drunk Love, but this is a huge leap from any of the previous movies into a realm, as others have said, inhabited by classics such as Treasure of the Sierra Madre - and then some. Every element of this film is astonishing, from the opening twenty minutes, which feature virtually no dialog, to Jonny Greenwood's score, which I have heard criticized as too imposing but which seems just about perfect to me (and brings to mind the non-Blue Danube elements of 2001 at its most experimental).

I have loved all of Paul Thomas Anderson's work, including his greatly underrated Punch-Drunk Love, but this is a huge leap from any of the previous movies into a realm, as others have said, inhabited by classics such as Treasure of the Sierra Madre - and then some. Every element of this film is astonishing, from the opening twenty minutes, which feature virtually no dialog, to Jonny Greenwood's score, which I have heard criticized as too imposing but which seems just about perfect to me (and brings to mind the non-Blue Danube elements of 2001 at its most experimental). Daniel Day-Lewis' performance is in a league of its own: his voice, his mannerisms, his physical movement, his stunted emotions, are flesh and blood, and hauntingly so, in a way that even Tommy Lee Jones in In The Valley of Elah (which I thought was a pretty staggering performance) can't quite attain.

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Easy enough, but, unbeknownst to Earl, he's just signed on as a drug courier for a Mexican cartel.

The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. \n\nTaking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.\n\nA film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.   \n\nUnlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.

There she meets Stéphane, a conman who desperately needs money... and from then on, the plot evolves into a delightful love story where Franssou tries to con Stéphane into admitting he's in love with her. \n\nThe dialogues were amazing and served by the acting: José Garcia was wonderful in his role - sure of himself and macho when conning people while sometimes completely baffled when faced with Carré's cheeky Franssou; Cluzet's René... I can't even begin to define how much the character made me laugh. The use of a few running jokes (René's obsession with cars, the Asiatic tourists at the hotel) didn't hamper the movie but indeed made it even more enjoyable and I can't help but find the writing truly wonderful. Another plus is Luis Rego's role in the movie - the man is always funny.\n\nTo address some of the other commenter's criticism, I'd like to say that: 1) While the movie does work with the same theme great American comedies of the 50's do, it uses their basic premise and works on it to achieve something different and new which, IMHO, is worth seeing. 2) Re: Mr Bowen's idea that because Stéphane is French-Arab, the movie is a parable for... well, he doesn't actually say, but apparently it's bad. I'm amused by that reaction because Stéphane's ancestry is not a plot-point in the movie - indeed it is not mentioned at all, which makes me wonder how he got "French-Arab" from an actor of Spanish decent. The film is a romantic comedy, stop trying to see metaphors on society in it.\n\nThis movie is basically good, light-hearted fun.

And while I think thats true, I think its a bit more complex than that. It also is a bit of a coming of age story where Joe has to grow up and be the adult in this family, but also it seems that mom is having a mid-life crisis (although shes not quite mid-life) and trying to discover who she is outside of being the "perfect 50s housewife" that perhaps she feels trapped in. There's a lot of symbolism in this movie. The backdrop of this movie is that there is a wildfire that has been raging and the townspeople have been desperately trying to put out. And that correlates with Joe and his own family. Hes trying to put out the fire in his own family. Also, Joe works at photography studio and Paul Dano (the director and co-writer) even said that this is supposed to be a PORTRAIT of a family life. \n\nSpeaking of Paul Dano, I think he did well with his directorial debut. I think visually there are some gorgeous shots in this movie. Like for instance where Joe is watching the wildfires (and hes perfectly centered - probably again to mimic the portrait vibe). Also where Joe is about to give up but it starts to snow and hope has regained. I liked the film for the most part. They do frame the film by following Joe's perspective. And I think its mostly effective in making you feel for this kid, my only problem is there are a couple of parts where I feel like there are gaps in the story. Without giving too much away there is a scene where Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal) has decided to seek revenge and it ends up backfiring. And yet, the next time we see him everything seems to be fine. And it never really gets explained what happened. Theres a brief line that they decided it was a "misunderstanding" but you never really see what happened and he also gets hurt during this, and that never gets brought up again either. I know Paul and Zoe (the other writer) were adapting this from a book and perhaps thats the way it is in there too. But I personally found that a little frustrating. I needed a little more. \n\nCarey Mulligan is fantastic in this. She would be deserving to have her name thrown in the hat for awards season. I also thought Ed Oxenbould was a standout too. Which is good to hear since he's onscreen for pretty much most of the movie. I definitely will be looking forward to more of his things. I also thought Jake Gyllenhaal was good but hes absent for a good chunk of the film and so he just didnt stand out as much as Carey or Ed did.\n\nOverall I liked the film. It wasn't perfect, but I would totally check out another film that Paul Dano directs.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26616,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-01-01","keywords":"1960s,unemployment,photography,infidelity,firefighter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1986312985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A boy witnesses his parents' marriage falling apart after his mother finds another man."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590837/","name":"Ed Oxenbould"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0585931/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0564372/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625497/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1443740/","name":"Zoe Kazan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285840/","name":"Richard Ford"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And while I think thats true, I think its a bit more complex than that. It also is a bit of a coming of age story where Joe has to grow up and be the adult in this family, but also it seems that mom is having a mid-life crisis (although shes not quite mid-life) and trying to discover who she is outside of being the "perfect 50s housewife" that perhaps she feels trapped in. There's a lot of symbolism in this movie. The backdrop of this movie is that there is a wildfire that has been raging and the townspeople have been desperately trying to put out. And that correlates with Joe and his own family. Hes trying to put out the fire in his own family. Also, Joe works at photography studio and Paul Dano (the director and co-writer) even said that this is supposed to be a PORTRAIT of a family life. \n\nSpeaking of Paul Dano, I think he did well with his directorial debut. I think visually there are some gorgeous shots in this movie. Like for instance where Joe is watching the wildfires (and hes perfectly centered - probably again to mimic the portrait vibe). Also where Joe is about to give up but it starts to snow and hope has regained. I liked the film for the most part. They do frame the film by following Joe's perspective. And I think its mostly effective in making you feel for this kid, my only problem is there are a couple of parts where I feel like there are gaps in the story. Without giving too much away there is a scene where Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal) has decided to seek revenge and it ends up backfiring. And yet, the next time we see him everything seems to be fine. And it never really gets explained what happened. Theres a brief line that they decided it was a "misunderstanding" but you never really see what happened and he also gets hurt during this, and that never gets brought up again either. I know Paul and Zoe (the other writer) were adapting this from a book and perhaps thats the way it is in there too. But I personally found that a little frustrating. I needed a little more. \n\nCarey Mulligan is fantastic in this. She would be deserving to have her name thrown in the hat for awards season. I also thought Ed Oxenbould was a standout too. Which is good to hear since he's onscreen for pretty much most of the movie. I definitely will be looking forward to more of his things. I also thought Jake Gyllenhaal was good but hes absent for a good chunk of the film and so he just didnt stand out as much as Carey or Ed did.\n\nOverall I liked the film. It wasn't perfect, but I would totally check out another film that Paul Dano directs.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26616,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-01-01","keywords":"1960s,unemployment,photography,infidelity,firefighter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1986312985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A boy witnesses his parents' marriage falling apart after his mother finds another man.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590837/","name":"Ed Oxenbould","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0585931/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0564372/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625497/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1443740/","name":"Zoe Kazan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285840/","name":"Richard Ford"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The vacationers include the Mossbacher family - Nicole (Connie Britton), a successful type-A exec, who can't help but treat her family like disobedient employees; her husband, Mark (Steve Zahn), dealing with both an embarrassing health crisis and a terminal inferiority complex; their teenaged son, Quinn (Fred Hechinger), a socially awkward gamer, experiencing the wonder of nature for the very first time; their daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and her friend, Paula (Brittany O'Grady), sharp-tongued college sophomores who cast a sardonic eye on the lifestyles and belief systems of everyone around them.  The handsome, entitled Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) is here with his beautiful bride, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario).  Shane and Rachel are in the throes of young love, but as they get to know each other better in this new, intimate environment, clouds of doubt appear - and by the time Shane's intrusive mother, Kitty (Molly Shannon) surprises them with an unwelcome visit, their fairytale honeymoon has begun to unravel. And finally, there is Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy, unstable woman, recovering from the death of her mother, traveling alone to the hotel, looking for love and in desperate need of a massage."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's definitely one of the most depressing films I've ever seen.\n\nManchester by the Sea tells the story of a depressed man named Lee who has to take care of his brother's son after his unfortunate death.\n\nThis is not a film that you go to watch for a good time. Manchester by the Sea made me feel really sad throughout the entirety of it and it's mainly done through the amazing performances and level of authenticity writer-director Kenneth Lonergan creates. This film is very simple. It's not stylish in any way and Lonergan's script maintains the realism through the runtime. At no point did I think there were actors playing the characters because the performances and conversations they were all having seemed too real. This made Lonergan's story about guilt, pain and depression more impactful and heartbreaking.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a career best performance by Casey Affleck. It's a performance that's rather sombre instead of flashy. His facial expressions are very subtle but you can still tell how broken and unhappy of a man he is. When you first see his character, you tend to dislike him but after finding out the reason why he's so miserable, you root for him and want him to recover from his depressive state. Michelle Williams isn't in the film much but she's brilliant in all the scenes she's present in. I thought Lucas Hedges was good but there were times where I found his accent quite jarring and a scene where he cries didn't seem too realistic.\n\nIt's best going into Manchester by the Sea not knowing much as I feel it makes the film more poignant.

Camera!  Action!  What makes a good movie?  Better yet, what makes a great movie?  In my opinion, a great movie should include almost flawless acting, a finely woven and gripping plot, music that is both beautiful and suitable, and great direction. Of course,  mesmerizing visuals and art direction can also contribute to great films.  So, for all the reasons above, I consider "The City Of Lost Children" the best film of 1996.\n\nThe plot of "The City Of Lost Children" is completely original and it never lets your mind wander off to other places.  It also involves quite a few fascinating and somewhat weird characters in a dreary harbor town called "The City Of Lost Children" (hence the title).   One(that is his name) is a slow-minded circus strongman who searches for his adopted little brother who has been kidnapped by a group of henchmen with robotic eyes called the Cyclops.  One's little brother has been kidnapped and taken to a quickly aging mad scientist named Krank so that his dreams may be stolen.  The mad scientist needs the dreams of children so that he will not age so quickly. The source of this problem is a curse that was put upon him.  Because of this curse, his wife is a midget, he cannot dream, and he has seven identical sons (all of whom have a strange sleeping disorder).  In this movie there is somewhat of a subplot that involves a wicked pair of unseparated siamese twin sisters.  These women run a sort of school where they have the children in it steal for them.  One small, but tough, girl named Miette runs away from the school, finds One, and aides him in his search.  When the two women find out about their little thief, they go to Marcello, a retired man who used to run a circus freakshow, to get what they need to catch and kill the little girl and her newfound friend.  Although this plot seems a bit hard to follow, it all fits together perfectly in the end with wondrous results.  To accompany this odd story,  there is a beautiful soundtrack composed by Angelo Badalmenti with one song ("Who Will Take Your Dreams Away") by Marianne Faithful.  This music fits the mood and plot of the story perfectly and stays with you(as does the movie itself) long after the credits have rolled.\n\nThe casting director of "The City Of Lost Children", Pierre-Jacques Benochou, sure knew what he was doing, because there is not one poor (or mediocre one, for that matter) performance in the whole film.  In fact, I might just say all the performances were virtually flawless.  Ron Perlman's performance as the slow and dimwitted circus strongman One is beautifully acted.  Mr. Perlman should especially be recognized because he is an American actor and this is a subtitled French film.  Daniel Emilfork as the depressed and dreamless mad scientist with a short temper is outstanding and most believable.  Dominique Pinon is wonderful (perhaps the best actor in the whole movie) as the seven rubberfaced identical brothers (yes, he does play all of them, and with fantastic results, too).  The two different actresses who portray the siamese twins, Odile Mallet and Genevieve Brunet, are perfectly wicked and their timing is impeccable.  Last, but not least, the children, with Judith Vittet as Miette in a stand-out performance, all carry out their roles with smashing results.\n\nAnother reason for me choosing "The City Of Lost Children" as the best movie of 1996 is its stunning direction.  This movie was directed by the famous French directing team of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro(a.k.a. "Jeunet and Caro").  The camera angles that are used during the course of this film are a totally different experience and they keep you mesmerized from start to finish.  The directors of this film are, in my opinion, masters of the camera.  The visuals in this movie also contributed to my conclusion that this is the best movie of 1996.  Whatever it might have been, whether the bleak and unique use of colors or the special effects, I was absolutely captivated by what I was seeing on the screen.  What I particularly liked about this film's special effects was that they were not the typical flashy and in-your-face computer special effects that some of today's blockbusters and other genre films seem to have.  I think such special effects distract you from the rest of the movie.  On the contrary, the special effects of "The City Of Lost Children," however, are very subtle.  A final thing I liked about this film were its sets.  From the waterlogged streets of the dank and moldy town to the spectacular gadgetry of Krank's laboratories everything was a magnificent panorama for the eye to behold.\n\nWas the plot great?  Yes.  How was the acting?  Outstanding.  Was the direction done well?  Definitely.  How did the visuals appear?  They were beautifully presented.  From what you have read, whether you have concluded to avoid this movie completely or go out and rent it right away (I do understand that this movie does have a select audience), I am hopeful that you understand the picture I am trying to paint.  Even if the story will not appeal to you, it is still splendidly done.  Overall, though, "The City Of Lost Children" is definitely the best movie of 1996 for me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66486,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1995-05-17","keywords":"psychotronic film,underwater scene,children,dream,aging","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The City of Lost Children","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4236902681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlkNTAzY2MtNmVjYS00Mzk5LWJlNGYtNzI1N2JhZDgwMmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlkNTAzY2MtNmVjYS00Mzk5LWJlNGYtNzI1N2JhZDgwMmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256399/","name":"Daniel Emilfork"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900136/","name":"Judith Vittet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054943/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0545615/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012496/","name":"Gilles Adrien"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Camera!  Action!  What makes a good movie?  Better yet, what makes a great movie?  In my opinion, a great movie should include almost flawless acting, a finely woven and gripping plot, music that is both beautiful and suitable, and great direction. Of course,  mesmerizing visuals and art direction can also contribute to great films.  So, for all the reasons above, I consider "The City Of Lost Children" the best film of 1996.\n\nThe plot of "The City Of Lost Children" is completely original and it never lets your mind wander off to other places.  It also involves quite a few fascinating and somewhat weird characters in a dreary harbor town called "The City Of Lost Children" (hence the title).   One(that is his name) is a slow-minded circus strongman who searches for his adopted little brother who has been kidnapped by a group of henchmen with robotic eyes called the Cyclops.  One's little brother has been kidnapped and taken to a quickly aging mad scientist named Krank so that his dreams may be stolen.  The mad scientist needs the dreams of children so that he will not age so quickly. The source of this problem is a curse that was put upon him.  Because of this curse, his wife is a midget, he cannot dream, and he has seven identical sons (all of whom have a strange sleeping disorder).  In this movie there is somewhat of a subplot that involves a wicked pair of unseparated siamese twin sisters.  These women run a sort of school where they have the children in it steal for them.  One small, but tough, girl named Miette runs away from the school, finds One, and aides him in his search.  When the two women find out about their little thief, they go to Marcello, a retired man who used to run a circus freakshow, to get what they need to catch and kill the little girl and her newfound friend.  Although this plot seems a bit hard to follow, it all fits together perfectly in the end with wondrous results.  To accompany this odd story,  there is a beautiful soundtrack composed by Angelo Badalmenti with one song ("Who Will Take Your Dreams Away") by Marianne Faithful.  This music fits the mood and plot of the story perfectly and stays with you(as does the movie itself) long after the credits have rolled.\n\nThe casting director of "The City Of Lost Children", Pierre-Jacques Benochou, sure knew what he was doing, because there is not one poor (or mediocre one, for that matter) performance in the whole film.  In fact, I might just say all the performances were virtually flawless.  Ron Perlman's performance as the slow and dimwitted circus strongman One is beautifully acted.  Mr. Perlman should especially be recognized because he is an American actor and this is a subtitled French film.  Daniel Emilfork as the depressed and dreamless mad scientist with a short temper is outstanding and most believable.  Dominique Pinon is wonderful (perhaps the best actor in the whole movie) as the seven rubberfaced identical brothers (yes, he does play all of them, and with fantastic results, too).  The two different actresses who portray the siamese twins, Odile Mallet and Genevieve Brunet, are perfectly wicked and their timing is impeccable.  Last, but not least, the children, with Judith Vittet as Miette in a stand-out performance, all carry out their roles with smashing results.\n\nAnother reason for me choosing "The City Of Lost Children" as the best movie of 1996 is its stunning direction.  This movie was directed by the famous French directing team of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro(a.k.a. "Jeunet and Caro").  The camera angles that are used during the course of this film are a totally different experience and they keep you mesmerized from start to finish.  The directors of this film are, in my opinion, masters of the camera.  The visuals in this movie also contributed to my conclusion that this is the best movie of 1996.  Whatever it might have been, whether the bleak and unique use of colors or the special effects, I was absolutely captivated by what I was seeing on the screen.  What I particularly liked about this film's special effects was that they were not the typical flashy and in-your-face computer special effects that some of today's blockbusters and other genre films seem to have.  I think such special effects distract you from the rest of the movie.  On the contrary, the special effects of "The City Of Lost Children," however, are very subtle.  A final thing I liked about this film were its sets.  From the waterlogged streets of the dank and moldy town to the spectacular gadgetry of Krank's laboratories everything was a magnificent panorama for the eye to behold.\n\nWas the plot great?  Yes.  How was the acting?  Outstanding.  Was the direction done well?  Definitely.  How did the visuals appear?  They were beautifully presented.  From what you have read, whether you have concluded to avoid this movie completely or go out and rent it right away (I do understand that this movie does have a select audience), I am hopeful that you understand the picture I am trying to paint.  Even if the story will not appeal to you, it is still splendidly done.  Overall, though, "The City Of Lost Children" is definitely the best movie of 1996 for me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66486,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1995-05-17","keywords":"psychotronic film,underwater scene,children,dream,aging","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The City of Lost Children","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4236902681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlkNTAzY2MtNmVjYS00Mzk5LWJlNGYtNzI1N2JhZDgwMmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlkNTAzY2MtNmVjYS00Mzk5LWJlNGYtNzI1N2JhZDgwMmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256399/","name":"Daniel Emilfork","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900136/","name":"Judith Vittet"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070568/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054943/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0545615/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012496/","name":"Gilles Adrien","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The dude (Mathieu) is doomed to be loved by girls, and it's true that he is nearly perfect.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":557,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-09-20","keywords":"french president,female rear nudity","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0243355/","name":"Albert Dupontel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753737/","name":"Jérémie Renier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0723623/","name":"Claude Rich"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0217803/","name":"Lionel Delplanque"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065548/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079800/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0146460/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0217803/","name":"Lionel Delplanque","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1217275/","name":"Raphaël Meltz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2409312/","name":"Agnès Caffin"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is another in that by now too long series, one that has nothing new to add. We see lots of ugly backstage scenes, and then, very rarely, a glimpse of the beauty of a Fuller performance.\n\nPart of that is because, if one were to judge from this movie, Fuller was very much a one-trick pony. She was not, in any significant sense, a dancer. Rather, she was a show woman who figured out how to use lighting and mirrors to create a beautiful, magical effect as she twirled around waving robes extended on bamboo batons.\n\nIn fact, however, the real Loie Fuller was a fascinating and very versatile woman involved in developing new lighting techniques and all sorts of other things to improve stage performance. This movie VERY much shortchanges her, and should not in any way be taken as a biopic. Why a woman director would reduce an evidently very intelligent and interesting woman to a pouting bundle of uncontrolled emotions I do not know.\n\nIf you were to believe this movie - and you shouldn't - there really wasn't much to Fuller's art. Nothing like ballet, or modern dance, or jazz dancing, or ... Just twirling around, waving her robes, while different colored lights and background mirrors enhanced the effect. \n\nSo we are left with her life. If it was at all as it is presented in the movie, and there is no reason to assume that that was the case, it was pretty miserable. We see that she spends lots of time building up her shoulder muscles so she can keep waving those robes, with the result that her arms often hurt. The light from the colored light hurts her eyes. She ends up in several confusing and bad relationships. A rough life, in other words. But the movie does nothing to make us care.\n\nThis movie needed a MUCH better script to make us understand and sympathize with Fuller. Otherwise, except for the few moments when she goes into her dance, it's just a lot of uncontrolled emotions that we have no reason to care about. It seems a real shame to have reduced what was evidently a very interesting and intelligent woman to a bundle of uninteresting emotions.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2455,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2016-09-28","keywords":"dancing,year 1892,love,paris opera,lesbian kiss","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1331316/","name":"Soko"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0880484/","name":"Gaspard Ulliel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0858048/","name":"Mélanie Thierry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7283069/","name":"Stéphanie Di Giusto"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044413/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024845/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0410559/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0081179/","name":"Thomas Bidegain"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7598710/","name":"Giovanni Lista"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7283069/","name":"Stéphanie Di Giusto"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As I had no history or prior knowledge to the events that transpired in Iran in the 1980s, the brief amount of a history lesson was just enough to maintain my interest. Throughout the film, there are times when I might have started to wander through long bouts of dialog, but witty comments by the characters kept me entertained. By the time the climax was about to hit, I was sitting on the edge of my seat, biting at my fingers, awaiting their next move.\n\nWell done Ben, well done.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":584611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But from the moment the movie began up until the end, I was gripping for the characters the whole way, the way movies should be.\n\nThe opening of the movie played a huge part in setting the tone of the rest of the film. As I had no history or prior knowledge to the events that transpired in Iran in the 1980s, the brief amount of a history lesson was just enough to maintain my interest. Throughout the film, there are times when I might have started to wander through long bouts of dialog, but witty comments by the characters kept me entertained. By the time the climax was about to hit, I was sitting on the edge of my seat, biting at my fingers, awaiting their next move.\n\nWell done Ben, well done.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":584611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="xx">Capote</title>
    <title lang="fr">Truman Capote</title>
    <desc lang="fr">Capote: Directed by Bennett Miller. With Allie Mickelson, Kelci Stephenson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Craig Archibald.

Once the viewer gets beyond this sticking point, however, all three works are outstanding, unforgettable experiences. Unlike the book and the original movie, "Capote" does explore the contradictory feelings that author Truman Capote wrestles with as he researches and writes "In Cold Blood." His feelings for Perry Smith, the more "sensitive" of the two killers, are particularly problematic as Capote becomes emotionally close to Smith and helps the men with legal aide that postpones the executions, while at the same time Capote cannot finish his book until Smith and Hickcock are hanged. Praise for Philip Seymour Hoffman's uncanny performance as Truman Capote cannot be overstated and, come awards time, if he does not collect enough accolades to fill his mantel, indictments for film critics and Academy voters would be in order. Hoffman not only captures the mannerisms and voice of Capote, he inhabits the man's soul and expresses his feelings and emotions without histrionics or the type of caricature that mimics often have made of the notoriously fey writer in the past.\n\nFortunately, Hoffman's performance is only the jewel in a gilded crown of fine writing, excellent direction, and solid supporting performances. "Capote" will send viewers back to their bookshelves to re-read the book and to their video libraries to re-view the 1967 film.

 --- Description: Capote: Directed by Bennett Miller. With Allie Mickelson, Kelci Stephenson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Craig Archibald. In 1959, Truman Capote learns of the murder of a Kansas family and decides to write a book about the case. While researching for his novel In Cold Blood, Capote forms a relationship with one of the killers, Perry Smith, who is on death row." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0379725/","name":"Capote","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMzU0MjM1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjczNzgyNA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In 1959, Truman Capote learns of the murder of a Kansas family and decides to write a book about the case.

Once the viewer gets beyond this sticking point, however, all three works are outstanding, unforgettable experiences. Unlike the book and the original movie, "Capote" does explore the contradictory feelings that author Truman Capote wrestles with as he researches and writes "In Cold Blood." His feelings for Perry Smith, the more "sensitive" of the two killers, are particularly problematic as Capote becomes emotionally close to Smith and helps the men with legal aide that postpones the executions, while at the same time Capote cannot finish his book until Smith and Hickcock are hanged. Praise for Philip Seymour Hoffman's uncanny performance as Truman Capote cannot be overstated and, come awards time, if he does not collect enough accolades to fill his mantel, indictments for film critics and Academy voters would be in order. Hoffman not only captures the mannerisms and voice of Capote, he inhabits the man's soul and expresses his feelings and emotions without histrionics or the type of caricature that mimics often have made of the notoriously fey writer in the past.\n\nFortunately, Hoffman's performance is only the jewel in a gilded crown of fine writing, excellent direction, and solid supporting performances. "Capote" will send viewers back to their bookshelves to re-read the book and to their video libraries to re-view the 1967 film. Considering the time that Capote spent with the two convicted murderers, questions arise as to why the Richard Brooks film did not have Truman Capote as a character, but rather presented a bland, nameless investigative writer, who wanders through the proceedings without much purpose. The film is so good and so intriguing that questions such as that, and what happened to the writer that Capote lived with? and did Harper Lee write anything beyond "To Kill a Mockingbird?" and did Capote's presence at the execution lead to his alcoholism, his lack of further writing, and eventually his death, and other questions will send viewers to Google as soon as they get home.

So the Spacey film would have depicted events near the end of this film. Both are superb movies.\n\nBack to the review. This film is very unusual in that the producers have shown fierce determination in taking a serious topic and making it as user friendly as one possibly can. Multiple techniques are used to this end and they all work well. In fact in places the film has a Monty Python quality. Why was this done? One can only assume that the producers understood the multiple studies showing that the modern city-dweller becomes uncomfortable when confronted with any facts which suggest that he or she was not paying attention when bad things were happening. After all we live in a democracy so the voters should have been more alert? Isn't that their job? The techniques mentioned attempt to appeal to our SESAME STREET side and make the whole thing as pleasant an educational experience as possible.

So the Spacey film would have depicted events near the end of this film. Both are superb movies.\n\nBack to the review. This film is very unusual in that the producers have shown fierce determination in taking a serious topic and making it as user friendly as one possibly can. Multiple techniques are used to this end and they all work well. In fact in places the film has a Monty Python quality. Why was this done? One can only assume that the producers understood the multiple studies showing that the modern city-dweller becomes uncomfortable when confronted with any facts which suggest that he or she was not paying attention when bad things were happening. After all we live in a democracy so the voters should have been more alert? Isn't that their job? The techniques mentioned attempt to appeal to our SESAME STREET side and make the whole thing as pleasant an educational experience as possible. But make no mistake, this is an educational movie.\n\nOne that should be mandatory for adults. Like getting a driving test before a license. How about learning about Wall Street and the banks before you invest with them...? Carell steals the film and may finally get the attention he deserves. Great actor.\n\nFinally the message.

A great movie after the first one. MI:II is must not be considered an MI movie, but this one here builds the foundation to take the series further. We get an insight of Hunt's life. The driving force of the MI series is Hunt's dilemmas. The movie begins to get into the MI universe with showing us what Hunt is made of and why he chooses what he chooses in the next films. The actions were a plus point, very few overuse of action is encountered. The action were basic nevertheless. But still the movie gives away many of Hunt's super spy skills like lip reading and webslinging across building. Got to say, Hunt is very lucky to survive so many life and death situation.\n\nThe acting was on point, the other characters other than Hunt hadn't have any significant challenges in acting considering the calibre of them. Tom Cruise grew as an actor and it showed if his performance from first two filmshas to be considered. I wish the movie was less predictable and avoided the cliches. It's a good movie to pass your time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":336114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H6M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

(a first for me, with fantasy adaptations) Plenty of money has been thrown at this series and it shows, in a good way. Yet there's nothing Hollywood about it, it's 100% British.\n\nWe're treated to a good bit of the background story during this episode, a thankless task, skilfully done and quite quickly. We're immediately thrown into the action and I am hooked, even though I know what's coming.\n\nThe sets are amazing, the music excellent, the cast is A1: this is the BBC so it is exceptionally diverse -which is already giving us a bunch of fine actors that might not be so famous and gives us a bit of modern colour. I'm not sure yet about Lyra, she's not what I expected but I've the feeling she'll turn out to be what was needed, if not what I wanted. Lord Asriel is just the right mixture of downright attractive and breezily self-centered as in the books. As to Mrs Coulter she's just fantastically and dangerously attractive. I finally understand what Lyra loved in her. The Gyptians are represented perfectly and individually and the whole thing has a tint of alternate medievality which mirrors the book exactly.\n\nAll in all, episode 1 is a success.\n\n I could go on and on but really, just watch it, you'll know after twenty minutes whether you'll like it or not.\n\n\n\nEpisode 2: some fair deviations from the book, all in aid of story comprehension, suspense and doling appetising spoilers from much later to the viewer so that they won't drop off - you can't blame them really, they need to keep the viewership interested, considering the price of production.

And really leaves you hating having to wait a year for the rest, excellent finish.\n\n UPDATE SERIES 2:\n\nWhile there were a few pacing/acting issues in series 1, the first 2 episodes of series 2 are nail-bitingly near perfect. Absolutely brilliant beginning and better visuals than ever. The plot and the world's are really well handled in every particulars.

It's rather on the dark side, and definitely not for children the way the books are.\n\n Episode 3: I had minor doubts with episode 2 and the "new" storylines but this episode was very exciting and has allayed them. The whole thing is now moving forward properly and the plot is very tight in an action TV series sort of a way, without losing the spirit of the books. Back to a 9.\n\nThe following episodes are a bit hit and miss, some pacing/acting /directing issues - Lee Scoresby the one unmitigated success - trying too hard to force suspense to fit the tv format rather than concentrate on telling the story as a one whole, but the last episode packs a punch and gets to you. And really leaves you hating having to wait a year for the rest, excellent finish.\n\n UPDATE SERIES 2:\n\nWhile there were a few pacing/acting issues in series 1, the first 2 episodes of series 2 are nail-bitingly near perfect. Absolutely brilliant beginning and better visuals than ever. The plot and the world's are really well handled in every particulars.

It looks like episode 3 will carry on with being rather different from the book storyline, while sticking to it at the same time, if that makes sense. It's rather on the dark side, and definitely not for children the way the books are.\n\n Episode 3: I had minor doubts with episode 2 and the "new" storylines but this episode was very exciting and has allayed them. The whole thing is now moving forward properly and the plot is very tight in an action TV series sort of a way, without losing the spirit of the books. Back to a 9.\n\nThe following episodes are a bit hit and miss, some pacing/acting /directing issues - Lee Scoresby the one unmitigated success - trying too hard to force suspense to fit the tv format rather than concentrate on telling the story as a one whole, but the last episode packs a punch and gets to you. And really leaves you hating having to wait a year for the rest, excellent finish.\n\n UPDATE SERIES 2:\n\nWhile there were a few pacing/acting issues in series 1, the first 2 episodes of series 2 are nail-bitingly near perfect. Absolutely brilliant beginning and better visuals than ever. The plot and the world's are really well handled in every particulars. Persevere if you were in two minds about series 1.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The Gyptians are represented perfectly and individually and the whole thing has a tint of alternate medievality which mirrors the book exactly.\n\nAll in all, episode 1 is a success.\n\n I could go on and on but really, just watch it, you'll know after twenty minutes whether you'll like it or not.\n\n\n\nEpisode 2: some fair deviations from the book, all in aid of story comprehension, suspense and doling appetising spoilers from much later to the viewer so that they won't drop off - you can't blame them really, they need to keep the viewership interested, considering the price of production. It's still very well done, and it's quite scary and tense, also the modern world (already shown) has been updated to current times. It looks like episode 3 will carry on with being rather different from the book storyline, while sticking to it at the same time, if that makes sense. It's rather on the dark side, and definitely not for children the way the books are.\n\n Episode 3: I had minor doubts with episode 2 and the "new" storylines but this episode was very exciting and has allayed them. The whole thing is now moving forward properly and the plot is very tight in an action TV series sort of a way, without losing the spirit of the books. Back to a 9.\n\nThe following episodes are a bit hit and miss, some pacing/acting /directing issues - Lee Scoresby the one unmitigated success - trying too hard to force suspense to fit the tv format rather than concentrate on telling the story as a one whole, but the last episode packs a punch and gets to you. And really leaves you hating having to wait a year for the rest, excellent finish.\n\n UPDATE SERIES 2:\n\nWhile there were a few pacing/acting issues in series 1, the first 2 episodes of series 2 are nail-bitingly near perfect. Absolutely brilliant beginning and better visuals than ever. The plot and the world's are really well handled in every particulars. Persevere if you were in two minds about series 1.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

(a first for me, with fantasy adaptations) Plenty of money has been thrown at this series and it shows, in a good way. Yet there's nothing Hollywood about it, it's 100% British.\n\nWe're treated to a good bit of the background story during this episode, a thankless task, skilfully done and quite quickly. We're immediately thrown into the action and I am hooked, even though I know what's coming.\n\nThe sets are amazing, the music excellent, the cast is A1: this is the BBC so it is exceptionally diverse -which is already giving us a bunch of fine actors that might not be so famous and gives us a bit of modern colour. I'm not sure yet about Lyra, she's not what I expected but I've the feeling she'll turn out to be what was needed, if not what I wanted. Lord Asriel is just the right mixture of downright attractive and breezily self-centered as in the books. As to Mrs Coulter she's just fantastically and dangerously attractive. I finally understand what Lyra loved in her. The Gyptians are represented perfectly and individually and the whole thing has a tint of alternate medievality which mirrors the book exactly.\n\nAll in all, episode 1 is a success.\n\n I could go on and on but really, just watch it, you'll know after twenty minutes whether you'll like it or not.\n\n\n\nEpisode 2: some fair deviations from the book, all in aid of story comprehension, suspense and doling appetising spoilers from much later to the viewer so that they won't drop off - you can't blame them really, they need to keep the viewership interested, considering the price of production. It's still very well done, and it's quite scary and tense, also the modern world (already shown) has been updated to current times. It looks like episode 3 will carry on with being rather different from the book storyline, while sticking to it at the same time, if that makes sense. It's rather on the dark side, and definitely not for children the way the books are.\n\n Episode 3: I had minor doubts with episode 2 and the "new" storylines but this episode was very exciting and has allayed them. The whole thing is now moving forward properly and the plot is very tight in an action TV series sort of a way, without losing the spirit of the books. Back to a 9.\n\nThe following episodes are a bit hit and miss, some pacing/acting /directing issues - Lee Scoresby the one unmitigated success - trying too hard to force suspense to fit the tv format rather than concentrate on telling the story as a one whole, but the last episode packs a punch and gets to you. And really leaves you hating having to wait a year for the rest, excellent finish.\n\n UPDATE SERIES 2:\n\nWhile there were a few pacing/acting issues in series 1, the first 2 episodes of series 2 are nail-bitingly near perfect. Absolutely brilliant beginning and better visuals than ever. The plot and the world's are really well handled in every particulars. Persevere if you were in two minds about series 1.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's still very well done, and it's quite scary and tense, also the modern world (already shown) has been updated to current times. It looks like episode 3 will carry on with being rather different from the book storyline, while sticking to it at the same time, if that makes sense. It's rather on the dark side, and definitely not for children the way the books are.\n\n Episode 3: I had minor doubts with episode 2 and the "new" storylines but this episode was very exciting and has allayed them. The whole thing is now moving forward properly and the plot is very tight in an action TV series sort of a way, without losing the spirit of the books. Back to a 9.\n\nThe following episodes are a bit hit and miss, some pacing/acting /directing issues - Lee Scoresby the one unmitigated success - trying too hard to force suspense to fit the tv format rather than concentrate on telling the story as a one whole, but the last episode packs a punch and gets to you. And really leaves you hating having to wait a year for the rest, excellent finish.\n\n UPDATE SERIES 2:\n\nWhile there were a few pacing/acting issues in series 1, the first 2 episodes of series 2 are nail-bitingly near perfect. Absolutely brilliant beginning and better visuals than ever. The plot and the world's are really well handled in every particulars. Persevere if you were in two minds about series 1.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There has never been a show or a film that came as close to showing what life must have been like in those lawless young towns that got built nearly over night wherever gold was found. A magnet for all kind of fortune seekers (gold diggers, whores, outlaws – but also settlers who were just hoping to build a better life), the town of Deadwood was notorious even by the standards of the time. In the show, this "cesspool of vice" is brought back to life with great attention to historical detail. You'll find no romanticised view of pioneers who lived and died by "the code of honour", but real people whose moral standards are – in most cases – murky at best. And the world they inhabit is a rough, dirty, violent place where only the fiercest – and the most cunning – survive. \n\nAs far as the historical characters depicted in the show are concerned, the writers naturally had to take some liberties (after all, nobody knows exactly who said or did what at the time), but the depiction of the era and the historical background are very accurate. Yet this is not a history lesson; it's an immensely entertaining western-show blessed with some of the best writers and actors working in television and film today – and especially the cast of 'Deadwood' really can't get enough praise: there is not a single performance here that isn't excellent. Of course, the one who steals the show is Ian McShane. His Al Swearengen is one of the most morally complex and fun-to-watch characters I've ever seen (and he misses absolutely no opportunity to show you just what the first five letters in "SWEAR-engen" stand for). The power-struggles in Deadwood he is involved in – and since he wants to maintain his position at the top of the food-chain he's involved in all of them – are equalled in complexity and entertainment value only by those in top-notch shows like 'Game of Thrones', 'House of Cards' or 'Breaking Bad'. And the lengths Al is willing to go to achieve his goals secure him a place in the top ten of "all-time great bad-asses".\n\nSo my verdict: While certainly not for the easily offended or those who prefer a "sanitized version" of the old west, 'Deadwood' offers a fascinating look at a time we mostly know from myths and legends and gives us a chance to revisit those and see them from a different angle.

There has never been a show or a film that came as close to showing what life must have been like in those lawless young towns that got built nearly over night wherever gold was found. A magnet for all kind of fortune seekers (gold diggers, whores, outlaws – but also settlers who were just hoping to build a better life), the town of Deadwood was notorious even by the standards of the time. In the show, this "cesspool of vice" is brought back to life with great attention to historical detail. You'll find no romanticised view of pioneers who lived and died by "the code of honour", but real people whose moral standards are – in most cases – murky at best. And the world they inhabit is a rough, dirty, violent place where only the fiercest – and the most cunning – survive. \n\nAs far as the historical characters depicted in the show are concerned, the writers naturally had to take some liberties (after all, nobody knows exactly who said or did what at the time), but the depiction of the era and the historical background are very accurate. Yet this is not a history lesson; it's an immensely entertaining western-show blessed with some of the best writers and actors working in television and film today – and especially the cast of 'Deadwood' really can't get enough praise: there is not a single performance here that isn't excellent. Of course, the one who steals the show is Ian McShane. His Al Swearengen is one of the most morally complex and fun-to-watch characters I've ever seen (and he misses absolutely no opportunity to show you just what the first five letters in "SWEAR-engen" stand for). The power-struggles in Deadwood he is involved in – and since he wants to maintain his position at the top of the food-chain he's involved in all of them – are equalled in complexity and entertainment value only by those in top-notch shows like 'Game of Thrones', 'House of Cards' or 'Breaking Bad'. And the lengths Al is willing to go to achieve his goals secure him a place in the top ten of "all-time great bad-asses".\n\nSo my verdict: While certainly not for the easily offended or those who prefer a "sanitized version" of the old west, 'Deadwood' offers a fascinating look at a time we mostly know from myths and legends and gives us a chance to revisit those and see them from a different angle.

Spain had become an empire by 1500's under Catholic Kings : Isabel and Fernando , Charles I and after Felipe II , the most poweful country in Europe and all over the world at the time . It is set in Sevilla, 16th century, one of the most marvellous and smelliest cities in the world , it is a time of plague , pursuit , superstition, as well as hyper-religiosity and during a terrible plague epidemic . There appears Mateo Nuñez : Pablo Molinero , he is a condemned by Inquisition, as a high-authority priest named Celso de Guevara : Manolo Solo assigns him to investigate a series of murders happened in the noisy city of Seville where more than forty different languages were spoken and all the gold from America arrived on its por t. In the midst of a dirty atmosphere suffocated by mistrust and betrayals on the order of the day , he will have to discover the author of such astonishing and grisly killings . The second season deals with Mateo Nuñez and Teresa Pinelo : Patricia López Arnaiz , who face off Maria de la O : Stefania de los Santos , and a dangerous and bloody criminal organization, Mafia-alike, called La Garduña operating in Sevilla by human trafficking , prostitution and labouring exploitation.\n\nNice costumer, dense and painfully realistic mystery thriller with solid performance , enjoyable locations , impeccable scenarios and lavishly filmed. Set in the post-Medieval Seville with its social constitution struck by the plague , it was one of the main cities of the Western world , known as the Great Babylon, it was home to people of all races and people of all kinds and strangest conditions . Do not expect luxurious palaces , sweet Renaissance settings and gorgeous decoration seen in other foreign series such Versalles, The Borgia , Michael Hirst's Tudor or Richard Madden's The Medici. On the contrary, you can appreciate sinister environments , brothels , dirtiness, bowery, city slums and the deepest poverty. As far as I'm concerned the especial writing is pretty well , being its authentic creators Rafael Cobos and Alberto Rodriguez. Convincingly performed by Pablo Molinero as Matthew who investigates the found corpses of several murdered people as an omen of the end of the world . Matthew will have to find out who is the author of a series of diabolical crimes committed against the high places of Sevillian society . Otherwise , he will not find the forgiveness of the Holy Office and the Inquisition as he will decide to investigate it at whatever means. Being finely accompanied by Patricia López Arnaiz as a mysterious factory owner , Paco Tous as her administrator assistant , Paco León, Manolo Solo, Cecilia Gómez, Sergio Castellanos, Manuel Morón , Melina Matthews, Estefania de Santos, Jesús Carroza, Julián Villagrán, Antonio Dechent, Luis Callejo , among others.\n\nIt displays an evocative and atmospheric musical score by Julio de la Rosa. It contains picturesque cinematography by cameramen Rau Steve and Andreu Adamo Rubiralta. Shot on several locations as Utrera, Coria del Rio, Dos Hermanas Carmona, Santiponce, Alcala de Guadaira, Gelves, Mairena, Puebla de Rio, Sevilla, Trujillo, Caceres, Palos de la Frontera, Huelva, Cuevas de Almanzora, Almeria, and Toledo. And we can find the real interiors of the Sevillian Palaces, Casa Contratation of Sevilla and sightseeing as the riverside, Giralda, Torre del Oro, Cathedral and other buildings, monuments by means of CGI. This surprising crime drama was well directed by Alberto Rodriguez. He is considered to be one of the best Spanish filmmakers, including notorious films as Grupo 7, Factor Pilgrim, 7 Virgins, The suit , El hombre de las 1000 caras, being his biggest hit : Marshland . Rating : above average, 7/10 for the accuracy in depicting the XVI century city , as the money are not waste, though not for too squeamish watchers due to its sour seeing of poorness, sleazy events, nudism , heinous killings and extreme realism .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1857,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-12","keywords":"plague,murder investigation,death,violence,blood","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1944825/","name":"Pablo Molinero","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3802082/","name":"Patricia López Arnaiz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1525783/","name":"Sergio Castellanos"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0296182/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0544623/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1943791/","name":"Rafael Cobos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735705/","name":"Alberto Rodríguez"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you like gangster/mobster/mafia movies, I can strongly recommend "The Sopranos". The show is mainly about Anthony "Tony" Soprano and his life as a father, husband and leader of a mob in the 21st century. The show is (as far as I know) realistic, compared to many other mafia shows and movies I have seen. The actors fit like a glove to their parts. This show made me realize how good many of these actors are in other shows and movies. This show has it all; humor, action, drama, good music, good actors, good "behind the camera" people and a good plot. The show displays all sides of the mob business; "buisness", private life, the cops/FBI point of view, the victims side of the story and much more.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":330401,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":9.2,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1999-01-10","keywords":"violence,mafia,psychiatrist,cheating husband,cult tv","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001254/","name":"James Gandolfini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000966/","name":"Lorraine Bracco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004908/","name":"Edie Falco"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0214340/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176278/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0153740/","name":"David Chase"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Sopranos:Season 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2751070489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBlNDAzZTUtM2ZmOS00OTg4LWJkNWEtNDU2NzU2NDNmZTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBlNDAzZTUtM2ZmOS00OTg4LWJkNWEtNDU2NzU2NDNmZTg5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I love the grittiness, the laughs, the emotional value and the edge of your seat action that I get from this show. I read alot of the reviews on here and kept hearing about how season 5 was a disappointment. Well I couldn't agree less. Every season has been amazing. I'm actually dreading that I'm coming up to the end. Happy to read that they have already started production of season 7. This show is a win in my book. Highly recommend. And it doesn't hurt that I am a Boston girl, born and raised.

It's not meant to be. It's meant to be entertaining and that's exactly what it is.","reviewBody":"When the credits started, I had a big smile on my face.\n\nWhat is your perception of 2 Guns? Whether you've seen the trailer or read the comic, you might have an idea what sort of movie this is. If so, you will be correct and happy you decided to watch it.\n\nThe big surprise many seem to have is the fact that this movie is based on the 2 GUNS comic Boom! Studios put out in 2007. I'll admit, despite the fact that I've always read a lot of Boom's comics, this series somehow completely snuck by. I did read the series before watching the movie. Whether or not you should do that, we'll get to that in minute.\n\nThe movie stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. That in itself is pretty impressive. These two actors crank up the charisma during the movie. You can't help but enjoy their presence on screen.\n\nThese two guys are planning on robbing a bank. It turns out it wasn't a simple bank and they ended up with way more than they thought. The twists and turns avalanche upon them as they discover others that are interested in the money plus the fact that they don't know each other as well as they thought. If you've watched the trailer, you probably know more about the movie than you should.\n\nWashington and Wahlberg are great together. For a movie with a lot of shooting and one- liners, it's the kind you can just become immersed in. This is pure entertainment. Parts may get a little outrageous and a tad predictable. But there are still plenty of twists to catch you off guard. You'll laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat and you'll even find yourself flinching or cringing a little at times.\n\nShould you or should you not read the comic first?\n\nThat really depends on how much you want to know ahead of time. Some of the twists weren't revealed in the trailers. The movie is pretty faithful to the comic, something pretty rare for a "comic book movie." There are obviously some minor differences but if you have read it before, you'll smile hearing some lines taken directly from the comic. Washington's casting is a bit of a departure. I felt as if his character and Wahlberg's were closer in age in the comic. But seeing the two together, it absolutely does not matter. These two made the movie fun.\n\nYou're probably aware this isn't a piece of fine art. It's not meant to be. Usually at this point in the summer, all the "big" Hollywood movies have been released. This is a movie that gives you a reason to go back to the theaters one more time.\n\nIt's more than just about Washington and Wahlberg. Those two could have easily carried the burden of being the box office draw. We are also treated to great performances by Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos, James Marsden and Paula Patton. That's what makes the movie even more of a pleasant surprise. You get a sense that some thought and care was put into the making of this movie.

It's not meant to be. It's meant to be entertaining and that's exactly what it is.","reviewBody":"When the credits started, I had a big smile on my face.\n\nWhat is your perception of 2 Guns? Whether you've seen the trailer or read the comic, you might have an idea what sort of movie this is. If so, you will be correct and happy you decided to watch it.\n\nThe big surprise many seem to have is the fact that this movie is based on the 2 GUNS comic Boom! Studios put out in 2007. I'll admit, despite the fact that I've always read a lot of Boom's comics, this series somehow completely snuck by. I did read the series before watching the movie. Whether or not you should do that, we'll get to that in minute.\n\nThe movie stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. That in itself is pretty impressive. These two actors crank up the charisma during the movie. You can't help but enjoy their presence on screen.\n\nThese two guys are planning on robbing a bank. It turns out it wasn't a simple bank and they ended up with way more than they thought. The twists and turns avalanche upon them as they discover others that are interested in the money plus the fact that they don't know each other as well as they thought. If you've watched the trailer, you probably know more about the movie than you should.\n\nWashington and Wahlberg are great together. For a movie with a lot of shooting and one- liners, it's the kind you can just become immersed in. This is pure entertainment. Parts may get a little outrageous and a tad predictable. But there are still plenty of twists to catch you off guard. You'll laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat and you'll even find yourself flinching or cringing a little at times.\n\nShould you or should you not read the comic first?\n\nThat really depends on how much you want to know ahead of time. Some of the twists weren't revealed in the trailers. The movie is pretty faithful to the comic, something pretty rare for a "comic book movie." There are obviously some minor differences but if you have read it before, you'll smile hearing some lines taken directly from the comic. Washington's casting is a bit of a departure. I felt as if his character and Wahlberg's were closer in age in the comic. But seeing the two together, it absolutely does not matter. These two made the movie fun.\n\nYou're probably aware this isn't a piece of fine art. It's not meant to be. Usually at this point in the summer, all the "big" Hollywood movies have been released. This is a movie that gives you a reason to go back to the theaters one more time.\n\nIt's more than just about Washington and Wahlberg. Those two could have easily carried the burden of being the box office draw. We are also treated to great performances by Bill Paxton, Edward James Olmos, James Marsden and Paula Patton. That's what makes the movie even more of a pleasant surprise. You get a sense that some thought and care was put into the making of this movie. Not only is it faithful to the comic, the filmmakers also made sure it had a great cast and delivered a really good quality production.\n\nThe movie is rated R. Clearly there is quite a bit of violence. There's plenty of shooting, killing and explosions. It gets a little over the top but that's what you should expect from this kind of movie. There is also some brief nudity and plenty of profanity. In other words, this isn't a family film. What it is is a movie you go see with your friends. Buy some popcorn, lean back in your seat and just enjoy the movie and have a great time.\n\nI mentioned leaving the theater with a smile. It's not a "feel good" movie. But it will make you laugh and give you a good time. That's exactly what I want for my money. It's fun and absurd with over the top action. Do I want a sequel? Boom!

Outstanding action movie plenty of thrills , suspense , intrigue , twists and turns . An excellent whodunit deals with an air marshal (Liam Neeson) springs into action during a transatlantic flight (the airplane used in the film is a Boeing 767-300) after receiving a series of text messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfers $150 million into an off-shore account . After several e-mails , only to discover that someone has taken on his account and that no one , not even the crew , believes him . With the help of a young flight attendant (Michelle Dockery) and a likable passenger (Julianne Moore) he sets out to prove who he is . He confronts enemies in order to find out the true killer , but someone is still after him and is forced to take up violent means to discover them . He takes the law on his own hands and acting as a desperate person . The hijacking was just the beginning .\n\nThis exciting film contains suspense , thrills , noisy action, shootouts , violent fights and plot twits . From start to final the frantic action and fast movement is unstopped . The motion picture is only set on two scenarios : the airport and mostly plane . However this doesn't make boring it , as the movie will appeal to suspense enthusiasts and thriller lovers . The aircraft is clearly fictional, a type is never referred to during the course of the film , whilst it appears to be the size of a Boeing 767-400, the cabin interior, door operation &amp; arrangement and flight deck layout do not match this type of aircraft. The set for the plane was built very slightly larger than a standard commercial airliner to accommodate Neeson's 6'4" height for filming and roughly 200 extras were cast , all of them stayed throughout filming . The runtime movie is overlong : two hours and some but isn't slow-moving and is amount amusing for suspense and intrigue . Liam Neeson is top-notch as a drunken and discredited air marshal ; Liam Neeson has propelled many an action thriller to big box office numbers, as Unknown , Taken 2 and this Non-stop . Accompany efficiently to starring two nice actresses as Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery . There are many suspects , all support cast formed by good secondaries such as Scoot McNairy , Corey Stoll , Jon Abrahams , Nate Parker , Jason Butler , Linus Roache , Shea Whigham , Anson Mount and Lupita Nyong'o who in her next film would win an Academy Award .\n\nColorful cinematography by cameraman Flavio Martinez Labiano using Steadicam and with majority locations from plane interior . The musician John Ottman creates a stirring , rousing soundtrack fitting to frenetic action . Lavishly produced including spectacular scenes by the successful American producer Joel Silver . The flick was compellingly directed by Jaume Collet-Serra . Collet is an expert director of terror movies as ¨Orphan¨, ¨House of wax¨ and for TV , ¨The river¨ , and of course his greatest hit was ¨Unknown¨ also with Liam Neeson and similar artistic team as cameraman Flavio Laviano , musician John Ottman and producer Joel Silver . Rating : Better than average, well worth seeing . The picture will appeal to explosive action fans .","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253579,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Outstanding action movie plenty of thrills , suspense , intrigue , twists and turns . An excellent whodunit deals with an air marshal (Liam Neeson) springs into action during a transatlantic flight (the airplane used in the film is a Boeing 767-300) after receiving a series of text messages that put his fellow passengers at risk unless the airline transfers $150 million into an off-shore account . After several e-mails , only to discover that someone has taken on his account and that no one , not even the crew , believes him . With the help of a young flight attendant (Michelle Dockery) and a likable passenger (Julianne Moore) he sets out to prove who he is . He confronts enemies in order to find out the true killer , but someone is still after him and is forced to take up violent means to discover them . He takes the law on his own hands and acting as a desperate person . The hijacking was just the beginning .\n\nThis exciting film contains suspense , thrills , noisy action, shootouts , violent fights and plot twits . From start to final the frantic action and fast movement is unstopped . The motion picture is only set on two scenarios : the airport and mostly plane . However this doesn't make boring it , as the movie will appeal to suspense enthusiasts and thriller lovers . The aircraft is clearly fictional, a type is never referred to during the course of the film , whilst it appears to be the size of a Boeing 767-400, the cabin interior, door operation &amp; arrangement and flight deck layout do not match this type of aircraft. The set for the plane was built very slightly larger than a standard commercial airliner to accommodate Neeson's 6'4" height for filming and roughly 200 extras were cast , all of them stayed throughout filming . The runtime movie is overlong : two hours and some but isn't slow-moving and is amount amusing for suspense and intrigue . Liam Neeson is top-notch as a drunken and discredited air marshal ; Liam Neeson has propelled many an action thriller to big box office numbers, as Unknown , Taken 2 and this Non-stop . Accompany efficiently to starring two nice actresses as Julianne Moore and Michelle Dockery . There are many suspects , all support cast formed by good secondaries such as Scoot McNairy , Corey Stoll , Jon Abrahams , Nate Parker , Jason Butler , Linus Roache , Shea Whigham , Anson Mount and Lupita Nyong'o who in her next film would win an Academy Award .\n\nColorful cinematography by cameraman Flavio Martinez Labiano using Steadicam and with majority locations from plane interior . The musician John Ottman creates a stirring , rousing soundtrack fitting to frenetic action . Lavishly produced including spectacular scenes by the successful American producer Joel Silver . The flick was compellingly directed by Jaume Collet-Serra . Collet is an expert director of terror movies as ¨Orphan¨, ¨House of wax¨ and for TV , ¨The river¨ , and of course his greatest hit was ¨Unknown¨ also with Liam Neeson and similar artistic team as cameraman Flavio Laviano , musician John Ottman and producer Joel Silver . Rating : Better than average, well worth seeing . The picture will appeal to explosive action fans .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253579,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That Neville is a former scientist who is immune to the deadly strain is a bonus as it means he can work on a potential cure.\n\nYes it's daft, and yes it's contrived, but there sure is a lot of good stuff to enjoy before the films major failing surfaces. Firstly is Will Smith's performance, there is no doubting he is a major star these days, but here he also cements his standing as a bona fide A lister of note. He layers the performance so well, his character not only has to deal with the heavy threat of being killed by the mutants at night, he also has to fight his own isolation, mans inherent need for companionship is a tortured thing when you appear to be the sole beneficiary of gods green earth.\n\nSecondly the setting of a barren desolate New York is eerily staggering, overgrown with foliage and stalked by lions searching for food, it really is a big screen must to embrace the scope of it. Thirdly the mutants themselves are scary enough, but they honestly would have been better served being played by human actors rather than the CGI used that brings very mixed results, and fourthly the tension building is pitch perfect, the makers manage to have you on the edge of your seat gasping for a solution to this cracking story unfolding, but then...\n\nThey throw it all away by a rushed ending that had me positively seething, a quick turn of events should be a prelude to a fully fleshed out finale but instead we get a quick wham bam, oh The End. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth on leaving the cinema and frankly the audience deserves better, and in fact so does Will Smith, did they run out of money? Well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame that. 6.5/10\n\nFootnote: Having just watched the alternate version that is readily available on disc formats, I have to say that as weak and as frustrating as the theatrical ending is, the alternate ending is far worse, trite and totally misplaced, they chose the better ending of the two for sure.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":701719,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame that. 6.5/10\n\nFootnote: Having just watched the alternate version that is readily available on disc formats, I have to say that as weak and as frustrating as the theatrical ending is, the alternate ending is far worse, trite and totally misplaced, they chose the better ending of the two for sure.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":701719,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I admit that I have done so in a few cases myself (Thin Red Line).  However, in this case, I feel I must point out a few things.\n\nAll such films come with a disclaimer saying something to the effect that the characters portrayed aren't real and the story is just that, a story. For entertainment.  Martin and Tavington did not actually exist, they are merely characters, possibly based (as has been suggested) on actual historical figures.  I often wonder if such films as Treasure of the Sierra Madre, or Rio Grande, or just about any western flick was judged so harshly when it came out as we judge 'historical' pictures today?  Or any pirate film?  Zorro?  Any film with knights in it?  It seems to me that unless you are making a documentary, the historical accuracy doesn't truly matter in detail.  Certainly, I enjoy films better when they seem to be a reasonably accurate portrayal of a time (costumes, technologies), but I don't carp about whether some person existed.  Even if they did, I expect the film to be untrue so I can be entertained. For example, most wars are not constant fighting.  Certainly some battles went on for days at a time, but there is a lot of waiting and a lot of marching.  Yet most war films seem to be battle after battle after battle, with no real respite except for the wounded.  Not so. How about some facts?    Fact:  Americans fought against themselves during the war.  Many Americans served with the British forces.    Fact:  There were in fact many atrocities committed by the British forces, rapes, property burning, etc.  Don't believe me?  Check out the history of what happened to the original signers of the Declaration of Independence, their families and their properties.  That's actual history, not just entertainment history.  Of course, this wasn't only limited to the British forces.  According to Massachusetts history, the Revolutionary forces (not necessarily the armed forces even) were, um, not kind to people who sympathized with the British.  The tavern recruitment scene suggests this quite well.  Were churches actually burned with a town's population inside.  Maybe, maybe not, but it certainly was dramatic, wasn't it? Fact:  Literacy was not as common at that time as it is today.  Many people, especially the lower classes, and slaves could not read.    \n\n Did Cornwallis have a pair of great danes that were 'captured' by the enemy? I doubt it, but possibly. Were slaves that served in either army freed after a certain term of service?  Again, I don't know.  (I am not even certain that slavery was allowed in Britain at the time.  Indentured servants, I think yes (though the difference is slight, I grant you), but actual slavery, hmm.  I'll have to check on that.)  The colonies typically did form their own militias for local use.  The americans did, as a general rule, fight using more guerilla tactics  (especially early on, the american forces were composed largely of more militia than regulars, see below for comments on militia), check the accounts of the battle of Concord, and what happened to the British forces as they withdrew.\n\nWar is brutal and ugly.  People die.  Many of the soldiers don't want to be there.  Militia, being less well trained and thus disciplined, does have a tendency to fight very poorly in set piece battles (check current and past arguments for keeping a 'standing' 'professional' army).\n\nIgnoring the historical accuracies or lack thereof (and btw, Braveheart was not 100% accurate either, though the main characters , Wallace, Robert the Bruce, King Edward, did all exist, but again, I don't seem to recall people complaining so loudly about that)  I found Mel's character to be believable and well portrayed.  Yes, there were elements of Hollywood happiness in the film (the beach town, he workers attitudes, the romances) and Hollywood sadness' in the film (the massacre, the child's death), but it was very entertaining.  I found many of the battles to be very realistic (okay, pistols WERE NOT that accurate and never have been) and sufficiently entertaining for my needs.\n\nOverall, a very good film.  Hollywood, certainly, but entertaining.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258975,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That Neville is a former scientist who is immune to the deadly strain is a bonus as it means he can work on a potential cure.\n\nYes it's daft, and yes it's contrived, but there sure is a lot of good stuff to enjoy before the films major failing surfaces. Firstly is Will Smith's performance, there is no doubting he is a major star these days, but here he also cements his standing as a bona fide A lister of note. He layers the performance so well, his character not only has to deal with the heavy threat of being killed by the mutants at night, he also has to fight his own isolation, mans inherent need for companionship is a tortured thing when you appear to be the sole beneficiary of gods green earth.\n\nSecondly the setting of a barren desolate New York is eerily staggering, overgrown with foliage and stalked by lions searching for food, it really is a big screen must to embrace the scope of it. Thirdly the mutants themselves are scary enough, but they honestly would have been better served being played by human actors rather than the CGI used that brings very mixed results, and fourthly the tension building is pitch perfect, the makers manage to have you on the edge of your seat gasping for a solution to this cracking story unfolding, but then...\n\nThey throw it all away by a rushed ending that had me positively seething, a quick turn of events should be a prelude to a fully fleshed out finale but instead we get a quick wham bam, oh The End. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth on leaving the cinema and frankly the audience deserves better, and in fact so does Will Smith, did they run out of money? Well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame that. 6.5/10\n\nFootnote: Having just watched the alternate version that is readily available on disc formats, I have to say that as weak and as frustrating as the theatrical ending is, the alternate ending is far worse, trite and totally misplaced, they chose the better ending of the two for sure.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":701719,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That Neville is a former scientist who is immune to the deadly strain is a bonus as it means he can work on a potential cure.\n\nYes it's daft, and yes it's contrived, but there sure is a lot of good stuff to enjoy before the films major failing surfaces. Firstly is Will Smith's performance, there is no doubting he is a major star these days, but here he also cements his standing as a bona fide A lister of note. He layers the performance so well, his character not only has to deal with the heavy threat of being killed by the mutants at night, he also has to fight his own isolation, mans inherent need for companionship is a tortured thing when you appear to be the sole beneficiary of gods green earth.\n\nSecondly the setting of a barren desolate New York is eerily staggering, overgrown with foliage and stalked by lions searching for food, it really is a big screen must to embrace the scope of it. Thirdly the mutants themselves are scary enough, but they honestly would have been better served being played by human actors rather than the CGI used that brings very mixed results, and fourthly the tension building is pitch perfect, the makers manage to have you on the edge of your seat gasping for a solution to this cracking story unfolding, but then...\n\nThey throw it all away by a rushed ending that had me positively seething, a quick turn of events should be a prelude to a fully fleshed out finale but instead we get a quick wham bam, oh The End. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth on leaving the cinema and frankly the audience deserves better, and in fact so does Will Smith, did they run out of money? Well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame that. 6.5/10\n\nFootnote: Having just watched the alternate version that is readily available on disc formats, I have to say that as weak and as frustrating as the theatrical ending is, the alternate ending is far worse, trite and totally misplaced, they chose the better ending of the two for sure.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":701719,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I admit that I have done so in a few cases myself (Thin Red Line).  However, in this case, I feel I must point out a few things.\n\nAll such films come with a disclaimer saying something to the effect that the characters portrayed aren't real and the story is just that, a story. For entertainment.  Martin and Tavington did not actually exist, they are merely characters, possibly based (as has been suggested) on actual historical figures.  I often wonder if such films as Treasure of the Sierra Madre, or Rio Grande, or just about any western flick was judged so harshly when it came out as we judge 'historical' pictures today?  Or any pirate film?  Zorro?  Any film with knights in it?  It seems to me that unless you are making a documentary, the historical accuracy doesn't truly matter in detail.  Certainly, I enjoy films better when they seem to be a reasonably accurate portrayal of a time (costumes, technologies), but I don't carp about whether some person existed.  Even if they did, I expect the film to be untrue so I can be entertained. For example, most wars are not constant fighting.  Certainly some battles went on for days at a time, but there is a lot of waiting and a lot of marching.  Yet most war films seem to be battle after battle after battle, with no real respite except for the wounded.  Not so. How about some facts?    Fact:  Americans fought against themselves during the war.  Many Americans served with the British forces.    Fact:  There were in fact many atrocities committed by the British forces, rapes, property burning, etc.  Don't believe me?  Check out the history of what happened to the original signers of the Declaration of Independence, their families and their properties.  That's actual history, not just entertainment history.  Of course, this wasn't only limited to the British forces.  According to Massachusetts history, the Revolutionary forces (not necessarily the armed forces even) were, um, not kind to people who sympathized with the British.  The tavern recruitment scene suggests this quite well.  Were churches actually burned with a town's population inside.  Maybe, maybe not, but it certainly was dramatic, wasn't it? Fact:  Literacy was not as common at that time as it is today.  Many people, especially the lower classes, and slaves could not read.    \n\n Did Cornwallis have a pair of great danes that were 'captured' by the enemy? I doubt it, but possibly. Were slaves that served in either army freed after a certain term of service?  Again, I don't know.  (I am not even certain that slavery was allowed in Britain at the time.  Indentured servants, I think yes (though the difference is slight, I grant you), but actual slavery, hmm.  I'll have to check on that.)  The colonies typically did form their own militias for local use.  The americans did, as a general rule, fight using more guerilla tactics  (especially early on, the american forces were composed largely of more militia than regulars, see below for comments on militia), check the accounts of the battle of Concord, and what happened to the British forces as they withdrew.\n\nWar is brutal and ugly.  People die.  Many of the soldiers don't want to be there.  Militia, being less well trained and thus disciplined, does have a tendency to fight very poorly in set piece battles (check current and past arguments for keeping a 'standing' 'professional' army).\n\nIgnoring the historical accuracies or lack thereof (and btw, Braveheart was not 100% accurate either, though the main characters , Wallace, Robert the Bruce, King Edward, did all exist, but again, I don't seem to recall people complaining so loudly about that)  I found Mel's character to be believable and well portrayed.  Yes, there were elements of Hollywood happiness in the film (the beach town, he workers attitudes, the romances) and Hollywood sadness' in the film (the massacre, the child's death), but it was very entertaining.  I found many of the battles to be very realistic (okay, pistols WERE NOT that accurate and never have been) and sufficiently entertaining for my needs.\n\nOverall, a very good film.  Hollywood, certainly, but entertaining.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258975,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.\n\nAnd one final note.

It even has one of the most brutal fight scenes in any Superman movie which could be a bit hard to watch.

Brandon Routh's portrayal of Clark Kent/Superman, I feel, is second only to Christopher Reeves, whom he does a great job of capturing. \n\nThe action scenes are top-notch and fun to watch. It even has one of the most brutal fight scenes in any Superman movie which could be a bit hard to watch. Yes, even more than the Zack Snyder movies.\n\nThis movie is far from perfect, but it is a lot better than what it's given credit for. I do recommend checking it out.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":273850,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT2H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Maybe they better could have shown him recording his 1st hit album - but thats the way biopics go, you have to add some drama.... in the end this film will be very successfull in Germany, and even for foreign film lovers there is a lot to see and hear - and don't miss supporting role Detlev Buck as Mattheisen, the greasy slick Teldec A&amp;R manager :-)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":570,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Biography","Music"],"datePublished":"2020-01-16","keywords":"f rated,biopic,male frontal nudity,male nudity,male rear nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2635317017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4MGE3YjQtOTYxOC00M2FjLThlNjUtNGY1N2ViYzM0YWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4MGE3YjQtOTYxOC00M2FjLThlNjUtNGY1N2ViYzM0YWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6060272/","name":"Jan Bülow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11175621/","name":"Jesse Hansen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0421799/","name":"Julia Jentsch"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0403101/","name":"Hermine Huntgeburth"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073926/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027692/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0279815/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749191/","name":"Alexander M.

Australia has all of this, but also a little bit of corn, a thin plot, weak characters and flaws that are even more noticeable in a super-production like this.\n\nThe script is uneven and Manichean (with angels and demons) and mixes several movie genres (romantic comedy, romantic drama, war movie, western movie, and Aboriginal movie) with different degrees of success. The characters are descriptive and without emotional depth, and that affects the acting. However, I loved the depiction of the magic and wisdom of Aboriginal Australians, which is really well presented, with its magic beliefs and philosophical and environmental approach to the world. I think that part is truly genuine and real and reaches the viewer. I also loved that Lady Ashley's character is the one of a true modern woman, as she is a strong-willed free woman, a boss, the boss of her man, a woman who always leads, never submissive or afraid of being alone if she doesn't get what she wants. That's a post-modern woman, so rare to see in cinema nowadays.\n\nThe acting is unconvincing on the part of the leading actors. Hugh Jackman's performance is just OK in his role, while Nicole Kidman disappoints in the comic part of the movie, as she seems not to relax when she does so, but she warms up to her usual self when the story becomes more dramatic; she looks beautiful in this movie, like a 50s movie star, although those inflated siliconed lips were a distraction... Jackman and Kidman make a great couple, but their chemistry on camera was nothing memorable and you see yourself seeing two actors playing a couple, not a real couple on screen.\n\nMost supporting actors are good in their roles, especially the Aboriginal ones, who really shine in this film. David Gulpilil is simply terrific, completely believable and inspired in his role of the Aboriginal Elder King George. Brandon Walters, despite his youth, offers a memorable performance, and his face really lights up the screen. Also great is the actor who plays Drove's Aboriginal pal, who also offers a solid performance. They are the ones who really give soul to the movie.\n\nDespite what you might expect, the cinematography is poor. I was expecting the rare beauty of the Northern Territory to be captured by the always stylish and colorful Luhrmann. However, the part of the movie that happens during the dry season is completely opaque and colorless, ugly to watch, while the scenes happening during the rainy season are again limited in colors.To my disenchantment, many of the most colorful and beautiful scenes are digitally created or enhanced, while others seem to have been shot in big studios. Just the Mission island seems to convey that luxurious real feeling of the NT vegetation. Some of the most beautiful bits of the real land, the aerial vistas, look like if they had been taken for a documentary for National Geographic. Where is the emotional connection of the story with the land? In other words, the viewer doesn't go beyond what the eyes see. So, one wonders, why the movie was called Australia and why it was sold as a movie that captured the spirit of this country. To be honest, I thought that most scenes in the movie could have been shot anywhere in the world not in Australia.\n\nThe movie is a little too long. Most of the first half an hour could have been removed , condensed or presented in another way to give the non-Aboriginal characters more emotional background and depth. For example, we barely know why Neil Fletcher wants so badly Sarah's farm, and why he's so wicked in general but he loves a lovable sweet good- hearted woman. He is just an archetypal bad-guy, period.\n\nDespite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie, especially the second hour and a half, and that heaven of a man that is Hugh Jackman. God Bless him and his holy body.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. \n\nTaking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.\n\nA film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.   \n\nUnlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, `Ocean's Eleven' is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.  It's cinematic junk food of the highest order, but, then, since when has junk food not been satisfying?"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":528712,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. \n\nTaking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.\n\nA film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.   \n\nUnlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, `Ocean's Eleven' is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.  It's cinematic junk food of the highest order, but, then, since when has junk food not been satisfying?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":528712,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Also shout out to Ben Mendelssohn as the villain robot hand. Perfect for a 007 inspired feature. Also, very cool hearing DJ Khalid's voice coming out of a character called sound. Then the most important part, the animation itself which was quite amazing. They did some thangs that really captured my eye and fully helped pushed a great story.

Will is the man as a man turned into a bird. Tom Holland was pretty amazing too. For those of you who love his run as Spider-Man, there is enough of that inside this character to have you loving it. Also shout out to Ben Mendelssohn as the villain robot hand. Perfect for a 007 inspired feature. Also, very cool hearing DJ Khalid's voice coming out of a character called sound. Then the most important part, the animation itself which was quite amazing. They did some thangs that really captured my eye and fully helped pushed a great story. Overall, It's fantastic.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39821,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The acting is well done, both from the kids and adults. The cast ensemble is made up of some fairly prominent names. I quite enjoyed watching, though I'm still not sure I get what dust is, or why the college let Nicole Kidman take the girl "as an assistant". It was all fairly good, watching ioryek slap the jaw off a polar bear was a highlight. But my main grievance is that they set up for a sequel that never happened, leaving the ending lacking.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181512,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For the most part it's a miss, we RARELY have a funny or original romantic comedy. It's been over a year since we've had a good romantic comedy and this year seems to be pushing the horrible movies of this genre. For example, we had The Proposal that was released this year and it was just awful and so simple. The Ugly Truth seemed to be heading the same way when I first saw the trailer, but when I learned that it was Rated R, I decided to try to give it a chance. Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I had expected, it actually had some really great laughs and is a heck a lot better than The Proposal. But once again The Ugly Truth fell back into the ugly formula of clichés that are just annoying and there were quite a few things that I would have done differently with the story, I'll first explain the plot.\n\nAbby, a TV producer, is coming home from another disastrous date one night, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, "The Ugly Truth," run by Mike Chadway, whose cynicism of relationships prompts Abby to call into the show to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers that the station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings, and the station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show to bring them back up. At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds Abby to be a control freak. However she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin living next to her, and Mike persuades her to follow his lead. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to quit; he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. But being a romantic comedy, Abby and Mike instead fall for each other as usual, you know how the story goes.\n\nNow things I would've done different, if you don't want spoilers then don't read on: there is a child that comes into Mike's apartment, he and Mike get along great, I'm thinking that's his son; instead it's his nephew. I think this would have added substance to his character and made him more likable and would have had a better story on why he was so bitter on women, maybe like the mother left him or something. Second: I honestly would have had Abby chosen the doctor over Mike. Katherine and Gerad are great on screen together, but their chemistry for this film I felt was more of a great friendship than falling in love with each other. Her choosing Mike over the doctor was so typical, I would have had the doctor find out about what was going on and then take her back realizing that he still liked her very much and then Mike ends up with some slutty girl as usual happy with his shallow life, but still enjoying it. Third: no tired formulas, no girl best friend supporting everything the lead female does, no big kiss in front of an audience, no dramatic of finding out what a kiss meant. Fourth: why do we have gorgeous people claiming they have a hard time finding love or supposedly not having sex for a year? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm finding it hard to believe that girls who look like Katherine Heigl are having the hardest time finding love.\n\nBut there are some positives in the film, honestly I did have a good time watching this film over all, it was just the ending that killed the movie. But even the little rip off of When Harry Met Sally where Abby is wearing vibrating panties at a company dinner and someone saying what was in her food to have the same effect, it's an old joke but it never gets old. I loved that this was a Rated R rom-com because the reason MOST of these movies don't work are due to the fact that they're too family friendly and very much unrealistic. Not to say that The Ugly Truth is completely realistic, but more so than most films. We have some sick jokes but get a great laugh, Abby is going to a baseball game with Colin, her crush, and she accidentally spills her drink on his lap and starts rubbing his pants to clean them and the kiss cam lowers in on them with a bad angle looking like she's just having fun with his hot dog. Honestly I think most of the theater had a hard time catching their breath on that joke, no one could stop laughing. Katherine and Gerad do have great chemistry on screen, I just think it would have worked better as a friendship. So I would say this is better suited as a rental vs. a theater view. It's a lot better than I expected but had more potential as it falls back into the same old tired formula.\n\n6/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":207931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There are just too many relationships going on with too much confusion in the tales and, above all, a really weak and saccharine script from Katherine Fugate.\n\nThe best performance comes from Anne Hathaway but, if you just want to spot the stars, there's plenty on show including Ashton Kutcher and Jamie Foxx, Julia Roberts and Jennifer Gardner, Hector Elizondo and Shirley MacLaine.

It must have looked such a great idea when pitched to the studio: a huge cast of stars, multiple story lines with cross connections, different takes on romance, lots of songs about love, and - even better than the Anglo film they would claim - Los Angeles (instead of London) and Valentine's Day (instead of Christmas).\n\nBut it just doesn't work and only underlines how subtle and clever was the original version. There are just too many relationships going on with too much confusion in the tales and, above all, a really weak and saccharine script from Katherine Fugate.\n\nThe best performance comes from Anne Hathaway but, if you just want to spot the stars, there's plenty on show including Ashton Kutcher and Jamie Foxx, Julia Roberts and Jennifer Gardner, Hector Elizondo and Shirley MacLaine. That's right, someone for guys and gals, young and old, white and ethnic, straight and gay. Except for a couple of nice little twists at the end, it is all so formulaic and predictable - and a little moralistic.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":115462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For the most part it's a miss, we RARELY have a funny or original romantic comedy. It's been over a year since we've had a good romantic comedy and this year seems to be pushing the horrible movies of this genre. For example, we had The Proposal that was released this year and it was just awful and so simple. The Ugly Truth seemed to be heading the same way when I first saw the trailer, but when I learned that it was Rated R, I decided to try to give it a chance. Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I had expected, it actually had some really great laughs and is a heck a lot better than The Proposal. But once again The Ugly Truth fell back into the ugly formula of clichés that are just annoying and there were quite a few things that I would have done differently with the story, I'll first explain the plot.\n\nAbby, a TV producer, is coming home from another disastrous date one night, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, "The Ugly Truth," run by Mike Chadway, whose cynicism of relationships prompts Abby to call into the show to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers that the station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings, and the station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show to bring them back up. At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds Abby to be a control freak. However she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin living next to her, and Mike persuades her to follow his lead. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to quit; he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. But being a romantic comedy, Abby and Mike instead fall for each other as usual, you know how the story goes.\n\nNow things I would've done different, if you don't want spoilers then don't read on: there is a child that comes into Mike's apartment, he and Mike get along great, I'm thinking that's his son; instead it's his nephew. I think this would have added substance to his character and made him more likable and would have had a better story on why he was so bitter on women, maybe like the mother left him or something. Second: I honestly would have had Abby chosen the doctor over Mike. Katherine and Gerad are great on screen together, but their chemistry for this film I felt was more of a great friendship than falling in love with each other. Her choosing Mike over the doctor was so typical, I would have had the doctor find out about what was going on and then take her back realizing that he still liked her very much and then Mike ends up with some slutty girl as usual happy with his shallow life, but still enjoying it. Third: no tired formulas, no girl best friend supporting everything the lead female does, no big kiss in front of an audience, no dramatic of finding out what a kiss meant. Fourth: why do we have gorgeous people claiming they have a hard time finding love or supposedly not having sex for a year? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm finding it hard to believe that girls who look like Katherine Heigl are having the hardest time finding love.\n\nBut there are some positives in the film, honestly I did have a good time watching this film over all, it was just the ending that killed the movie. But even the little rip off of When Harry Met Sally where Abby is wearing vibrating panties at a company dinner and someone saying what was in her food to have the same effect, it's an old joke but it never gets old. I loved that this was a Rated R rom-com because the reason MOST of these movies don't work are due to the fact that they're too family friendly and very much unrealistic. Not to say that The Ugly Truth is completely realistic, but more so than most films. We have some sick jokes but get a great laugh, Abby is going to a baseball game with Colin, her crush, and she accidentally spills her drink on his lap and starts rubbing his pants to clean them and the kiss cam lowers in on them with a bad angle looking like she's just having fun with his hot dog. Honestly I think most of the theater had a hard time catching their breath on that joke, no one could stop laughing. Katherine and Gerad do have great chemistry on screen, I just think it would have worked better as a friendship. So I would say this is better suited as a rental vs. a theater view. It's a lot better than I expected but had more potential as it falls back into the same old tired formula.\n\n6/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":207931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Take the Road Trip with Chef and enjoy a film that lets you leave the theater feeling full of love, life and in pursuit of the nearest Franklin's BBQ.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201407,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Despite being warned very strongly against going to see this film and despite the trailer looking unappetising, I still saw it anyway. It was always going to be a film that would go either way, the amount of talent on board, my general love for family films and for Postman Pat could have suggested that the film would be fun and charming, but there was the worry also that it would look as muddled, target-audience-confused and hasty-looking as the trailer suggested. The film has its moments and it is not from personal opinion quite as bad as heard, but it was a big disappointment. The film begins very promisingly with a very idyllic opening that was the closest the film ever got in resembling the show, the Big Time song is a great upbeat song that has some very funny visual gags, the montage where Pat meets his wife for the first time was very touching and the "Faster Pussy-Bot, Kill Kill!" seemed like a Daleks reference and it was if the case a clever one at that. The soundtrack is catchy and bring energy to the film and the voice cast are good and very enthusiastic, David Tennant sounds like he's having a whale of a time but Steven Mangan, who's very sympathetic and dead-on as Pat, and Jim Broadbent acquit themselves very well too.\n\nSadly, Postman Pat: The Movie is let down by that it didn't seem to know what to do with itself or know who to aim the film at. The story is rather over-complicated and confused focusing mainly on the talent show subplot and also including a Dr Who-like robot invasion/world domination one, neither of which show any originality, cleverness or charm. The satire for the former is nowhere near sharp enough, the humour actually felt to me rather forced mostly throughout the film and borders on vulgar while the latter felt thrown in and like it belonged in another film altogether, is not all that cleverly or thrillingly done and may contain bits that the younger audience may find scary or upsetting. The script would have benefited from a far more simpler approach and less going on and while it is admirable that the film did clearly think of the adult audience I think it could have done a better job at having more for the youngsters. Some of the jokes will go over their heads, unless they were introduced to Dr Who at a very young age, and if they are familiar with the whimsy and warmth that the show had the film sadly is a far cry from that. The characters are bland, the exceptions being Pat who is very likable and possibly Jess as well but the others lacked personality. The film was unevenly paced with some of the earlier parts in need of more zip and some of the later parts in need of a slow-down, most apparent in a climax that was action-packed but too busy and dark compared to the rest of the film. The soundtrack is one of the best things about Postman Pat: The Movie and Ronan Keating does a great job as Pat's singing voice but it is a case of the singing voice not matching the speaking voice especially in the tone. Just as disappointing as the writing was the animation, the opening was really promising but the rest looked like it was made in a lot of haste and had some very over-saturated and too bright colours, the characters also lack expression and on occasions look creepy, Pat is the one exception. Overall, a disappointing feature film debut of a much cherished classic character, not an awful film and has some good assets but it felt over-stuffed, muddled and bland with some cheap direct-to-video-like visuals with the opening being the only time where it bared any resemblance to the show. 4/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1629,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Here is a movie that wants to have fun, the cast wants to have fun. The audience ends up having fun. Steve Zahn is hilarious. Matthew McConaughey handles the limited demands of his role quite well. Penelope Cruz brings her ever-present charm and beauty to a role which is notable for being one of the few action-adventure roles written for a female that is not obnoxious in recent memory. You can't take your eyes off William H. Macy whenever he is on screen in ANY movie. He's that good.\n\nIt's kind of a Bond meets Indiana Jones film (I swear they used the same canyon from "Raiders of the Lost Ark") The villains are one dimensional, but who cares? We are here to follow the exploits of our heroes. If we have to suspend our disbelief, we do it willingly because we are grinning ear to ear.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":93976,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Here is a movie that wants to have fun, the cast wants to have fun. The audience ends up having fun. Steve Zahn is hilarious. Matthew McConaughey handles the limited demands of his role quite well. Penelope Cruz brings her ever-present charm and beauty to a role which is notable for being one of the few action-adventure roles written for a female that is not obnoxious in recent memory. You can't take your eyes off William H. Macy whenever he is on screen in ANY movie. He's that good.\n\nIt's kind of a Bond meets Indiana Jones film (I swear they used the same canyon from "Raiders of the Lost Ark") The villains are one dimensional, but who cares? We are here to follow the exploits of our heroes. If we have to suspend our disbelief, we do it willingly because we are grinning ear to ear.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":93976,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Star Wars Episode II. These are what are typically named as the worst direct sequels ever.\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be worse than a quadruple feature of all of those. I mean it when I say Paul Blart 2 is one of the most unfunny, moronic, brain cell killing experiences I've had in a cinema. There's an extended sequence where an old man eats a rotten banana that goes on for around 15 seconds. The film begins with Blart's elderly mom getting killed by a milk truck. There's a part where Blart interrupts a stage show and knocks out all the dancers by spinning around on a rope while squealing. There's a part where Blart is attacked by and beats an exotic bird while a piano player nods and smiles (DUDE JUXTAPOSITION LMAO). There's a entire segment dedicated to showcasing multiple Checkov's Guns in the form of a mall cop convention (As if those even existed). I dunno   I didn't enjoy it.\n\nBlart is somehow more unlikable this time around. Rather than a smug dumbass, he's now a smug asshole. The "film" is 50% him making fun of people, 30% Blart falling down, 20% plot holes, and 0% funny. I maybe chucked at some points, but truth is I don't even remember the movie or what it was I chucked at. I can say for sure there are more helicopter shots reminding the target audience (Who to be fair also probably need to be reminded to breathe and blink) that the movie is set in Vegas than there were chuckles.\n\nYou know that rotten banana I mentioned? Paul Blart 2 is that banana, and the man eating is is the decrepit and moronic public eating up the film's schlock yet again, probably paving the way for another opportunity for Adam Sandler and co. to shill even more money out of Hollywood for his posse. Like my painful experience with Transformers 4, people once again applauded upon conclusion, one elderly couple saying "That was too funny!"\n\nThere's tastes in humor and then there's standards in humor. Paul Blart 2 wasn't unfunny to me because it did not pander to my sense of humor. If anything it should have; with all the misogyny and ridiculing of fat people it should have struck my dark humor funny bone. However, there's no gags, there's no punchlines, there's no jokes. There's also no emotional backbone, chemistry, or even real characters to back it up. Characters literally appear and disappear throughout the narrative. I don't even think the villain had a name. I don't think anyone not buds with Blart had one.\n\nThis time around, not only is Paul Blart a bland copy of Die Hard, but Taken and Ocean's 11. The plot is a cluster-f of nothing. The first 45 minutes are, like I mentioned, just Blart riding around and getting up in everyone's faces for "comedic" purposes, with plenty of empty time given for the target audience to laugh hysterically at like a bad sitcom. The actual "Paul Blart beating baddies" isn't until the film's finale, and even then he doesn't actually beat anyone, because all of his "weapons" are stupidly non-lethal, including a stun gun that only stuns people for 5 seconds, a gun that shoots gum, a gun that spills marbles vertically, and a bean bag cannon. Two characters actually fall asleep in the movie, one of them twice. I felt a kinship to them for that reason.\n\nThere's a romantic subplot with Blart's daughter and a bellhop that goes literally nowhere and an even more forced "romantic subplot" between a hotel manager and Blart. She gets progressively wetter and wetter for him throughout the film, which to me is too far of a stretch of imagination to comprehend and accept. This also leads to nowhere. The female cop on the horse in he trailer? That is literally the ending. Blart himself is beyond unlikable and revolting. He is not reluctant like John McClain from Die Hard, he craves to be the center of attention since his saving on the mall 6 years ago became utterly irrelevant the day after (I wish I could say the same for the movie itself). He's incompetent, rude, crude, and physically unable to actually do anything heroic. He'd make a good anti-hero if he wasn't presented as this humble all American goody two shoes as the movie does.\n\nThe movie doesn't even take place in a mall. What's up with that? With truly atrocious jokeless dialogue ("I will bring a folk guitar to a pumpkin fight, because that's how crazy I am!"), beyond unlikable characters, an incompetent lead, a transparent and personality-less villain, disappearing subplots, stretched imagination, cliché and trope filled writing I can say Baul Plart: pop Tart Too is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Offensively stupid and brash, this blatant cashgrab managed one seemingly impossible feat, sink even lower than the previous film. Utterly baffling, this 1.5 hour Wynn commercial (Not a single scene takes place outside of it once they arrive) is to me the Transformers 2 of comedy, a wretched anorexic piece with no soul, craft, or effort put into it at all. The fraction of points I award it are for the laughs my friends and I had at making fun of it and a single shot that lasted a third of a second that looked pretty cool.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35805,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2015-04-16","keywords":"2010s,security,guard,security guard,black","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4079988249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzk0NTE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwMTUzNDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzk0NTE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwMTUzNDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After six years of keeping our malls safe, Paul Blart has earned a well-deserved vacation.

I felt a kinship to them for that reason.\n\nThere's a romantic subplot with Blart's daughter and a bellhop that goes literally nowhere and an even more forced "romantic subplot" between a hotel manager and Blart. She gets progressively wetter and wetter for him throughout the film, which to me is too far of a stretch of imagination to comprehend and accept. This also leads to nowhere. The female cop on the horse in he trailer? That is literally the ending. Blart himself is beyond unlikable and revolting. He is not reluctant like John McClain from Die Hard, he craves to be the center of attention since his saving on the mall 6 years ago became utterly irrelevant the day after (I wish I could say the same for the movie itself). He's incompetent, rude, crude, and physically unable to actually do anything heroic. He'd make a good anti-hero if he wasn't presented as this humble all American goody two shoes as the movie does.\n\nThe movie doesn't even take place in a mall. What's up with that? With truly atrocious jokeless dialogue ("I will bring a folk guitar to a pumpkin fight, because that's how crazy I am!"), beyond unlikable characters, an incompetent lead, a transparent and personality-less villain, disappearing subplots, stretched imagination, cliché and trope filled writing I can say Baul Plart: pop Tart Too is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Offensively stupid and brash, this blatant cashgrab managed one seemingly impossible feat, sink even lower than the previous film. Utterly baffling, this 1.5 hour Wynn commercial (Not a single scene takes place outside of it once they arrive) is to me the Transformers 2 of comedy, a wretched anorexic piece with no soul, craft, or effort put into it at all. The fraction of points I award it are for the laughs my friends and I had at making fun of it and a single shot that lasted a third of a second that looked pretty cool.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35805,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2015-04-16","keywords":"2010s,security,guard,security guard,black","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4079988249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzk0NTE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwMTUzNDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzk0NTE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwMTUzNDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After six years of keeping our malls safe, Paul Blart has earned a well-deserved vacation.

Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Star Wars Episode II. These are what are typically named as the worst direct sequels ever.\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be worse than a quadruple feature of all of those. I mean it when I say Paul Blart 2 is one of the most unfunny, moronic, brain cell killing experiences I've had in a cinema. There's an extended sequence where an old man eats a rotten banana that goes on for around 15 seconds. The film begins with Blart's elderly mom getting killed by a milk truck. There's a part where Blart interrupts a stage show and knocks out all the dancers by spinning around on a rope while squealing. There's a part where Blart is attacked by and beats an exotic bird while a piano player nods and smiles (DUDE JUXTAPOSITION LMAO). There's a entire segment dedicated to showcasing multiple Checkov's Guns in the form of a mall cop convention (As if those even existed). I dunno   I didn't enjoy it.\n\nBlart is somehow more unlikable this time around. Rather than a smug dumbass, he's now a smug asshole. The "film" is 50% him making fun of people, 30% Blart falling down, 20% plot holes, and 0% funny. I maybe chucked at some points, but truth is I don't even remember the movie or what it was I chucked at. I can say for sure there are more helicopter shots reminding the target audience (Who to be fair also probably need to be reminded to breathe and blink) that the movie is set in Vegas than there were chuckles.\n\nYou know that rotten banana I mentioned? Paul Blart 2 is that banana, and the man eating is is the decrepit and moronic public eating up the film's schlock yet again, probably paving the way for another opportunity for Adam Sandler and co. to shill even more money out of Hollywood for his posse. Like my painful experience with Transformers 4, people once again applauded upon conclusion, one elderly couple saying "That was too funny!"\n\nThere's tastes in humor and then there's standards in humor. Paul Blart 2 wasn't unfunny to me because it did not pander to my sense of humor. If anything it should have; with all the misogyny and ridiculing of fat people it should have struck my dark humor funny bone. However, there's no gags, there's no punchlines, there's no jokes. There's also no emotional backbone, chemistry, or even real characters to back it up. Characters literally appear and disappear throughout the narrative. I don't even think the villain had a name. I don't think anyone not buds with Blart had one.\n\nThis time around, not only is Paul Blart a bland copy of Die Hard, but Taken and Ocean's 11. The plot is a cluster-f of nothing. The first 45 minutes are, like I mentioned, just Blart riding around and getting up in everyone's faces for "comedic" purposes, with plenty of empty time given for the target audience to laugh hysterically at like a bad sitcom. The actual "Paul Blart beating baddies" isn't until the film's finale, and even then he doesn't actually beat anyone, because all of his "weapons" are stupidly non-lethal, including a stun gun that only stuns people for 5 seconds, a gun that shoots gum, a gun that spills marbles vertically, and a bean bag cannon. Two characters actually fall asleep in the movie, one of them twice. I felt a kinship to them for that reason.\n\nThere's a romantic subplot with Blart's daughter and a bellhop that goes literally nowhere and an even more forced "romantic subplot" between a hotel manager and Blart. She gets progressively wetter and wetter for him throughout the film, which to me is too far of a stretch of imagination to comprehend and accept. This also leads to nowhere. The female cop on the horse in he trailer? That is literally the ending. Blart himself is beyond unlikable and revolting. He is not reluctant like John McClain from Die Hard, he craves to be the center of attention since his saving on the mall 6 years ago became utterly irrelevant the day after (I wish I could say the same for the movie itself). He's incompetent, rude, crude, and physically unable to actually do anything heroic. He'd make a good anti-hero if he wasn't presented as this humble all American goody two shoes as the movie does.\n\nThe movie doesn't even take place in a mall. What's up with that? With truly atrocious jokeless dialogue ("I will bring a folk guitar to a pumpkin fight, because that's how crazy I am!"), beyond unlikable characters, an incompetent lead, a transparent and personality-less villain, disappearing subplots, stretched imagination, cliché and trope filled writing I can say Baul Plart: pop Tart Too is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Offensively stupid and brash, this blatant cashgrab managed one seemingly impossible feat, sink even lower than the previous film. Utterly baffling, this 1.5 hour Wynn commercial (Not a single scene takes place outside of it once they arrive) is to me the Transformers 2 of comedy, a wretched anorexic piece with no soul, craft, or effort put into it at all. The fraction of points I award it are for the laughs my friends and I had at making fun of it and a single shot that lasted a third of a second that looked pretty cool.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35805,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2015-04-16","keywords":"2010s,security,guard,security guard,black","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4079988249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzk0NTE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwMTUzNDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzk0NTE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwMTUzNDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After six years of keeping our malls safe, Paul Blart has earned a well-deserved vacation.

Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Star Wars Episode II. These are what are typically named as the worst direct sequels ever.\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be worse than a quadruple feature of all of those. I mean it when I say Paul Blart 2 is one of the most unfunny, moronic, brain cell killing experiences I've had in a cinema. There's an extended sequence where an old man eats a rotten banana that goes on for around 15 seconds. The film begins with Blart's elderly mom getting killed by a milk truck. There's a part where Blart interrupts a stage show and knocks out all the dancers by spinning around on a rope while squealing. There's a part where Blart is attacked by and beats an exotic bird while a piano player nods and smiles (DUDE JUXTAPOSITION LMAO). There's a entire segment dedicated to showcasing multiple Checkov's Guns in the form of a mall cop convention (As if those even existed). I dunno   I didn't enjoy it.\n\nBlart is somehow more unlikable this time around. Rather than a smug dumbass, he's now a smug asshole. The "film" is 50% him making fun of people, 30% Blart falling down, 20% plot holes, and 0% funny. I maybe chucked at some points, but truth is I don't even remember the movie or what it was I chucked at.

It is nice to have a different view on things and be able to enjoy this European production ... just be open minded about it.\n\nReally good actors and an emotional conclusion of things ... one of the best movie trilogies ever made for sure gets its crowning finish ... no pun intended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2458,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Action","Adventure","Western"],"datePublished":"1966-08-17","keywords":"italo western,spaghetti western,land grab,friend,indian tribe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000851/","name":"Lex Barker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0108523/","name":"Pierre Brice","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0061309/","name":"Rik Battaglia"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718243/","name":"Harald Reinl"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102259/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023529/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043072/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562015/","name":"Karl May","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059342/","name":"J.

It deals with a nasty businessman nicknamed The Oilprince (Harald Leipnitz) . He looks forward to a lucrative covenant with the "Western Arizona Bank¨ represented by an ambitious banker . He sells the bank some oil wells at Shelly Lake that do actually not exist . Meanwhile , a group of colonists run by Bill Campbell (Walter Barnes) head to settle there . They are joined by Old Surehand (Stewart Granger) who agrees to escort them in a search for the precious lands . There is also a card player (Terence Hill or Mario Girotti) helping the group , but he has dark intentions , he is really a traitor ; later on , he falls in love with the girl (Macha Meril) in an enjoyable love story . Then , there takes place an emotive meeting between and Winnetou (recently deceased -2015- Pierre Brice) and Old Surehand to carry out their good purports and save them .

But soon the Oilprince has to recognize that he has not counted on Winnetou and his faithful half-brother Old Surehand , both of whom are on the trail to discover the truth . In spite of troubles caused by bandits led by unscrupulous Oilprince and some rebel Indians who seek revenge , they get escape . Old Surehand set out on pursuit of Oilprince and his minions bandits and prepares them a trap . After that , the train wagon reaches ¨Shelly Lake¨ , a location full of swift streams , risked falls and a dangerous river to cross in some spectacular scenes (most of them made by means of transparency) that are the highlights of the movie .

This is a so-so episode about one of the series of popular German made Western , featuring the duo who agree to guide the motley group trough Indian territory , both of them repeat their same notorious roles as dignified as always . This enjoyable saga benefits from sensational adventures , shoot'em up , betrayals , larger-than-life characters and overwhelming scenarios shot in Spandau, Berlin, Cetina river, Krka Falls, Krka National Park, Croatia and Perucko reservoir, Yugoslavia . \n\nWinnetou-Pierre Brice repeats , as usual, his excellent role to be continued in a TV series . Brice was descendant of old French nobility and considered to be one of the most famous and most loved actors in Germany and in the other countries in Eastern Europe , thanks to this role and starred several pictures as charming Indian Winnetou . He even received First Class Medal as one the most popular Frenchmen in Germany . In 1962, the German producer Horst Wendlandt searched for an actor who should play the Native American chief and got to know Brice at the Berlin Film Festival . He got the role and portrayed "Winnetou" in ten more movies . Barker scored especially high marks , though he played as a serious and intelligent man who joins forces with Winnetou , while Stewart Granger as Old Surehand performs with humor and joy , he's the perfect counterpoint to Winnetou . Enjoyable relationship between Old Surehand and Winnetou is quite match . The highbrow Lex Barker played the most part of series : ¨Apache gold (1963)¨ by Harald Reinl, ¨Apaches last Battle (1964)¨ by Hugo Fregonese, ¨Last of renegades(1964)¨, ¨The desperate trail¨, ¨Old Surehand¨ (1965) directed by Alfred Vohrer, ¨Old Shatterland(1966)¨ by Harald Philipp, ¨In the valley of death(1968)¨ by Harald Reinl . Stewart Granger took the role in two occasions , he starred a diverse character but the role is pretty similar to Old Shatterland , he plays with mirth and sympathetic manner as ¨Among vultures¨ and ¨Winnetou and Surehand¨ . Besides , Rod Cameron starred only one : ¨Old Firehand¨ in which chemistry between stuffy Cameron and Brice is inexistent . Nice support cast such as the customary nasty Harald Leipnitz along with the Morocco woman : Macha Méril , Walter Barnes and ¡ Terence Hill ! prior his amusing films with Bud Spencer playing as Trinidad and Bambino . In fact , Terence married an American girl of Bavarian descent , and learning German language , he starred several Germanic films , before his successful Italian ones . \n\nThe film displays a colorful cinematography and a catching , sensitive musical score ,though with excessive use of synthesizer by Martin Bottcher , series's ordinary , being eventually replaced in some episode by Peter Thomas . The motion picture ¨Rampage at Apache Wells¨ or ¨Der Olprinz¨ by Harald Philipp was well produced by Rialto Film Preben-Philipse/Horst Wendlandt /Constantin . The flick was professionally directed by Harald Philipp who made all kind of genres : action , Western , Wartime , besides he was a German thriller expert called Krimi -Edward Wallace adaptation- and realized another Western titled : ¨"Winnetou and the Crossbreed" . Rating : 5.5/10 , acceptable and passable . Worthwhile seeing for marvelous landscapes and breathtaking outdoors from Yugoslavia , including rousing falls , canyon, rivers and mountains ; all of them as spectacular as Almeria -Spain- outdoors where at the same time were shot numerous European Western .

It deals with Forester (the British Anthony Steel), a ruthless oil baron, who spreads a reign of terror from the badlands of Oklahoma to the hell-hills of the Dakotas and attempts to take Indian lands where there's petroleum . He wants to create a war between the native American tribes and the white men . Then there takes place an emotive meeting between and Winnetou (Pierre Brice) and Old Shatterhand (Lex Barker who married Spanish Carmen Cervera who subsequently wedded Braon Thyssen) .Old Shatterhand, Winnetou and their sidekick Castlepool (Arent) try to prevent this . Meanwhile Apache chief Winnetou saves a girl from a bear attack and then he falls in love for the gorgeous Indian (Karin Dor who married to director Harald Reinl) . They free three US soldiers taken prisoners by the Ponka tribe . They are joined by an army party and an amateur botanist to track down the outlaws .There is also a Lt. named Robert (Terence Hill or Mario Girotti previously his successful ¨Trinity¨) from the Army helping the group and he also falls in love with the Indian girl ,and takes place a particular loving triangle between Pierre Brice , Terence Hill and Karin Dor (of ¨Topaz¨ and appeared in other Karl May films as white woman) . Old Shatterland and his faithful half-brother are on the trail to chase the nasty Forester . In spite of troubles caused by bandits led by Luke (Klaus Kinski) who attack and massacre an Indian village , they get escape . Old Shatterhand set out on pursuit of the bandits and prepares them a trap . But when Shatterhand rides for military help against Forester's gang who captured their companions, he finds the tribe's friendly chief succeeded by his hostile Indians who prove to be a dangerous enemy . Later on , Winnetou attempts a treaty of peace and prepares a summit between the Indian tribes and the Northern Colonel (Renato Baldini). At the end , into a cave occurs a breathtaking epilogue by means of shootouts , explosions and fire .\n\nThis Western!?!?!Adventure results to be an acceptable episode about one of the series of popular German made Western , featuring the duo formed by valiant ¨Old Shatterhand¨ who agrees to guide the motley group trough Indian territory and immortal ¨Winnetou¨ , both of them repeat their same notorious roles as dignified as always . This enjoyable saga benefits from sensational adventures , shootouts , explosions , exciting combats, larger-than-life characters and spectacular scenarios shot in Atelier, Spandau, Berlin, Germany (studio),Grobnicko Polje, Croatia ,Kredarica, Lukovo, Plitvice, Yugoslavia ,Postojna cave, Radmanove Linice valley,Stobrec quarry, Yugoslavia,cement factory, Solin, Split, Croatia\n\nWinnetou-Pierre Brice repeats , as usual, his excellent and immortal role to be continued in a TV series. Lex Barker scores especially high marks , though he plays as a serious and intelligent frontiersman . Enjoyable relationship between Old Shatterhand and Winnetou is quite match . Pierre Brice is sensational as Winnetou , he is descendant of old French nobility , after enlisting as volunteer to the French Army and fighting in Indochina, he attended acting lessons and got a first small role in some film . In 1962, a German producer searched for an actor who should play the Native American chief Winnetou on a Western movie adapted from novels by Karl May and got to know Brice at the Berlin Film Festival. He got the role and portrayed "Winnetou" in ten more movies with his co-star Lex Barker as "Old Shatterhand". These very successful productions made him a superstar in Germany, winning several awards such as Bambi or the Golden Otto of teenager magazine "Bravo". Furthermore , received Germany's Cross of Merit, First Class as one the most popular Frenchmen in Germany . Although appearing on countless other movies and TV shows, he will always be best remembered as "Winnetou", whom he also played at the Bad Segeberg open air theater.\n\nThe highbrow Lex Barker who like his co-star and good friend Pierre Brice started a singing career and released several records and played the most part of series : ¨Apache gold(1963)¨ by Harald Reinl, ¨Apaches last Battle(1964)¨ by Hugo Fregonese, ¨Last of renegades(1964)¨, ¨The desperate trail¨, ¨Old Surehand¨ (1965) directed by Alfred Vohrer, ¨Old Shatterland(1966)¨ by Harald Philipp, ¨In the valley of death(1968)¨ by Harald Reinl . Stewart Granger took the role in two occasions ,he starred a diverse character but the role is pretty similar to Old Shatterland , he plays with mirth and liking manner as ¨Among vultures¨ and ¨Winnetou and Surehand¨ .Besides Rod Cameron starred only one : ¨Old Firehand¨ in which chemistry between stuffy Cameron and Brice is inexistent . The film displays a colorful cinematography and a catching , sensible musical score ,though with excessive use of synthesizer by Martin Bottcher , series' ordinary , being eventually replaced in some episode by Peter Thomas . The motion picture produced by Rialto Productions is professionally directed by Harald Reinl who realized various Karl May titles , besides he was a German thriller expert called Krimi - Edward Wallace adaptation- and filmed other Western as ¨The last Mohican¨ and a epic rendition , ¨Nibelungen ¨ also with Terence Hill and his wife Karin Dor ; unfortunately Harald Reinl died a few years ago , he committed suicide in Santa Cruz De Tenerife , Islas Canarias . Rating : 6 , acceptable and passable . Worthwhile seeing for marvelous landscapes and breathtaking outdoors from Yugoslavia and Croatia.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"genre":["Western","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1965-10-20","keywords":"arizona territory,arizona,apache territory,italo western,winnetou","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000851/","name":"Lex Barker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0108523/","name":"Pierre Brice"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0824389/","name":"Anthony Steel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718243/","name":"Harald Reinl"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063537/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023529/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102259/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562015/","name":"Karl May"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0677457/","name":"Harald G.

Pierre Brice is sensational as Winnetou , he is descendant of old French nobility , after enlisting as volunteer to the French Army and fighting in Indochina, he attended acting lessons and got a first small role in some film . In 1962, a German producer searched for an actor who should play the Native American chief Winnetou on a Western movie adapted from novels by Karl May and got to know Brice at the Berlin Film Festival. He got the role and portrayed "Winnetou" in ten more movies with his co-star Lex Barker as "Old Shatterhand". These very successful productions made him a superstar in Germany, winning several awards such as Bambi or the Golden Otto of teenager magazine "Bravo".

Stewart Granger took the role in two occasions ,he starred a diverse character but the role is pretty similar to Old Shatterland , he plays with mirth and liking manner as ¨Among vultures¨ and ¨Winnetou and Surehand¨ .Besides Rod Cameron starred only one : ¨Old Firehand¨ in which chemistry between stuffy Cameron and Brice is inexistent . The film displays a colorful cinematography and a catching , sensible musical score ,though with excessive use of synthesizer by Martin Bottcher , series' ordinary , being eventually replaced in some episode by Peter Thomas . The motion picture produced by Rialto Productions is professionally directed by Harald Reinl who realized various Karl May titles , besides he was a German thriller expert called Krimi - Edward Wallace adaptation- and filmed other Western as ¨The last Mohican¨ and a epic rendition , ¨Nibelungen ¨ also with Terence Hill and his wife Karin Dor ; unfortunately Harald Reinl died a few years ago , he committed suicide in Santa Cruz De Tenerife , Islas Canarias .

This enjoyable saga benefits from sensational adventures , shoot'em up , betrayals , larger-than-life characters and overwhelming scenarios shot in Spandau, Berlin, Cetina river, Krka Falls, Krka National Park, Croatia and Perucko reservoir, Yugoslavia . \n\nWinnetou-Pierre Brice repeats , as usual, his excellent role to be continued in a TV series . Brice was descendant of old French nobility and considered to be one of the most famous and most loved actors in Germany and in the other countries in Eastern Europe , thanks to this role and starred several pictures as charming Indian Winnetou . He even received First Class Medal as one the most popular Frenchmen in Germany . In 1962, the German producer Horst Wendlandt searched for an actor who should play the Native American chief and got to know Brice at the Berlin Film Festival . He got the role and portrayed "Winnetou" in ten more movies . Barker scored especially high marks , though he played as a serious and intelligent man who joins forces with Winnetou , while Stewart Granger as Old Surehand performs with humor and joy , he's the perfect counterpoint to Winnetou . Enjoyable relationship between Old Surehand and Winnetou is quite match . The highbrow Lex Barker played the most part of series : ¨Apache gold (1963)¨ by Harald Reinl, ¨Apaches last Battle (1964)¨ by Hugo Fregonese, ¨Last of renegades(1964)¨, ¨The desperate trail¨, ¨Old Surehand¨ (1965) directed by Alfred Vohrer, ¨Old Shatterland(1966)¨ by Harald Philipp, ¨In the valley of death(1968)¨ by Harald Reinl . Stewart Granger took the role in two occasions , he starred a diverse character but the role is pretty similar to Old Shatterland , he plays with mirth and sympathetic manner as ¨Among vultures¨ and ¨Winnetou and Surehand¨ . Besides , Rod Cameron starred only one : ¨Old Firehand¨ in which chemistry between stuffy Cameron and Brice is inexistent . Nice support cast such as the customary nasty Harald Leipnitz along with the Morocco woman : Macha Méril , Walter Barnes and ¡ Terence Hill ! prior his amusing films with Bud Spencer playing as Trinidad and Bambino . In fact , Terence married an American girl of Bavarian descent , and learning German language , he starred several Germanic films , before his successful Italian ones . \n\nThe film displays a colorful cinematography and a catching , sensitive musical score ,though with excessive use of synthesizer by Martin Bottcher , series's ordinary , being eventually replaced in some episode by Peter Thomas . The motion picture ¨Rampage at Apache Wells¨ or ¨Der Olprinz¨ by Harald Philipp was well produced by Rialto Film Preben-Philipse/Horst Wendlandt /Constantin . The flick was professionally directed by Harald Philipp who made all kind of genres : action , Western , Wartime , besides he was a German thriller expert called Krimi -Edward Wallace adaptation- and realized another Western titled : ¨"Winnetou and the Crossbreed" . Rating : 5.5/10 , acceptable and passable . Worthwhile seeing for marvelous landscapes and breathtaking outdoors from Yugoslavia , including rousing falls , canyon, rivers and mountains ; all of them as spectacular as Almeria -Spain- outdoors where at the same time were shot numerous European Western . In successive episodes the faithful half-brothers are ready on the trail to undertake other adventures.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1313,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Western","Adventure"],"keywords":"apache territory,apache,settler,arizona,arizona territory","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001289/","name":"Stewart Granger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0108523/","name":"Pierre Brice","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0500505/","name":"Harald Leipnitz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0679974/","name":"Harald Philipp"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102259/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023529/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043072/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562015/","name":"Karl May","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0219043/","name":"Fred Denger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0679974/","name":"Harald Philipp"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But alas, I somehow missed this one. And I'm not entirely sure how I came across it now, but it looks like it was released back in 2016, but I guess it's never late than never. So let's dig in.\n\nI think the topic of movie posters, and their ever-changing and evolving style is such a brilliant idea for a documentary. It's a topic that's rarely ever discussed anymore, except when complaining about the prices that any new Mondo release goes for. As for the state of movie posters in general, it's pretty sad, and I know I'm not the only one who really dislikes where they are right now with the big studios. Movie posters used to be an art form, just look at any of them beginning with the 20's going on through the 80's. Each decade offered a different style, but each very much an artistic endeavor, with the work being done in the 80's being a critical and commercial high point. Once we got into the 90's, it all started to change, with photography creeping into the format more and more and hand-drawn or painted artwork going out the window. And it's only gotten worse with Photoshop, where every single new film is either a floating head of the star, or a badly rendered collage of images from the film. Just look at most of Marvel's superhero films. Though I am loving DC's Wonder Woman marketing campaign and their colorful almost art deco approach to her posters, as well as Kong: Skull Island's classic artistic approach.\n\nPersonally I found this documentary to be highly enlightening, and thoroughly entertaining. It's not perfect, but a very fun way to spend 2 hours of your life, especially if you're an artist or collector of movie memorabilia. For the most part, I really enjoyed it, but I felt that it devoted too much time to the state of modern-day posters today rather than the art and skill of it in decades past. Meaning, a good chunk of this film's running time is pretty much spent on Mondo and other's like it, which is cool because they are the ones who reinvigorated the "hand-drawn movie poster" movement, but I really would have liked to have learned more about the older posters and their artists, which they do touch on early on, but I guess not enough for my liking.\n\nAt the same time it was interesting getting to see in person the artists that I currently follow, some of who's work adorns my walls, and their thoughts on the current movement and where it's headed. It also brings up an issue that I have with these new posters, and that's the flippers who buy the extremely limited quantities out within seconds and immediately flip them around for ridiculous fee's on eBay in a matter of minutes. I knew I wasn't the only one who had an issue with this and I was glad to hear from the artists themselves how it pretty much makes them sick that some (flippers) are only in it for the money and take so much away from the collectors who just want one to hang on their wall, not for profit. It's good that most new companies out there that do the same thing are mass producing them instead of limited runs of 100 like Mondo, that way anyone can get one if they want. I like that idea.\n\nDefinitely worth a watch and it's a fun one at that. Just wish so much time hadn't been spent on the current movie poster crisis, and instead focused on the classics and their lasting appeal compared to the over- Photoshopped nightmare we're currently in. But I get it, trust me I do. There's a resurgence and an urgency and art about the movie poster format and it's because of companies like Mondo and others. Hell, I still try to grab one from time to time because some of them are just too killer. One thing's for sure, watching this will definitely get you into wanting to track down some old favorites, or even check out what new artists are doing with them these days. www.robotGEEKSCultCinema.blogspot.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":686,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm not saying that if someone LIKES "Plan 9" then his or her brain probably needs to be repaired; the suspicious, unhealthy thing is not LIKING the film, but being of the opinion that it's good.  (Many people have a soft spot for it precisely BECAUSE they realise how bad it is.  In this way it differs from something like "Timecode", where either liking the film OR having a high opinion of it is something to be embarrassed about.)  And something similar applies to, say, "Citizen Kane". Disliking it makes sense; thinking it's a bad film does not.\n\nBut there's another kind of film that tempts me to be even more presumptuous.  "Dumbo" is the best example I can think of at the moment.  I can see why one might (mistakenly) have a low opinion of "Dumbo": some of the footage IS mere padding, the triumph at the end is too swift, the charge has been laid (falsely, but not ludicrously) that the crows are racist caricatures ... and so forth.  But surely even the people who think "Dumbo" is a bad film must still manage to like it.  If they don't, THEN I'm suspicious.\n\nI feel this way, to a greater or lesser degree, about a number of light comedies, and this is one of them.  I can't honestly say that I revere or adore "Bridget Jones's Diary" (N.B.: I'm male), but all the same, I can't help thinking that people who take an active dislike to it have something wrong with them.  This applies not just to the film as a whole but to Bridget Jones, the central character, in particular.  What has she done to merit dislike?  She's beautiful (as beautiful as Renée Zellweger has ever been on screen), honest and kind-hearted.  The diary she keeps certainly reveals her many flaws, but none is particularly pronounced, most are purely negative and anyway, she shares them all with the rest of us - so don't pretend you're not like this, too.\n\nThis is an amiable, well-written and fresh romantic comedy with, for ONCE, an attractive female protagonist.  It's far from being the greatest film ever made and there may be grounds for attacking it which I haven't touched upon (I suppose there always are), and so all in all I'll understand your not thinking as much of it as I do, but, dammit, you'd better LIKE it."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":230834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm not saying that if someone LIKES "Plan 9" then his or her brain probably needs to be repaired; the suspicious, unhealthy thing is not LIKING the film, but being of the opinion that it's good.  (Many people have a soft spot for it precisely BECAUSE they realise how bad it is.  In this way it differs from something like "Timecode", where either liking the film OR having a high opinion of it is something to be embarrassed about.)  And something similar applies to, say, "Citizen Kane". Disliking it makes sense; thinking it's a bad film does not.\n\nBut there's another kind of film that tempts me to be even more presumptuous.  "Dumbo" is the best example I can think of at the moment.  I can see why one might (mistakenly) have a low opinion of "Dumbo": some of the footage IS mere padding, the triumph at the end is too swift, the charge has been laid (falsely, but not ludicrously) that the crows are racist caricatures ... and so forth.  But surely even the people who think "Dumbo" is a bad film must still manage to like it.  If they don't, THEN I'm suspicious.\n\nI feel this way, to a greater or lesser degree, about a number of light comedies, and this is one of them.  I can't honestly say that I revere or adore "Bridget Jones's Diary" (N.B.: I'm male), but all the same, I can't help thinking that people who take an active dislike to it have something wrong with them.  This applies not just to the film as a whole but to Bridget Jones, the central character, in particular.  What has she done to merit dislike?  She's beautiful (as beautiful as Renée Zellweger has ever been on screen), honest and kind-hearted.  The diary she keeps certainly reveals her many flaws, but none is particularly pronounced, most are purely negative and anyway, she shares them all with the rest of us - so don't pretend you're not like this, too.\n\nThis is an amiable, well-written and fresh romantic comedy with, for ONCE, an attractive female protagonist.  It's far from being the greatest film ever made and there may be grounds for attacking it which I haven't touched upon (I suppose there always are), and so all in all I'll understand your not thinking as much of it as I do, but, dammit, you'd better LIKE it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":230834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even though he might not know why, Mark positively adores Bridget. Colin gets that and twinkles, melts and warms in all the right places. Same goes for Daniel he's drawn to his Bridge for some inexplicable reason. Hugh Grant really ought to be looking for a patent for that mojo he works so well. All of the original actors are back as Bridget's parents and her "dating war command" of pals and all have a natural, easy chemistry that works. But, the negatives, they are a-plenty.\n\nBiggest problem here was the complete tone change. In the first film, we were on the ride with Bridget...seeing things through her eyes, groaning as she put her foot in her mouth again and cheering for her to finally get it right. However, in this movie, it feels like someone stuck her up on a stage and spent 2 hours throwing pies and tomatoes at her cause it seemed real cool. She's not in on the joke here, she IS the joke. Her few extra pounds are no longer just a part of the package  they are the end-all of her worth as a person. It feels like the folks behind this film don't even LIKE the character  they just think it's real cool to humiliate her as often as possible. It doesn't even look like they bothered to send Renee to makeup or wardrobe  she (as Bridget) was pleasantly plump in the first film, but never dowdy. The character is downright frumpy in this movie with a perpetual case of bed head and clothes that look like castoffs from Mayberry. And Renee plays into it with her acting choices  Bridget was frazzled in the first movie but still retained her dignity most of the time. She's a perpetual victim in this one, though, and even though Renee is still cute as a button and incredibly endearing, some of Bridget's spark is gone.\n\nWhat happens after the happy ending? Couple realizes that they are each real, flawed people. And the movie makes it seem like Mark is at that point  never tries to change Bridget, never gets angry and her constant mishaps amuse more than annoy. But, as each of Bridget's tantrums unfolded, I kept asking myself why in the WORLD the man was still there. Bridget's keen on him but doesn't trust him. She likes to be with him but is suspicious of his actions without any real cause. Now, we know she's an insecure character and feels like she's not classy enough to fit into his world. And if the movie built from that, maybe we'd have a different story. But the obstacles they face are external. The characters never make decisions on their own  something or someone else makes them feel a certain way or forces them into a course of action that decides what will happen next. And Bridget's reactions almost make it seem like somehow, over the course of the last 'six weeks', she's regressed to a girl in the schoolyard stomping her feet when her boyfriend does something she doesn't like.\n\nAnother problem  the utter lack of subtlety. Why include one fat joke when 3 or 4 plus a butt shot can fit into the scene? Why spend most of the movie dropping hints about a reveal when you can beat the audience over the head with it in one of the final scenes? Why have Daniel make one joke about stealing Mark's wife when he can drop another one 30 minutes later? Oh look, matching Christmas jumpers  how cute. Most of the funny in this movie comes from certain 'episodes' as opposed to the dialogue. I loved the ski trip and Bridget's 'magic mushrooms' in Thailand. But, when the characters are actually talking to each other, they just aren't that funny. Most of the jokes are reruns from the first movie that feel stale. The naughty jokes are kicked up a notch but everyone in my packed theater, including me, either grimaced or sat stone-faced through most of them. Note to filmmakers: dirty has to actually BE funny to be funny.\n\nThis feels like a movie about a woman made by men who think wet clothes, girl-on-girl action and butt close-ups get it done. I read some interviews that said that Renee would only do a second film if it took care of Bridget and held up the standards of the first. I almost wonder if someone slid her this script on the first day of shooting as a rewrite once she'd already signed on the dotted line. This felt like a bleached, harsher version of the first the warmth is gone. I know there was a different director and I really don't think the new kid gets why Bridget was/is such a phenomenon. As much as I was looking forward to this film, I wish they'd never done it.\n\nOh, and also, as a P.S.  if I was a Thai woman right now, I'd be suing Working Title and Miramax for defamation of character for their version of 'Fun with Stereotypes'."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110177,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-12-29","keywords":"thailand,marriage proposal,prison,boyfriend girlfriend relationship,opposites attract","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1468053017","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM4MjQzMDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM4MjQzMDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452319/","name":"Beeban Kidron"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276144/","name":"Helen Fielding"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0203577/","name":"Andrew Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's completely inoffensive and does everything it needs to with the charm of grandma, the malice of the Grand High Witch, etc. I'm getting the feeling that these are reactionary responses to yet another 'bland and unoriginal Hollywood' trend even though this is an adaptation of Roald Dahl's book, just like the 1990 version is.\n\nIt's alright if people don't like this movie I suppose but acting like it's the worst thing to come to screens is an exaggeration to say the least. Kids are most definitely going to enjoy it, it is for them after all, not the adults comparing it to the 1990 adaptation, so I'd say this film was a success in what if wanted to do.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29556,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He's a surgeon from sophisticated, worldly London who moves to (fictional) Portwenn on the coast of Cornwall because he suddenly becomes ill at the sight of blood. This is not a good omen for a surgeon. He quits to become a general practitioner and he's satisfied, thanks very much, with checkups, prescriptions and referrals.\n\nThe foul-mannered, blunt-spoken Doc smugly considers himself above the crowd, but he soon learns he is really BELOW the crowd, out of step with Portwenn's eccentricities, value systems and peculiar burghers, who make the mere lunatics of London look normal by comparison.\n\nMartin Clunes is terrific in the lead role. He is a tall, charismatic and not exactly handsome actor who looks like he would be more comfortable playing cops and heavies. He is, instead, a consummate comic actor. His facial and physical comedy, his frequent bouts of exasperation and bewilderment, are things to behold. (Note: some wags have compared him to 'House,' from the popular TV drama of the same name. House is played by Hugh Laurie, another splendid Brit, and that's about where the comparison begins and ends. They are two very different characters in two very different shows.)\n\nPortwenn's local population, with its twisted logic that somehow makes perfect sense, is represented through the tour-de-force acting of supporting players: Bert (Ian McNeice, who always dazzles playing offbeat, world-weary philosophical characters); Louise (the charming and beautiful Caroline Catz), who either loves Martin or wants to kill him; corn-rowed Elaine (lovely Lucy Punch) as the ditzy assistant with her own set of secretarial ethics; and Doc's Aunt Joan (the great Stephanie Cole, who has been delighting audiences since the 1960s).\n\nDominic Minghella, he of the Minghella mob of talented artists (brother Anthony directed 'The English Patient'), is the brains behind this brilliant controlled chaos.\n\nDon't miss this program. TV shows that are both funny AND intelligent are the rarest of TV fare.\n\nAnd a fast footnote: let us all bow our heads and pray that Hollywood doesn't try to remake this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

All of these movies show how occults become a source of meaning, purpose, and belonging- and become an escape from the cold and isolation of reality. Like 'One flew over the cuckoo's nest,' the film offers no panacea to the horrific realities of mankind, instead focusing on articulating reality. Although it does not offer a solution, and there is no happy ending, the message may be exactly that-- that humans have the choice of hope, realism, or despair. That while realism and despair are rational, hope is literally what keeps us alive.

"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is a more confident, assured outing than the first film and while it does not draw from Mignola's comics for its plot it is perhaps better off for it, lacking the usual burden of comparison and expectations. "The Golden Army" is more fantastical than the first film and is less sci-fi oriented but this is the sort of thing Del Toro does exceptionally well as a writer.

I am convinced without a shadow of a doubt that Guillermo Del Toro's entire career has been leading up to this film, particularly regarding his work as screenwriter here. The comedy feels less forced and is worked incredibly well into the script here, so much so that it doesn't feel remotely unnatural when the scene of comic drunken singing leads directly without a break into one of the film's most intensely dramatic sequences. Del Toro's handling of character has never been better, not even with "The Devil's Backbone", which is still my favorite of his films, and his sheer skill and ability when it comes to telling a fairytale-esquire fantasy is astonishing, as proved in the prologue to this film. In short this is Del Toro at the top of his game and providing artistry the likes of which we rarely if ever see in summer blockbusters. It's only fair that an astonishingly brilliant comic like "Hellboy" by an astonishingly brilliant artist like Mike Mignola is adapted this well and by someone as talented at what they do as he is.\n\nHow refreshing it is, a week after the release of "Hancock", which to me epitomizes everything wrong with action film-making today, that we get "The Golden Army" which features hands down some of the finest action scenes we have ever seen in this sort of film. Just stunningly beautiful, well-shot, well-crafted, the sort of thing that leaves one wondering how much time and effort went into it and endlessly thankful that some really talented people went to the trouble of making the film. \n\nThe film is generally just superb on a technical level. Why am I even saying this? Of course it is. Danny Elfman composing, Guillermo Navarro serving as cinematographer, top-notch editors, fantastic special effects wizards. It's a world-class crew that made this film. I shouldn't be surprised at its quality but "The Golden Army" really just floored and astonished me with how good it is. The cast is also excellent, proving once again that you don't need 'big names' to carry a movie. Just about everyone here is excellent, particularly Perlman with another excellent turn as Hellboy and the underrated Selma Blair as Liz Sherman. \n\n"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" provides essentially everything a Del Toro or Mignola fan would want.

She is hardy and seemingly strong.  When an old man with Indian looks shows up seeking treatment, she finds that he is her father, whom she has blamed for her mother's death when he abandoned them as a child.  She rejects his attempts to apologise and sends him on his way.  When an Indian raiding party kidnaps Maggie's eldest, Lily, she has to turn to Samuel for his ability to track them.\n\nWith so few westerns being released to our multiplexes it is important not to go crazy with hype when one is released.  In the UK we will have this film and Open Range released within a few weeks of one another and nearly every review you read can't help but draw attention to that as if somehow the recent Westerns we've had are some sort of golden age.  I watched this just as I watch any film of any genre, whether the western happens to be neglected recently or not.  The plot here is basically the journey and Jones' attempts at a sort of redemption.  The film is perhaps a touch long, but it still fills the running time well.  The action stuff is good but it is also well complimented by the more emotional core.  It isn't perfect of course, but it does well and makes for an engaging and entertaining film. Of the things I'd like to have seen gone, the whole black magic side of the film didn't work for me and gave the story a mysticism that I didn't think it actually needed.\n\nThe cast are very good though.  Jones manages to actually play an unexplained white man who was `with the Indians' without it being unbearably laughable.  He is a more interesting character than the writing would have done alone or with a lesser actor.  Blanchett makes up for her dire work in LOTR with a gutsy performance that gradually transforms as the film goes. Schweig is a great baddie despite his low screentime.  It is good that the PC brigade didn't mean that this character had to be twisted in keeping with the modern cliché that all Indians are moral and upright.  Boyd is much better here than in that terrible Dickie Roberts thing.  She does have to do a little too much screaming at times but generally is up to the task. Support from Kilmer, Clint Howard and others are welcome in support and there is not really a weak link in the cast.\n\nOverall this is not a great western, and wouldn't really stand out in the genre.  However it is one of the better films out in the cinema right now. It has a good central story with reasonably good characters and it is only the mystical stuff and some weaknesses in the script that stops it being better.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT2H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Along with "The Hurt Locker" this is one of the best films about the Iraq war and a brilliant night out to boot.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134153,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-03-17","keywords":"political military conspiracy,interrogation by torture,american,female reporter,speech","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Zone: International Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi447415577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4NDIwMzQyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4NDIwMzQyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Discovering covert and faulty intelligence causes a U.S. Army officer (Damon) to go rogue as he hunts for Weapons on Mass Destruction in an unstable region.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005042/","name":"Jason Isaacs","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339030/","name":"Paul Greengrass"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2418487/","name":"Rajiv Chandrasekaran"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Some TV-shows have such a great cast, you'd keep watching simply for the joy of seeing an outstanding ensemble act. To get those kinds of actors is a rare privilege for any show, and 'Orphan Black' is very privileged, indeed. Thankfully, it also has a fascinating story to tell, and that combination makes for one of the most entertaining and most original shows on recent TV.\n\nThis review won't contain any spoilers, so I'm not going into plot details - just know that 'Orphan Black' delivers a perfect blend of mystery, sci-fi, thriller, drama and comedy elements - and many wonderfully colourful characters - that will make you want to binge-watch entire seasons. And while everybody in the cast does an outstanding job, one thing can't be stressed enough: Tatiana Maslany, the lead actress, is a revelation. It's hard not to spoil anything for those who still have the joy of watching 'Orphan Black' ahead of the them (and I think the first few episodes are enjoyed best without knowing what the show is about), but let me just say: you're not likely to see so many different aspects of one actress' amazing acting capabilities in any other show or film. \n\nSo my verdict: Worth watching for the quality of the acting alone, 'Orphan Black' offers dark thrills, edge-of-your-seat suspense - and more than a few laughs along the way. Perfect entertainment from Canada - 9 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":105319,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-03-30","keywords":"female protagonist,suicide,brainwashed assassin,mad scientist,genetic enhancement","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1137209/","name":"Tatiana Maslany","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1851313/","name":"Dylan Bruce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2849998/","name":"Jordan Gavaris"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069372/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1528935/","name":"Kim Coghill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3784672/","name":"Andrew De Angelis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3709826/","name":"Jeff Detsky"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Orphan Black - Season 3 teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1926017305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMzA2NzgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk3MDIwNTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMzA2NzgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk3MDIwNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sarah comes face to face with a new Castor clone in this sneak peek of Episode 1, which premieres Saturday, April 18th at 9/8c on BBC America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
