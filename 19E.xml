The first episode had an intriguing premise, the second episode built up the team members' characters enough to at least make them likable, and I think Michael Weatherly is enjoying the role massively and it shows in his winning performance. The psychological aspect of the show is something I don't think we see enough of on television in general and even if some of it is pumped up into quick, flashy computer bites, it still aids the story which is really all it's meant to do. As shows in their infancy go, I think this one is off to a promising start. Bull is a well-shot bit of interesting fun and I will definitely keep watching!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16256,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135585/","name":"Freddy Rodríguez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16201,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135585/","name":"Freddy Rodríguez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the "Most Wanted" episode. That episode was the Pilot for "FBI: Most Wanted" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there. Now give them the surrounding plots and characters that made S1 so good CBS. Put S1 on All Access too while you're at it!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12189,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16201,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135585/","name":"Freddy Rodríguez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is when the series starts to pick up steam. Watching the show, you can't help but laugh at Briscoe's remarks or feel the passion of McCoy. Both of these men want justice, and will do everything within limits to bring the wrongdoers to justice. What I really like about the show is the wonderful twists and turns that they throw to the audience, as well as the "ripped from the headlines" episodes.

If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the "Most Wanted" episode. That episode was the Pilot for "FBI: Most Wanted" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there. Now give them the surrounding plots and characters that made S1 so good CBS. Put S1 on All Access too while you're at it!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12189,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the "Most Wanted" episode. That episode was the Pilot for "FBI: Most Wanted" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there. Now give them the surrounding plots and characters that made S1 so good CBS. Put S1 on All Access too while you're at it!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12189,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the "Most Wanted" episode. That episode was the Pilot for "FBI: Most Wanted" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there.

So no this is not polished, but not every movie needs that polish. The pacing could be a bit tighter, but that is a personal opinion on that, you may feel different.

This is a decent movie to say the least - and it is based on real events. So there is that for sure. And it is as down and gritty as you would it expect it to be.\n\nJust the first action scene ... there's no difference between this and a Hollywood Action movie with a similar theme. So no this is not polished, but not every movie needs that polish. The pacing could be a bit tighter, but that is a personal opinion on that, you may feel different. Overall more than decent and a testament on a certain period of time and what went down (more or less) in Brazil ...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":481,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-01-23","keywords":"police,kidnapping,brazilian police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1042708/","name":"Erom Cordeiro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1499052/","name":"Thelmo Fernandes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0314078/","name":"Vanessa Gerbelli"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0025241/","name":"Vicente Amorim"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0687479/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026273/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0473686/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0025241/","name":"Vicente Amorim","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5312404/","name":"Aurélio Aragão","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2032393/","name":"Gustavo Bragança"],"duration":"PT2H14M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For better or worse this film doesn't appear to state definitively whether drinking alcohol is good or bad.

Tom Cruise, well-known for his tight control over the Mission Impossible franchise, micromanaged the 2017 remake of "The Mummy" to death. "Light of my Life" does not pretend to be a big-budget blockbuster, but its quality is undermined for a similar reason.\n\nCasey Affleck is the director, writer, and lead actor in this film. When he wrote the many monologues for the father to sermonize, no one took him aside and advised him to cut their number and length. When he delivered the monologues, no one told him that he needed to make his stuttering monotone more lilting and engaging. And clearly no one informed Casey as director that beginning the movie with a 12-minute (truth!) recitation of a Noah's Ark derivative story would kill audience interest at the outset.\n\nAnd that is the frustration I had throughout this movie. There were enough variations on the road trip theme that this could have been an enthralling movie. The father and daughter aren't merely trying to survive a post-apocalyptic environment. He needs to protect her from the real-life horrors that young women risk today, but on an astronomically larger scale.\n\nThe movie shines when it illustrates these risks and progresses the plot by driving them in their quest for the ultimate safe house. When the pair was forced to gauge the trustworthiness of new companions or they were fleeing from undesired ones, I was engaged and cheering them on. But active moments make up far too little of the film; if you watch the trailer, you've seen clips from most of them. Independent advisors would undoubtedly have counseled Affleck accordingly.\n\nThe movie also brushes past the details of both the epidemic and life after the epidemic. When the couple visited a government dispensary or the father mentioned how critical it was to have proper ID, I wanted to learn more about the world had morphed in response to the loss of half of its population. But no, the film doggedly returned to more rambling from the father as the two cower in a foxhole.\n\nI watched the whole movie because I was interested enough in the ending, but I strung it out over 3 days to minimize the tedium. If you decide to see it, fast forward through the first 12 minutes. You'll thank me, I promise.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12299,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-09","keywords":"girl dressed as boy,short haired girl,child with gun,girl dressed as a boy,rifle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi560380953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjZmU4ZWYtYTAwNS00MWNhLWE4MzMtM2JmYjQwYWNhYmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjZmU4ZWYtYTAwNS00MWNhLWE4MzMtM2JmYjQwYWNhYmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Parent and child journey through the outskirts of society a decade after a pandemic has wiped out half the world's population.

"Light of my Life" does not pretend to be a big-budget blockbuster, but its quality is undermined for a similar reason.\n\nCasey Affleck is the director, writer, and lead actor in this film. When he wrote the many monologues for the father to sermonize, no one took him aside and advised him to cut their number and length. When he delivered the monologues, no one told him that he needed to make his stuttering monotone more lilting and engaging. And clearly no one informed Casey as director that beginning the movie with a 12-minute (truth!) recitation of a Noah's Ark derivative story would kill audience interest at the outset.\n\nAnd that is the frustration I had throughout this movie. There were enough variations on the road trip theme that this could have been an enthralling movie. The father and daughter aren't merely trying to survive a post-apocalyptic environment. He needs to protect her from the real-life horrors that young women risk today, but on an astronomically larger scale.\n\nThe movie shines when it illustrates these risks and progresses the plot by driving them in their quest for the ultimate safe house. When the pair was forced to gauge the trustworthiness of new companions or they were fleeing from undesired ones, I was engaged and cheering them on. But active moments make up far too little of the film; if you watch the trailer, you've seen clips from most of them. Independent advisors would undoubtedly have counseled Affleck accordingly.\n\nThe movie also brushes past the details of both the epidemic and life after the epidemic. When the couple visited a government dispensary or the father mentioned how critical it was to have proper ID, I wanted to learn more about the world had morphed in response to the loss of half of its population. But no, the film doggedly returned to more rambling from the father as the two cower in a foxhole.\n\nI watched the whole movie because I was interested enough in the ending, but I strung it out over 3 days to minimize the tedium. If you decide to see it, fast forward through the first 12 minutes. You'll thank me, I promise.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12299,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-09","keywords":"girl dressed as boy,short haired girl,child with gun,girl dressed as a boy,rifle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi560380953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjZmU4ZWYtYTAwNS00MWNhLWE4MzMtM2JmYjQwYWNhYmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjZmU4ZWYtYTAwNS00MWNhLWE4MzMtM2JmYjQwYWNhYmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Parent and child journey through the outskirts of society a decade after a pandemic has wiped out half the world's population.

It's supposed to be a very touching movie about love worn away through the years by all kinds of torment in life, but... it just isn't quite reached the point that touches peoples' hearts yet.

But Francois had to leave before his arrival and Maxime and Daphné will spend a few days alone chatting and revealing their respective sentimental stories.\n\nEmmanuel Mouret (director and guinosta) achieves an admirable mosaic of intertwined stories. In the first place, there are two main stories, with their respective points of view: Daphné's and Maxime's, each developed with a different tone, with some voice-over introducing or commenting on the flashbacks that alternate.

The style of the story refers to various cinematographies, depending on which story and characters it is and at what point in the story we find ourselves: at times it seems like a Rohmer film and at others a very subtle humor close to Woody Allen appears, for example. Different tones of comedy (tangled, romantic, sentimental), melodrama and drama are combined, with extraordinary use of a soundtrack with classical music ranging from Purcell and Haydn to Poulenc. In this way, the sequence of scenes could also be assimilated to a series of recitatives and arias from a Mozart opera. But beyond the references and influences, the result is absolutely personal.\n\nFar from causing dispersion, the script solidly interweaves the stories, sheds new light in their recesses and the dramatic crescendo is incessant, reaching an extremely emotional climax.\n\nWithin a solid cast, Niels Schneider stands out as Maxime, a timid aspiring writer (in the antipodes of the manipulative Philippe who played in An Impossible Love or the Object of Desire in Dolan's Imaginary Loves), Camélia Jordana who brings all her expressiveness to Daphné, a film editor, Vincent Macaigne as the endearing Francois, Daphne's partner and Émilie Dequenne's Louise, with all her surprising edges.\n\nIn sum, over the course of two hours, Mouret unfolds this remarkable human comedy in the Balzacian sense, with the motives of his characters centered on desire and love and the delicate balance between what they say to each other, what they do, what they feel, what (to us and is) shown and hidden, seduction games, tacit or explicit agreements, renunciations, confusion, the imponderable.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-09-16","keywords":"paris france,cannes 2020,pregnant woman,countryside,flashback","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [VOST]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1976156441","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTczNTJiNTctOWJjYi00NDcxLTlkMmUtNGVjOTQ1ZDgzZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTczNTJiNTctOWJjYi00NDcxLTlkMmUtNGVjOTQ1ZDgzZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3874127/","name":"Camélia Jordana"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2671105/","name":"Niels Schneider"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531195/","name":"Vincent Macaigne"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609981/","name":"Emmanuel Mouret"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346444/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609981/","name":"Emmanuel Mouret"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The screenplay, directing and photography are all superb but the performance of Mikkel Følsgaard as Christian VII of Denmark was perfection. It is so difficult to act a madman acting as if he were sane and I cannot believe any actor taking an Oscar this year could have put up a better performance. Mikkel got the loudest cheer from the audience and he thoroughly deserved it. \n\nThe plot revolves around the machinations of power behind the throne of a simpleton monarch. Christian may be King but he simply wants to play like a child. He is married and fathers a son quite brutally but he loves his dog more than his family. And so a German Doctor is called to treat him. Christian befriends his physician and leaves more and more power in the hands of this foreign commoner.

The screenplay, directing and photography are all superb but the performance of Mikkel Følsgaard as Christian VII of Denmark was perfection. It is so difficult to act a madman acting as if he were sane and I cannot believe any actor taking an Oscar this year could have put up a better performance. Mikkel got the loudest cheer from the audience and he thoroughly deserved it. \n\nThe plot revolves around the machinations of power behind the throne of a simpleton monarch. Christian may be King but he simply wants to play like a child. He is married and fathers a son quite brutally but he loves his dog more than his family. And so a German Doctor is called to treat him. Christian befriends his physician and leaves more and more power in the hands of this foreign commoner. And then the Doctor falls in love with the Queen.... \n\nIt's all true and I won't tell more than that. Just go and see it as soon as you can.

Tom Cruise, well-known for his tight control over the Mission Impossible franchise, micromanaged the 2017 remake of "The Mummy" to death. "Light of my Life" does not pretend to be a big-budget blockbuster, but its quality is undermined for a similar reason.\n\nCasey Affleck is the director, writer, and lead actor in this film. When he wrote the many monologues for the father to sermonize, no one took him aside and advised him to cut their number and length. When he delivered the monologues, no one told him that he needed to make his stuttering monotone more lilting and engaging. And clearly no one informed Casey as director that beginning the movie with a 12-minute (truth!) recitation of a Noah's Ark derivative story would kill audience interest at the outset.\n\nAnd that is the frustration I had throughout this movie. There were enough variations on the road trip theme that this could have been an enthralling movie. The father and daughter aren't merely trying to survive a post-apocalyptic environment. He needs to protect her from the real-life horrors that young women risk today, but on an astronomically larger scale.\n\nThe movie shines when it illustrates these risks and progresses the plot by driving them in their quest for the ultimate safe house. When the pair was forced to gauge the trustworthiness of new companions or they were fleeing from undesired ones, I was engaged and cheering them on. But active moments make up far too little of the film; if you watch the trailer, you've seen clips from most of them. Independent advisors would undoubtedly have counseled Affleck accordingly.\n\nThe movie also brushes past the details of both the epidemic and life after the epidemic. When the couple visited a government dispensary or the father mentioned how critical it was to have proper ID, I wanted to learn more about the world had morphed in response to the loss of half of its population. But no, the film doggedly returned to more rambling from the father as the two cower in a foxhole.\n\nI watched the whole movie because I was interested enough in the ending, but I strung it out over 3 days to minimize the tedium. If you decide to see it, fast forward through the first 12 minutes. You'll thank me, I promise.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12299,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-09","keywords":"girl dressed as boy,short haired girl,child with gun,girl dressed as a boy,rifle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi560380953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjZmU4ZWYtYTAwNS00MWNhLWE4MzMtM2JmYjQwYWNhYmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjZmU4ZWYtYTAwNS00MWNhLWE4MzMtM2JmYjQwYWNhYmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Parent and child journey through the outskirts of society a decade after a pandemic has wiped out half the world's population.

Pay attention!","reviewBody":"This high quality drama is an edgy political thriller throughout, and directed brilliantly by Yoon Jong-bin. The cinematography, the strong cast, the pace, minimalist score and crafted camera work dovetail beautifully to produce a fictional re-telling of a story largely based on truth. The ideologies of two opposed political systems rooted in sister countries of North and South Korea confront one another through the actions of Kim Jong-il (Leader, General and King of the North) and the National Intelligence Service of the South. The quest of the NIS is to determine by whatever means they can devise whether the North is developing nuclear capability, and how close that may be to full militarization. Itself no simple matter! The answer the Director of the NIS is instructed to follow is: send one of his prized assets, a soldier Park (Hwang Jung-min), first to China in the guise of a greedy businessman to build a network of contacts, then if possible, eventually move on to Pyongyang, and Seoul to get close to and manipulate General Kim. Assessing the nuclear threat is agent Park's foremost priority.\n\nThat said, the already apparent complicated plot is made more so by believable lucrative and labyrinthine business dealings that have to be set-up and we follow in real time. Agent Park, now businessman Park, is under suspicion from the off and continually tested by an ever cautious communist security service chief. Any mistake by Park in his new persona will lead to exposure and imminent death. The tension and austere nature imposed by DPRK security is palpable, and makes very edgy viewing indeed.\n\nHowever, while Park progresses and begins to infiltrate into the top echelons other complications arise in his home country. The longstanding ruling Party of 50 years faces a general election in which a new opposition Democrat candidate (allegedly a covert communist sympathiser) wants to reaffirm friendships and form closer trade relations with the North. That level of uncertainty (or as seen by some NIS members, a 'threat' that the South dare not tolerate) compels many of the principle protagonists to either switch their allegiances or change their modus operandi, compounding the cinematic intrigue.\n\nIn answer to a few Imdb reviewers who suggest that this movie is slow, they could not be more wrong! To enact the largely historically truthful story in all its glorious intricacies any less accurately by going faster, while maintaining such a superb level of entertainment would be nigh on impossible. This movie is acted slickly and make no mistake is superbly directed. The long build-up in the first half seems necessary to make the story intelligible. Without giving away how the story pans out in the latter half, suffice to say, it makes for an enjoyable, entirely satisfactory, time well-spent coherent watch. Director Yoon Jong-bin especially, and others, particularly the scriptwriters, and supporting cast deserve nominations in the Best Foreign Film category at the Oscars. This film comes highly recommended.\n\nWhat could prove limiting to its worldwide box office appeal is that for English-speaking audiences the dialogue requires subtitles, and that usually reduces audience figures.

That's the point!","reviewBody":"Reading the message boards and some of the reviews for this film, I was amused (and I confess, a bit surprised) at how few viewers seemed to grasp the point. This is the sort of film that you have to think about while watching; it requires something on the part of the viewer. It's not meant to be passive entertainment. Yes, Tatou's character is annoying. Yes, Baer's character is irritating. But that's the whole idea. Tatou's "Michele" is a shallow, superficial fashion model in search of a "great cause" to identify with. (Of course, we know that no top model was ever like that, don't we!) Her constant reading of self-help books and what I like to call "bathtub philosophy" (like bathtub gin, it is home made and of dubious quality) leads her on a "spiritual quest" in the modern sense of the buzzword that spirituality has become--the search for a feel-good factor that will make her feel better about herself, her decisions and her life. Baer's "François" considers himself to be above all need for religion, heritage, even his own history. He's too intellectual (in his own eyes) to need any of those "crutches". And yet he is drawn into a relationship with the dysfunctional, needy Michele because neither one is happy with themselves and both hope to find someone to fill the gaping hole in their lives.\n\nI have known many people of this type personally...they wander from one idea, one philosophy, one country, career or "lifestyle" to another without ever really committing to anything. That's why it says "To be continued" at the end of the film: these people will search forever, without ever seeing what's right in front of their noses. Their personal movie will go on...and on...and on. When the lights come up at the end of the show of their lives, Death will take them totally by surprise.\n\nAt first, I found the choppy editing annoying and confusing; it looks like a poorly made end-of-term project for film school. But that also helps make a point. Real life doesn't follow a nice, smooth script, and you can't edit the final rushes to suit yourself. It is what it is, with all its mistakes, out-takes, missed cues and forgotten lines. This is one of those minor films that can grow on you with time, if you learn to see beyond the surface into the ideas behind the emotions. It's only "shallow" if you fixate on the reflections...the water underneath is deep, and full of surprises. No, it's not Oscar material. It will never have mass appeal. But of its kind, it's considerably better than many viewers seem to realise.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2441,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-09-26","keywords":"anti semitism,jewish,veterinarian,judaism,reference to the old testament","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046347/","name":"Edouard Baer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0220017/","name":"Julie Depardieu"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0047645/","name":"Pascale Bailly"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032072/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0850942/","name":"Alain Tasma"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0047645/","name":"Pascale Bailly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738925/","name":"Marcia Romano"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is the sort of film that you have to think about while watching; it requires something on the part of the viewer. It's not meant to be passive entertainment. Yes, Tatou's character is annoying. Yes, Baer's character is irritating. But that's the whole idea. Tatou's "Michele" is a shallow, superficial fashion model in search of a "great cause" to identify with. (Of course, we know that no top model was ever like that, don't we!) Her constant reading of self-help books and what I like to call "bathtub philosophy" (like bathtub gin, it is home made and of dubious quality) leads her on a "spiritual quest" in the modern sense of the buzzword that spirituality has become--the search for a feel-good factor that will make her feel better about herself, her decisions and her life. Baer's "François" considers himself to be above all need for religion, heritage, even his own history. He's too intellectual (in his own eyes) to need any of those "crutches". And yet he is drawn into a relationship with the dysfunctional, needy Michele because neither one is happy with themselves and both hope to find someone to fill the gaping hole in their lives.\n\nI have known many people of this type personally...they wander from one idea, one philosophy, one country, career or "lifestyle" to another without ever really committing to anything. That's why it says "To be continued" at the end of the film: these people will search forever, without ever seeing what's right in front of their noses. Their personal movie will go on...and on...and on. When the lights come up at the end of the show of their lives, Death will take them totally by surprise.\n\nAt first, I found the choppy editing annoying and confusing; it looks like a poorly made end-of-term project for film school. But that also helps make a point. Real life doesn't follow a nice, smooth script, and you can't edit the final rushes to suit yourself. It is what it is, with all its mistakes, out-takes, missed cues and forgotten lines. This is one of those minor films that can grow on you with time, if you learn to see beyond the surface into the ideas behind the emotions. It's only "shallow" if you fixate on the reflections...the water underneath is deep, and full of surprises. No, it's not Oscar material. It will never have mass appeal. But of its kind, it's considerably better than many viewers seem to realise.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2441,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-09-26","keywords":"anti semitism,jewish,veterinarian,judaism,reference to the old testament","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046347/","name":"Edouard Baer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0220017/","name":"Julie Depardieu"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0047645/","name":"Pascale Bailly"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032072/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0850942/","name":"Alain Tasma","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0047645/","name":"Pascale Bailly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738925/","name":"Marcia Romano"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's basically a tamed down shortened movie version of Money Heist, but not nearly as cleverly or suspensefully written. Plus I feel Freddie Highmore was a poor casting choice. I kept expecting some dumb equations to pop up like they do in the lame TV series he's in, The Good Doctor.

When an engineer (Highmore) learns of a mysterious, impenetrable fortress hidden under The Bank of Spain, he joins a crew of master thieves who plan to steal the legendary lost treasure locked inside while the whole country is distracted by Spain’s World Cup Final. With thousands of soccer fans cheering in the streets, and security forces closing in, the crew have just minutes to pull off the score of a lifetime. Also starring Astrid Berges-Frisbey (Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides) and Liam Cunningham ("Game of Thrones").","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2793591/","name":"Astrid Bergès-Frisbey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0727165/","name":"Sam Riley"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0049371/","name":"Jaume Balagueró"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0733175/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0854713/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0733176/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2111814/","name":"Rafa Martínez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1048541/","name":"Andrés M.

Which is why I care about it. It's one of the first trans led, trans positive shows to tell the story of lgbtq+ culture in 80s/90s New York ball scene. Yet as much as I love it, I feel half the episodes are like watching re-runs of Jem and the holograms. There's goodies and baddies for every episode, push down your throat morality lessons, and unrealistic poverty living standards. The main lesson I've learnt is that as long as your beautiful and wear amazing clothes you'll life will be fabulous. Forget hardship, just put on a lipstick, spend all your money on outfits and the gym and you'll be fine. The shows premise is amazing, the actors are great and the background stories for the main characters need telling. Yet we need to be able tell these stories in a realistic way so they can be properly understood, so that the audience can fully explore and comprehend the real drama of people's Lives. I feel Pose takes important issues and works to raise awareness but does so with so much millennial style filtering that the real meaning is lost amongst all the gloss and glitter.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24137,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-06-03","keywords":"queer,1980s,new york city,ball culture,voguing","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5049751/","name":"Michaela Jaé (MJ) Rodriguez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9500848/","name":"Dominique Jackson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8360867/","name":"Indya Moore"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0212151/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314634/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0680695/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6955079/","name":"Steven Canals","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1004299/","name":"Brad Falchuk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614682/","name":"Ryan Murphy"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1653325849","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTcxMGQyOTYtZTEyYS00Y2RiLTk3NDEtNzQzMGUzYzY2ODI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTcxMGQyOTYtZTEyYS00Y2RiLTk3NDEtNzQzMGUzYzY2ODI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"In the  final season of Pose, time flashes forward to 1994.

    <desc lang="fr">Aux Etats-Unis, de plus en plus de séries s'intéressent aux rouages de la politique et aux coulisses du pouvoir à la Maison-Blanche. En 1999, The West Wing a été l'une des premières fictions à dépeindre le quotidien du président américain et de son équipe. Cette série culte a inspiré nombre de scénaristes qui ont donné naissance à "House of cards", "Veep", "The loudest voice", ou encore "The Comey rule". Pourquoi la Maison-Blanche et son locataire inspirent-ils tant le sérail de la fiction ? Ce documentaire analyse cette tendance à travers les témoignages de producteurs et de showrunners comme Elie Attie (The west Wing), ou encore Michael Kelly (The Comey rule).</desc>

The two main characters in Billions were prominent in seasons 1-3, while in seasons 4-5 these two main characters seemed to be placed in the background.

"OSS 117 is Unleased") wasn't the first filmed adaptation of the literary hero created by writer Jean Bruce, it was the first to come out after the international success of the James Bond movie "Dr. No". Obviously, this movie was made with the intention of aping James Bond. However, if you are expecting this movie to be as hard hitting and action packed as a James Bond movie from the 1960s, you will probably be disappointed. There is more of a laid back attitude throughout instead of a feeling of tension or excitement. And there is very little action (though the few hand-to-hand combat sequences do pack some serious juice.) However, the movie is interesting that is portrays spying in a more realistic manner. There is always a feeling that whatever happens in this movie could very well have happened in real life. And while the movie does get slow at times, I personally was never bored, since the French perspective does add some charm and freshness. If you are looking for action, you better look elsewhere. But if you are tired of James Bond-style spy spoofing and want a more serious take on the subject of spying - and the idea of a French twist on the subject sounds interesting - the movie will keep you interested reasonably enough.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":251,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1963-06-19","keywords":"eurospy,psychotronic film,pipe smoking,cigarette,scotch whisky","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558663/","name":"Kerwin Mathews"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761664/","name":"Nadia Sanders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0218464/","name":"Irina Demick"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0402161/","name":"André Hunebelle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002264/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063265/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0459991/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0096306/","name":"Raymond Borel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115504/","name":"Jean Bruce"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0288218/","name":"Pierre Foucaud"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"OSS 117 is Unleased") wasn't the first filmed adaptation of the literary hero created by writer Jean Bruce, it was the first to come out after the international success of the James Bond movie "Dr. No". Obviously, this movie was made with the intention of aping James Bond. However, if you are expecting this movie to be as hard hitting and action packed as a James Bond movie from the 1960s, you will probably be disappointed. There is more of a laid back attitude throughout instead of a feeling of tension or excitement. And there is very little action (though the few hand-to-hand combat sequences do pack some serious juice.) However, the movie is interesting that is portrays spying in a more realistic manner. There is always a feeling that whatever happens in this movie could very well have happened in real life. And while the movie does get slow at times, I personally was never bored, since the French perspective does add some charm and freshness. If you are looking for action, you better look elsewhere. But if you are tired of James Bond-style spy spoofing and want a more serious take on the subject of spying - and the idea of a French twist on the subject sounds interesting - the movie will keep you interested reasonably enough.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":251,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1963-06-19","keywords":"eurospy,psychotronic film,pipe smoking,cigarette,scotch whisky","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558663/","name":"Kerwin Mathews","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761664/","name":"Nadia Sanders","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0218464/","name":"Irina Demick"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0402161/","name":"André Hunebelle"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002264/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063265/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0459991/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0096306/","name":"Raymond Borel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115504/","name":"Jean Bruce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0288218/","name":"Pierre Foucaud"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The story is all about Lady Hamilton and her unhappy marriage, her love for Nelson, and the consequences of leaving her stodgy husband to live adulterously and with the man she loved.

    <desc lang="fr">Vivien Leigh, actrice britannique vingtenaire quasi inconnue, décroche le rôle de Scarlett O’Hara dans «Autant en emporte le vent» à la fin des années 1930. Sa prestation sera récompensée par l’Oscar de la meilleure actrice. Surfant sur sa notoriété, Vivien Leigh enchaîne cinq longs-métrages avant de remporter, en 1952, un second Oscar pour son incarnation bouleversante de Blanche DuBois dans «Un tramway nommé désir». Un tournage compliqué pour l’artiste, diagnostiquée bipolaire, qui est sujette à des crises au cours desquelles elle balance entre exaltation et abattement. Jusqu’à la fin de sa vie et malgré sa santé mentale vacillante, Vivien Leigh n’a cessé de travailler au cinéma comme au théâtre.</desc>

A newspaper reporter, Casey Mayo (Richard Conte), sees a chance for a big story that might jump start his career as a journalist. The media begins to tout the mystery lady as the tantalizing "Blue Gardenia." \n\n"The Blue Gardenia" has all the marks of a great murder mystery in the tradition of "Laura," written by the same person, Vera Caspary. But for some reason, lack of money, lack of time, Fritz Lang wraps the entire project up much too soon. The ending is so abrupt that it appears thrown together as if in the middle of a scene the director yells out, "Wrap it up," and leaves the set. Yet, that's the only major flaw in the film.

I came out of my local art house quivering. Even now, as I write, I detect a hint of paranoia.  I would go as far as to say Orson Welles' The Trial is the most frightening film I've ever beheld. Watching it for the first time it's safe to say I hated it.  There were scenes that held me so close to the edge of madness, it was all I could do not to fly screaming out of the theater.  Only afterwards, on the way home, did I realize that its ability to do so was what made the film so remarkable.  Definitely a must see, but be forwarned.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20514,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1962-12-22","keywords":"dystopia,judicial system,surrealism,paranoia,kafka esque","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Trial","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2136456217","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUwOTExYmUtMmYwNi00NDA0LWFlNGUtZTA1NjI0Yzg1ZDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUwOTExYmUtMmYwNi00NDA0LWFlNGUtZTA1NjI0Yzg1ZDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000578/","name":"Anthony Perkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0289450/","name":"Arnoldo Foà","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0353916/","name":"Jess Hahn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000080/","name":"Orson Welles"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057637/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086394/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017070/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0158971/","name":"Pierre Cholot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0434525/","name":"Franz Kafka","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000080/","name":"Orson Welles"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He has been completely surpassed in the public esteem by his British contemporary David Lean. After the success of Reed's English films, a period which began in 1940 with the coal-mining film "The Stars Look Down" and ended with "The Outcast of the Islands" in 1954, the director was discovered by the big Hollywood studios; he went on to direct a number of big-budgeted Technicolor international productions -"Olivier," "The Agony and the Ecstasy," and "Trapeze"all of which he handled with consummate professionalism, but somehow their box-office success unfairly diminished his reputation with the critics. He is perhaps best remembered today for "The Third Man," which many people erroneously think Orson Welles directed. Although Reed's early films were shot in London films studios and on location all around the word, they remain quintessentially British in understated mood and attack --B&amp;W films made in collaboration with the best expatriate talent that had gathered in London during the war years. ("The Fallen Idol" is photographed by the French cinematographer Perinal, the Jugoslavian editor Hafenrichter, and the Hungarian set designer Vincent Korda.) Reed at his best has the unique ability to portray the most complex of human relationships with voices lowered; witness how masterfully he directs the detectives and suspects in the final reels of this superb film."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1948-10-25","keywords":"london england,boy,witness,fire escape,british noir","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Fallen Idol","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3770726937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y1YjQ5ZWUtMzcyZi00ZDFkLWJhMDEtYWQ4MzQ4NDhhN2E5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y1YjQ5ZWUtMzcyZi00ZDFkLWJhMDEtYWQ4MzQ4NDhhN2E5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Fallen Idol"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724732/","name":"Ralph Richardson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006807/","name":"Michèle Morgan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0237520/","name":"Sonia Dresdel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0715346/","name":"Carol Reed"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103018/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001294/","name":"Graham Greene"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0832593/","name":"Lesley Storm"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0854789/","name":"William Templeton"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He has been completely surpassed in the public esteem by his British contemporary David Lean. After the success of Reed's English films, a period which began in 1940 with the coal-mining film "The Stars Look Down" and ended with "The Outcast of the Islands" in 1954, the director was discovered by the big Hollywood studios; he went on to direct a number of big-budgeted Technicolor international productions -"Olivier," "The Agony and the Ecstasy," and "Trapeze"all of which he handled with consummate professionalism, but somehow their box-office success unfairly diminished his reputation with the critics. He is perhaps best remembered today for "The Third Man," which many people erroneously think Orson Welles directed. Although Reed's early films were shot in London films studios and on location all around the word, they remain quintessentially British in understated mood and attack --B&amp;W films made in collaboration with the best expatriate talent that had gathered in London during the war years. ("The Fallen Idol" is photographed by the French cinematographer Perinal, the Jugoslavian editor Hafenrichter, and the Hungarian set designer Vincent Korda.) Reed at his best has the unique ability to portray the most complex of human relationships with voices lowered; witness how masterfully he directs the detectives and suspects in the final reels of this superb film.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1948-10-25","keywords":"london england,boy,witness,fire escape,british noir","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Fallen Idol","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3770726937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y1YjQ5ZWUtMzcyZi00ZDFkLWJhMDEtYWQ4MzQ4NDhhN2E5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Y1YjQ5ZWUtMzcyZi00ZDFkLWJhMDEtYWQ4MzQ4NDhhN2E5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Fallen Idol","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724732/","name":"Ralph Richardson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006807/","name":"Michèle Morgan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0237520/","name":"Sonia Dresdel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0715346/","name":"Carol Reed"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103018/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001294/","name":"Graham Greene","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0832593/","name":"Lesley Storm","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0854789/","name":"William Templeton"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Without any money, they seek a job position for saxophone and bass players in another band and they are invited to play in a concert for one night only in a distant town. Joe borrows the car of a former girlfriend to travel and when they arrive in the parking garage, they witness the "Saint Valentine's Day Massacre" led by the infamous mobster Spats Columbo (George Raft). The criminals discover Joe and Jerry hidden in a corner and when the killers are ready to execute them, they succeed to escape. Joe and Jerry disguise, dressing like women and they head to Florida by train with an all-girl band using the names of Josephine and Daphne. They get close to singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) and Joe falls in love with her but she believes he is a woman. Meanwhile the millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) harasses Daphne inviting her to visit his yacht. When Spats and his henchmen arrive in the same hotel where Joe and Jerry are lodged for a mafia convention, the two musicians feel that they are in a dangerous situation.\n\nYesterday Tony Curtis died and I decided to watch "Some Like it Hot" again. This film is another masterpiece of Billy Wilder and certainly one of the best comedies of the cinema history. Jack Lemmon is hilarious and responsible for some of the funniest moments especially when Osgood flirts with Daphne. Marilyn Monroe performs the perfect dumb blonde stereotype. Last time I had seen this movie was on 18 August 2000. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Quanto Mais Quente Melhor" ("The Hotter, the Better")","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Comedy","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"1959-03-19","keywords":"sex comedy,comedy of errors,disguise,all girl band,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Some Like It Hot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2371683353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for the classic comedy Some Like It Hot, starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000054/","name":"Marilyn Monroe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000348/","name":"Tony Curtis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000493/","name":"Jack Lemmon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047869/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011112/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224634/","name":"I.A.L.

Without any money, they seek a job position for saxophone and bass players in another band and they are invited to play in a concert for one night only in a distant town. Joe borrows the car of a former girlfriend to travel and when they arrive in the parking garage, they witness the "Saint Valentine's Day Massacre" led by the infamous mobster Spats Columbo (George Raft). The criminals discover Joe and Jerry hidden in a corner and when the killers are ready to execute them, they succeed to escape. Joe and Jerry disguise, dressing like women and they head to Florida by train with an all-girl band using the names of Josephine and Daphne. They get close to singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) and Joe falls in love with her but she believes he is a woman. Meanwhile the millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) harasses Daphne inviting her to visit his yacht. When Spats and his henchmen arrive in the same hotel where Joe and Jerry are lodged for a mafia convention, the two musicians feel that they are in a dangerous situation.\n\nYesterday Tony Curtis died and I decided to watch "Some Like it Hot" again. This film is another masterpiece of Billy Wilder and certainly one of the best comedies of the cinema history. Jack Lemmon is hilarious and responsible for some of the funniest moments especially when Osgood flirts with Daphne. Marilyn Monroe performs the perfect dumb blonde stereotype. Last time I had seen this movie was on 18 August 2000. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Quanto Mais Quente Melhor" ("The Hotter, the Better")","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Comedy","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"1959-03-19","keywords":"sex comedy,comedy of errors,disguise,all girl band,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Some Like It Hot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2371683353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for the classic comedy Some Like It Hot, starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000054/","name":"Marilyn Monroe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000348/","name":"Tony Curtis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000493/","name":"Jack Lemmon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047869/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011112/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224634/","name":"I.A.L.

Only a curmudgeon would not laugh aloud during some of the scenes.\n\nThe plot, briefly, involves a clever bank clerk (Guiness) developing a plan with a die caster (Holloway) to steal several million pounds of gold bullion, recast it into tourist knicknacks in the shape of Eiffel Tower paperweights, and ship it to Paris to sell on the black market. They recruit two professional thieves to help them.\n\nIt may not be Ealing's best comedy (my vote would be for "The Lady Killers") but it's more than funny enough. I'll just give three scenes as examples.\n\n(1) Holloway and Guiness, two honest men, need to recruit what they call a "mob" but have no idea how to go about it. What I mean is -- how would YOU go about recruiting criminal assistants? What they do is go to crowded places of low repute -- saloons, prize fights, the underground -- and shout at each other through the noise about the safe being broken at such-and-such an address and all that money having to be left in it. Then they hole up at the address and wait for the burglars to arrive.\n\n(2) A scene at the Eiffel Tower in which they discover that half a dozen of the gold paperweights instead of the usual leaden ones have been sold to some English schoolgirls. They watch horrified as the door closes and the elevator carrying the girls begins its descent, and they decide to rush down the tightly spiraling staircase to ground level, trying to beat the elevator. By the time they reach the street they've been spun around so many times that they can't stop laughing and are unable to stop twirling around until they fall down.\n\n(3) After the robbery, in an empty warehouse soon to be searched by the police, Guiness must be tied up, gagged, and blindfolded with tape. Then his clothes must be torn and dirtied so that it appears he put up a fight before the gold was taken. But the police arrive too soon, and the others beat it, leaving Guiness standing alone, tied up, and blindfolded, but not dirty. He stumbles about blindly, trying to blow the tape from his mouth, getting his feet caught in discarded bicycle wheels, until he falls into the Thames.\n\nProbably the weakest part of the movie is near the end, when police cars wind up chasing one another because of confusing messages. The scene could have been lifted from Laurel and Hardy. It's a little silly. (Why didn't Guiness and Holloway park the stolen car, get out, and walk away?) But that's a minor consideration.\n\nWhat surprises me about some of these comedies is that they're able to make us laugh despite the dreary atmosphere. The streets of London look awfully dismal in this grainy black and white film. Some of them were still charred wrecks left over from the Blitz. But it doesn't dampen the comedy at all. Following the successful robbery a drunken Guiness and Holloway return to their boarding house to be chided by their landlady for being "naughty". One pulls the other aside, chuckling conspiratorially, and the two agree to call each other "Al" and "Dutch" -- two REAL BIG gangsters for you.\n\nIf you need to use up some neuropeptides this is your movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13627,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1951-09-10","keywords":"france,paris france,scotland yard,eiffel tower paris,gold","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lavender Hill Mob","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1599585305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWU5OTRjNDAtNzcxMS00NzJhLTk2MjUtNjgxODgwODI2MjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWU5OTRjNDAtNzcxMS00NzJhLTk2MjUtNjgxODgwODI2MjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000027/","name":"Alec Guinness"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0391361/","name":"Stanley Holloway"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416228/","name":"Sidney James"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0187769/","name":"Charles Crichton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0546727/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040024/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165021/","name":"T.E.B.

If "The Blue Gardenia" is to be classified at all, it would possibly be labeled lighter Noir.\n\nOf the interplay between the room mates, Ann Sothern as Crystal with her biting wit and mock delivery, is the highlight.

Norah Larkin gives in to this sexual predator in a moment of weakness following the receipt of a Dear John letter from her sweetheart overseas. Prebble, true to form, proceeds to get Norah drunk at The Blue Gardenia as a prelude to seduction. In the process of attempting to woo her with words in his apartment, Prebble becomes more forceful when Norah revives long enough to realize Prebble's true intentions. When she awakes in the morning she finds Prebble dead. Norah has only a hazy recollection of a poker being swung and a mirror shattering. All else is blank.\n\nAssigned to the investigation is Police Capt.Sam Haynes (George Reeves of TV "Superman" fame, showing all the earmarks of a great actor before being typecast on television), who seeks to wrap the case up quickly by apprehending the mystery lady who was seen with Prebble at The Blue Gardenia just before his death. A newspaper reporter, Casey Mayo (Richard Conte), sees a chance for a big story that might jump start his career as a journalist. The media begins to tout the mystery lady as the tantalizing "Blue Gardenia." \n\n"The Blue Gardenia" has all the marks of a great murder mystery in the tradition of "Laura," written by the same person, Vera Caspary. But for some reason, lack of money, lack of time, Fritz Lang wraps the entire project up much too soon. The ending is so abrupt that it appears thrown together as if in the middle of a scene the director yells out, "Wrap it up," and leaves the set. Yet, that's the only major flaw in the film. Otherwise, watch and enjoy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5107,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir"],"datePublished":"1953-03-28","keywords":"title based on song,color in title,murder,telephone,telephone operator","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000879/","name":"Anne Baxter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002017/","name":"Richard Conte"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815433/","name":"Ann Sothern"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000485/","name":"Fritz Lang"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0233672/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0388841/","name":"Charles Hoffman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0143837/","name":"Vera Caspary"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the process of attempting to woo her with words in his apartment, Prebble becomes more forceful when Norah revives long enough to realize Prebble's true intentions. When she awakes in the morning she finds Prebble dead. Norah has only a hazy recollection of a poker being swung and a mirror shattering. All else is blank.\n\nAssigned to the investigation is Police Capt.Sam Haynes (George Reeves of TV "Superman" fame, showing all the earmarks of a great actor before being typecast on television), who seeks to wrap the case up quickly by apprehending the mystery lady who was seen with Prebble at The Blue Gardenia just before his death. A newspaper reporter, Casey Mayo (Richard Conte), sees a chance for a big story that might jump start his career as a journalist. The media begins to tout the mystery lady as the tantalizing "Blue Gardenia." \n\n"The Blue Gardenia" has all the marks of a great murder mystery in the tradition of "Laura," written by the same person, Vera Caspary. But for some reason, lack of money, lack of time, Fritz Lang wraps the entire project up much too soon. The ending is so abrupt that it appears thrown together as if in the middle of a scene the director yells out, "Wrap it up," and leaves the set. Yet, that's the only major flaw in the film. Otherwise, watch and enjoy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5107,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir"],"datePublished":"1953-03-28","keywords":"title based on song,color in title,murder,telephone,telephone operator","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000879/","name":"Anne Baxter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002017/","name":"Richard Conte","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815433/","name":"Ann Sothern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000485/","name":"Fritz Lang"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0233672/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0388841/","name":"Charles Hoffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0143837/","name":"Vera Caspary"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Several escape attempts follow until they are eventually sent to a seemingly inescapable fortress.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0028950/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Lechuguilla"},"dateCreated":"2006-10-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"Its Historical Significance Is No Illusion","reviewBody":"Franklin Roosevelt said of it: "Everyone who believes in democracy should see this film". Mussolini banned it in Italy, and Hitler's Ministry of Propaganda banned it in Nazi Germany. The film vanished during WWII, and was thought to have been destroyed. Then it was recovered in 1946, but in an altered state. Decades would then pass before the original negative could be confirmed.\n\nThe Nazis hated the film because of its pacifist, anti-war, theme. The setting for the film is Germany in 1914, during WWI. Germans capture several French officers and take them to a POW camp, specifically for officers. After several escape attempts, the French officers get shuffled off to a presumably escape proof castle, run by Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim), a flamboyant German officer with a forbidding persona.\n\nUnlike other war movies, "La Grande Illusion" shows no actual combat, and the number of deaths is minimal. The film's tone is surprisingly lighthearted. Writer/Director Renoir conveys a sense of community among the French prisoners, despite their differences in social class. We see them several times sitting around a table eating, and chatting amiably. The cordiality between prisoners and their jailers is also surprising. It's not exactly a hug fest, but the predominant feeling among the men is respect for fellow officers, even if those officers are your enemy. None of the French or German officers want war; it's just their "duty", when called on.\n\nIn most of the film, scenes take place in small rooms or in that castle. Toward the film's end, outdoor vistas provide a visual contrast. Except at the film's end, I was amazed at how drab the surroundings are. Room furnishings are unadorned and contain the barest of essentials. Tables and floors are made of simple wood. The clothes are dreary and depressing. The stone castle is dank and forbidding. Music is made with simple instruments, like a harmonica or a flute. Of course, given the time period and considering the setting, such drabness and simplicity are not surprising. But the contrast with today's complex world of modern luxuries, that we take for granted, is striking. The film's B&amp;W cinematography accentuates the drab environment.\n\nThe story can be a bit confusing in the first half, because the relationship between the jailers and the prisoners is so unusual. Viewers need to give the film wide latitude on this. Watching the film a second time helps clarify who is doing what to whom.

Several escape attempts follow until they are eventually sent to a seemingly inescapable fortress.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0028950/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Lechuguilla","dateCreated":"2006-10-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"Its Historical Significance Is No Illusion","reviewBody":"Franklin Roosevelt said of it: "Everyone who believes in democracy should see this film". Mussolini banned it in Italy, and Hitler's Ministry of Propaganda banned it in Nazi Germany. The film vanished during WWII, and was thought to have been destroyed. Then it was recovered in 1946, but in an altered state. Decades would then pass before the original negative could be confirmed.\n\nThe Nazis hated the film because of its pacifist, anti-war, theme. The setting for the film is Germany in 1914, during WWI. Germans capture several French officers and take them to a POW camp, specifically for officers. After several escape attempts, the French officers get shuffled off to a presumably escape proof castle, run by Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim), a flamboyant German officer with a forbidding persona.\n\nUnlike other war movies, "La Grande Illusion" shows no actual combat, and the number of deaths is minimal. The film's tone is surprisingly lighthearted. Writer/Director Renoir conveys a sense of community among the French prisoners, despite their differences in social class. We see them several times sitting around a table eating, and chatting amiably. The cordiality between prisoners and their jailers is also surprising. It's not exactly a hug fest, but the predominant feeling among the men is respect for fellow officers, even if those officers are your enemy. None of the French or German officers want war; it's just their "duty", when called on.\n\nIn most of the film, scenes take place in small rooms or in that castle. Toward the film's end, outdoor vistas provide a visual contrast. Except at the film's end, I was amazed at how drab the surroundings are. Room furnishings are unadorned and contain the barest of essentials. Tables and floors are made of simple wood. The clothes are dreary and depressing. The stone castle is dank and forbidding. Music is made with simple instruments, like a harmonica or a flute. Of course, given the time period and considering the setting, such drabness and simplicity are not surprising. But the contrast with today's complex world of modern luxuries, that we take for granted, is striking. The film's B&amp;W cinematography accentuates the drab environment.\n\nThe story can be a bit confusing in the first half, because the relationship between the jailers and the prisoners is so unusual. Viewers need to give the film wide latitude on this. Watching the film a second time helps clarify who is doing what to whom. The plot is easier to follow in the second half.\n\nThe film's acting is credible. I especially liked the performance of von Stroheim, all decked out in that imposing uniform, that monocle, and with that stiff bearing.\n\n"La Grande Illusion" is an unusual "war" film, one that had real significance during WWII. For this reason alone, it deserves to be seen.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1937-10-04","keywords":"military,french soldier,upper class,prisoner of war camp,christmas","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grand Illusion: 75th Anniversary","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1344124953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQxZTlhOGQtMmNlYy00Y2IyLWI3YmUtMjZjMTQ3MDJhNWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQxZTlhOGQtMmNlYy00Y2IyLWI3YmUtMjZjMTQ3MDJhNWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Grand Illusion","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0300064/","name":"Jean Gabin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0663077/","name":"Dita Parlo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0294382/","name":"Pierre Fresnay"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0719756/","name":"Jean Renoir"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053790/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0816458/","name":"Charles Spaak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0719756/","name":"Jean Renoir"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Coming along at a crossroads section in French fornication film history, with simulation rapidly rendered obsolete by full color penetration, Unia felt commercially compelled to retrieve his labor of love from domestic distribution at the eleventh hour, sprucing up its mildly naughty shenanigans with pornographic pickup shots, a common practice at this stage in the evolution of European erotic cinema. A similar fate befell his follow-up feature, LE PIED! a/k/a FLAT OUT, but at least this time around several of the original cast members (including Béatrice Harnois, Frédérique Barral and Pamela Stanford) stepped up to the plate to perform the "offensive" acts themselves. Realizing there was no way back, Unia embraced his new source of employment, churning out competently crafted carnal capers, albeit at a more reverential rate than his brethren in slime.\n\nCharacterized by both ecological concerns and an oddly protofeminist sensibility, allowing amorously autonomous heroines to challenge phallocratic patriarchy, his concise body of work was initially taken at face value by otherwise knowledgeable scribes as that of a female filmmaker, the anagrammatic "Reine Pirau" ! ESTELLE ET FLORA, with its devil may care eponymous erotic explorers, could serve as a prototype of the director's idiosyncratic approach, taken to Utopian extremes with B...COMME BEATRICE's harmonious matriarchal farming community. Subverting the myth of the rape of the Sabine women, L'ENLEVEMENT DES SABINES had a group of sexually disgruntled women joining forces against male egotism. Even though there's a price to pay for their defiance, a recurring turn of events throughout Unia's explicit endeavors, his female characters have the last word, obtaining vengeance both sophisticated and unexpected for the unbridled male violence inflicted upon them, a knee-jerk reaction towards their mates' challenging an increasingly antiquated status quo.\n\nAttempting to emulate EMMANUELLE's continued box office drawing power, with video rental and cable TV a reliable secondary source of income, Unia scheduled a brief return to real name respectability with a score of four tame trifles, all of which amazingly opened alongside Hollywood blockbusters at Paris first run theaters. Nobody's fool, the director made sure to shoot simultaneous - if sometimes substantially different - hardcore versions to maximize potential profits. Last as well as least of the lot, OUTRAGE AUX MOEURS approximates a cheapskate rendition of the already sordid if marginally popular (due in no small part to their pulp print source) BRIGADE MONDAINE skin-heavy "thrillers" searching to expose such tabloid-friendly subjects as white slavery and drug trafficking.\n\nThirtysomething movie mogul Claude Farrell ("Chris Garini" a/k/a porn performer Ghislain Garet, prominently featured in Gérard Kikoïne's NEVER ENOUGH) has the hots for aspiring actress Grendy Daumier (Valérie Houlier), star of his latest not-quite-porn blockbuster DORTOIR DES GRANDES - in reality, Unia's previous simulated opus COLLEGE DORMITORY - and at least a decade his junior. Unaware she's using him to further her career, with frequent trips to the tropical isle of St. Barts a pleasant bonus (not least in terms of production value), Claude receives the proverbial wake up call coming back from business earlier than expected to find Grendy giving it up to a lowly delivery guy. Shooting his rival for the unworthy tramp's affections, he goes on the lam, seeking refuge on a houseboat inhabited by another pair of cinema hopefuls, down to earth Chantal (Laetitia Thomas) and round-heeled Carla ("Ghislaine Kerdavid" a/k/a Michelle Davy, star of Michel Lemoine's LOVE IN PARADISE) who respond to Claude's disruptive presence in radically different ways. While Chantal seizes each opportunity to alert outsiders for help, Carla just comes on to him ! \n\nWhat little plot there is plays better as (albeit unintentional) comedy with wholly implausible situations - like Claude accompanying Chantal on a porn dubbing session since they both could do with the cash ?! - and some of the most wooden acting ever inflicted upon a paying audience. Ironically the sole cast member foregoing fornication film experience, totally talent-barren Houlier proves the prime offender with the fake tan sporting Garet a close contender. Frizzy-haired Thomas, who starred in Unia's simultaneously shot FESSES VIERGES A L'ESSAI AUX CARAIBES only to disappear without a trace, tries hard but is forced to face defeat by a belated change of heart turning her character into a complete moron. Ultimately, the delightful Davy comes off best, perpetually naked and wisely entrusted with most of the sex scenes.

Coming along at a crossroads section in French fornication film history, with simulation rapidly rendered obsolete by full color penetration, Unia felt commercially compelled to retrieve his labor of love from domestic distribution at the eleventh hour, sprucing up its mildly naughty shenanigans with pornographic pickup shots, a common practice at this stage in the evolution of European erotic cinema. A similar fate befell his follow-up feature, LE PIED! a/k/a FLAT OUT, but at least this time around several of the original cast members (including Béatrice Harnois, Frédérique Barral and Pamela Stanford) stepped up to the plate to perform the "offensive" acts themselves. Realizing there was no way back, Unia embraced his new source of employment, churning out competently crafted carnal capers, albeit at a more reverential rate than his brethren in slime.\n\nCharacterized by both ecological concerns and an oddly protofeminist sensibility, allowing amorously autonomous heroines to challenge phallocratic patriarchy, his concise body of work was initially taken at face value by otherwise knowledgeable scribes as that of a female filmmaker, the anagrammatic "Reine Pirau" ! ESTELLE ET FLORA, with its devil may care eponymous erotic explorers, could serve as a prototype of the director's idiosyncratic approach, taken to Utopian extremes with B...COMME BEATRICE's harmonious matriarchal farming community. Subverting the myth of the rape of the Sabine women, L'ENLEVEMENT DES SABINES had a group of sexually disgruntled women joining forces against male egotism. Even though there's a price to pay for their defiance, a recurring turn of events throughout Unia's explicit endeavors, his female characters have the last word, obtaining vengeance both sophisticated and unexpected for the unbridled male violence inflicted upon them, a knee-jerk reaction towards their mates' challenging an increasingly antiquated status quo.\n\nAttempting to emulate EMMANUELLE's continued box office drawing power, with video rental and cable TV a reliable secondary source of income, Unia scheduled a brief return to real name respectability with a score of four tame trifles, all of which amazingly opened alongside Hollywood blockbusters at Paris first run theaters. Nobody's fool, the director made sure to shoot simultaneous - if sometimes substantially different - hardcore versions to maximize potential profits. Last as well as least of the lot, OUTRAGE AUX MOEURS approximates a cheapskate rendition of the already sordid if marginally popular (due in no small part to their pulp print source) BRIGADE MONDAINE skin-heavy "thrillers" searching to expose such tabloid-friendly subjects as white slavery and drug trafficking.\n\nThirtysomething movie mogul Claude Farrell ("Chris Garini" a/k/a porn performer Ghislain Garet, prominently featured in Gérard Kikoïne's NEVER ENOUGH) has the hots for aspiring actress Grendy Daumier (Valérie Houlier), star of his latest not-quite-porn blockbuster DORTOIR DES GRANDES - in reality, Unia's previous simulated opus COLLEGE DORMITORY - and at least a decade his junior. Unaware she's using him to further her career, with frequent trips to the tropical isle of St. Barts a pleasant bonus (not least in terms of production value), Claude receives the proverbial wake up call coming back from business earlier than expected to find Grendy giving it up to a lowly delivery guy. Shooting his rival for the unworthy tramp's affections, he goes on the lam, seeking refuge on a houseboat inhabited by another pair of cinema hopefuls, down to earth Chantal (Laetitia Thomas) and round-heeled Carla ("Ghislaine Kerdavid" a/k/a Michelle Davy, star of Michel Lemoine's LOVE IN PARADISE) who respond to Claude's disruptive presence in radically different ways. While Chantal seizes each opportunity to alert outsiders for help, Carla just comes on to him ! \n\nWhat little plot there is plays better as (albeit unintentional) comedy with wholly implausible situations - like Claude accompanying Chantal on a porn dubbing session since they both could do with the cash ?! - and some of the most wooden acting ever inflicted upon a paying audience. Ironically the sole cast member foregoing fornication film experience, totally talent-barren Houlier proves the prime offender with the fake tan sporting Garet a close contender. Frizzy-haired Thomas, who starred in Unia's simultaneously shot FESSES VIERGES A L'ESSAI AUX CARAIBES only to disappear without a trace, tries hard but is forced to face defeat by a belated change of heart turning her character into a complete moron. Ultimately, the delightful Davy comes off best, perpetually naked and wisely entrusted with most of the sex scenes. Stateside audiences may recall she starred (as "Nicole Vartan") in Jourdan Alexander's passable sequel TAXI GIRLS 2. Truncated orgy footage - check out FESSES VIERGES for the "inside scoop" ! - showcases a plethora of recognizable porn performers like mustachioed Jacky Arnal, incredible hunk Eric Saville, chunky Frank Balard, Karoline Houtart (the chubby-cheeked chick in a nun's habit also appearing in Michel Barny's AMOUR, FANTASMES ET FANTAISIE) plus a veritable who's who of Michel Lemoine cast-offs including Amanda Shell (FORBIDDEN PLEASURES), Chantal Trobert (MARILYN MON AMOUR) and Mina Houghe (HOT DESIRES). DoP Yves Dahan, who subsequently found his niche on French TV, makes the most of movie's exotic locations yet fails to enliven the pedestrian Paris portion, notwithstanding back to back car crashes, only one of which bears any tangential relation to the nonsensical narrative.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1985-11-06","keywords":"erotic thriller,female nudity,topless female nudity,sex on the beach,barefoot woman","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307455/","name":"Ghislain Garet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859126/","name":"Laetitia Thomas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0205849/","name":"Michelle Davy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881245/","name":"Pierre Unia"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014381/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881245/","name":"Pierre Unia"],"duration":"PT1H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In Egypt, they apparently frown on attempts to solve crimes committed by top government figures. And to get information or to get out of trouble, everything has a price. Money is always changing hands. The viewer wonders if the detective will ever get the chance to find the killer. \n\nSounds like an interesting murder mystery, but truth be told, it's not as exciting or mysterious as it could be. Director Tarik Saleh tries mightily but his efforts come up short. "The Nile Hilton Incident" is heavy on atmosphere but lacks clarity to hold the audience's interest.

In Egypt, they apparently frown on attempts to solve crimes committed by top government figures. And to get information or to get out of trouble, everything has a price. Money is always changing hands. The viewer wonders if the detective will ever get the chance to find the killer. \n\nSounds like an interesting murder mystery, but truth be told, it's not as exciting or mysterious as it could be. Director Tarik Saleh tries mightily but his efforts come up short. "The Nile Hilton Incident" is heavy on atmosphere but lacks clarity to hold the audience's interest. Corruption, graft and bribery abound and the bleak, washed out color photography is in keeping with the squalid streets of the Egyptian cities and the moral underpinnings of local officials. The 'perp' is known early on but his identity gets lost the muddled mix of names and titles of all the government employees involved.

The plot moves snappily for the first half of the film, but almost every twist is predictable, and the pace begins to drag, hiccuping along into the second half.

To make matters worse, I was very unsatisfied by the climax and resolution.  To what degree Koepp deserves the blame for these mismatched, unpleasant elements I do not know, but in my opinion he hasn't written a great script since Jurassic Park, which had all the comedy of Panic Room, but must have stolen the suspense from the second half.\n\nOverall, I'd give this movie 2 out of 5.

The film is about his widow's struggle to prove that he wasn't a murderer and didn't practice torture while he was leading a ground unit during the Algeria war.\n\nShe decides to sue the man who accused him of being a torturer and thus begins an investigation which retraces the Captain's last 2 weeks, day by day.\n\nThe actors are awesome, which is pretty common in Schoendoerffer's movies. The storyline is using numerous flashbacks depicting battle scenes in Algeria, hunts for terrorists and shots of the Captain's previous life (resistant in WW2 and prisoner in Indochina).\n\nAll in all this is a very humanistic movie which main message could be that war is rarely a matter of Good Vs Evil, but rather a matter of Good Vs another Good.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":243,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"genre":["War"],"datePublished":"1982-12-29","keywords":"french military,french algerian war,french soldier,slander,libel suit","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0674742/","name":"Jacques Perrin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305368/","name":"Nicole Garcia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0219342/","name":"Charles Denner"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006954/","name":"Pierre Schoendoerffer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017320/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154377/","name":"Jean-François Chauvel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006954/","name":"Pierre Schoendoerffer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0948558/","name":"Daniel Yonnet"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The film is about his widow's struggle to prove that he wasn't a murderer and didn't practice torture while he was leading a ground unit during the Algeria war.\n\nShe decides to sue the man who accused him of being a torturer and thus begins an investigation which retraces the Captain's last 2 weeks, day by day.\n\nThe actors are awesome, which is pretty common in Schoendoerffer's movies. The storyline is using numerous flashbacks depicting battle scenes in Algeria, hunts for terrorists and shots of the Captain's previous life (resistant in WW2 and prisoner in Indochina).\n\nAll in all this is a very humanistic movie which main message could be that war is rarely a matter of Good Vs Evil, but rather a matter of Good Vs another Good.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":243,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["War"],"datePublished":"1982-12-29","keywords":"french military,french algerian war,french soldier,slander,libel suit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0674742/","name":"Jacques Perrin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305368/","name":"Nicole Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0219342/","name":"Charles Denner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006954/","name":"Pierre Schoendoerffer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017320/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154377/","name":"Jean-François Chauvel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006954/","name":"Pierre Schoendoerffer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0948558/","name":"Daniel Yonnet"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Luc wants to follow in his father's footsteps as a menuisier (cabinet maker), but we never find out why, and never hear why it's so important to him that he would decide to go to Paris for three years to get a diploma in it from the most select school in France.

Fortunately, it's worth the ride.\n\nOriginally made for the French TV series 'Cinéma De Notre Temps' by a fellow outsider, the Iranian filmmaker Rafi Pitts, this isn't any kind of proper biog of the man and his controversial canon. Rather it is a grimy depiction of a larger-than-life talent going about his business - and everybody else's - bewildering strangers with an ingratiating charm.\n\nIt's a perfect approach for the subject matter. As Pitts later explained, "I knew that an interview situation wasn't going to give us any new information about Abel. The best way to portray him was to show him how he is." How much of this persona is a put-on, or whether he's genuinely unhinged, is unclear. But he's quite a vision - a hunched, cackling scarecrow in a pink NY Yankees baseball cap "for the gay ball players".\n\nElsewhere we find him shooting a music video, banging a piano, and rehearsing with actors - during which he appears at his most lucid, even tender. More delicious is the fact that, given his determined isolationism, the majority of people don't actually know who he is. At one point he'll tell a group of bemused bystanders (presumably wondering why a film crew is hanging on a madman's every delirious whim) that he's the subject of a series called 'Last Day On Earth' - "they film dying people". \n\nWoe betide those who attract his ire. He berates a fellow driver at the traffic lights from his cab window, "It's my world - and you ain't part of it!" The connection between the man and his characters - wild, sad, or utterly alone - is made explicit; Ferrara, a Bronx native, is keeping it real. On nights like these - at least in his head - he really is the King of New York.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"genre":["Documentary"],"actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0202409/","name":"Jean-Claude Dauphin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479351/","name":"André S.

Perhaps people are reacting to the insidiousness of the world of corporate espionage, pornography, lovelessness, pleasurelessness, etc. on display in every corner of the movie. Although its final 30 minutes or so veer toward incoherence--the meaning of what ultimately happens seems less interesting as a resolution than in (for example) "Mulholland Drive"--it's a cool, controlled, provocative rethinking of the modern techno thriller. It's a far more subtle and nuanced movie than the kind of head trip movies that kids go for these days ("Requiem for a Dream," bleh!), and the Sonic Youth score and cinematography are terrific.\n\nI was originally attracted to the film on the strengths of Assayas' other films--all three I've seen ("Irma Vep", "Late August/Early Sept.", "Les Destinees Sentimentales") excellent and each in its own way unique.

Perhaps people are reacting to the insidiousness of the world of corporate espionage, pornography, lovelessness, pleasurelessness, etc. on display in every corner of the movie. Although its final 30 minutes or so veer toward incoherence--the meaning of what ultimately happens seems less interesting as a resolution than in (for example) "Mulholland Drive"--it's a cool, controlled, provocative rethinking of the modern techno thriller. It's a far more subtle and nuanced movie than the kind of head trip movies that kids go for these days ("Requiem for a Dream," bleh!), and the Sonic Youth score and cinematography are terrific.\n\nI was originally attracted to the film on the strengths of Assayas' other films--all three I've seen ("Irma Vep", "Late August/Early Sept.", "Les Destinees Sentimentales") excellent and each in its own way unique. His work is eclectic and unpredictable in the best sense, seemingly at ease with big or small productions--in the great tradition of Jonathan Demme or Michael Winterbottom or Louis Malle. This is probably the only one of his films so far that could have attracted an American audience, but the chilliness of its surfaces apparently has scared a few too many away.

I love David Fincher, and he does not disappoint in terms of direction.  In general, it's full of great visuals.  The opening sequence and a couple other scenes are an incredible testament to the realistic computer graphics available today.  Color, focus, angle, and a myriad of other elements also make this film stimulating visually.

The plot moves snappily for the first half of the film, but almost every twist is predictable, and the pace begins to drag, hiccuping along into the second half. On a positive note, there is a great deal of dead-on comedy woven into the lulls; but afterwards it almost feels forced.  Also, gore was added to the film for no apparent reason.  To make matters worse, I was very unsatisfied by the climax and resolution.  To what degree Koepp deserves the blame for these mismatched, unpleasant elements I do not know, but in my opinion he hasn't written a great script since Jurassic Park, which had all the comedy of Panic Room, but must have stolen the suspense from the second half.\n\nOverall, I'd give this movie 2 out of 5.

To me, everything else in the film seems to be subplots or minor characters. Much time is spent on portraying Vatel as a hardworking, bright and noble person.

Brainy but reclusive, she is so driven to create good work that her life is consumed with writing and research. Not only that, she is now bunking with her parents, for her old apartment has to be "fumigated". Naturally, her parents want Mary to experience love, marriage, and children so they keep trying to get her out of the house. Setting her up with the son of close friends, Mary reluctantly agrees to go out with Steve (Bradley Cooper). But, oh joy! Steve is a looker and has an intriguing job as the cameraman for a cable news reporter, Hartman (Thomas Haden Church). Mary likes, likes, likes what she sees. But, since the puzzle-writer won't stop talking and makes heavy romantic advances, Steve gets spooked only minutes into their first date and he bolts, citing his need to get to a new work assignment. But, Mary is dizzy in love. She bumbles her next crossword duties, gets fired and, suddenly, decides to follow Steve to his current location, and the next one, too. Steve is horrified and tries to get rid of her but Hartman tells Mary, privately, that Steve is secretly happy she is there and that she should not get discouraged in her pursuit of love. Its a puzzlement! Will Mary get her heart's desire? In the world of romantic comedies, this one is an odd duck. It is interesting and has many good elements but doesn't achieve overall success. However, its weaknesses do not include the cast, for Bullock, Cooper, and especially Haden Church, are great. All of the supporting cast members are very fine, too. In fact, its the actors' skills that elevate the film beyond its script and tentative direction. Yes, it tries to make some good statements about individuality, media hype, and the like. But, it never totally succeeds in getting its points across with aplomb. On a lesser note, the costumes and sets are quite nice indeed. In short, if you love Bullock, Cooper, Haden Church or quirky movies, you might give this one a whirl.

Fortunately for us, Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper. With all the actors playing surprisingly likable characters, who's opposing chemistry works impeccably when put together. \n\nI usually find that most of the time, films that parade around claiming to be comedies, usually with one famous face to show, are often just not funny. But 'We're The Millers' was actually a good comedy; probably not in a witty sophisticated way, but it made me laugh. This film also has its emotions, in their own little unconventional ways, considering the leads were not exactly your average person. \n\nIf I had to think of the one thing that I found extremely obnoxious, it would have to be Ed Helms.

Fortunately for us, Jennifer Aniston plays a stripper. With all the actors playing surprisingly likable characters, who's opposing chemistry works impeccably when put together. \n\nI usually find that most of the time, films that parade around claiming to be comedies, usually with one famous face to show, are often just not funny. But 'We're The Millers' was actually a good comedy; probably not in a witty sophisticated way, but it made me laugh. This film also has its emotions, in their own little unconventional ways, considering the leads were not exactly your average person. \n\nIf I had to think of the one thing that I found extremely obnoxious, it would have to be Ed Helms. Everything about his character and his acting, was just annoying, which is probably why the ending made me quite happy. \n\nWorth watching if you need a no-brainer to spike your mood.

But I kept grabbing my I-pad to something more interesting and/or exciting. The story and developments could have been done in 30 minutes. But alas, they did it in 90 minutes, leading to too little pace, too little jokes and scenes that do not matter. On the other hand, if you feel like a couch potato, like I did while watching, than it flows nicely, not expecting anything from you as a spectator. But if you do not see this one, you did not miss anything important.\n\nSo for you who are still interested the storyline: Jean-Jacques is a highly creative chef, but his imaginative duck rolls are not at all appreciated by his boss.

But I kept grabbing my I-pad to something more interesting and/or exciting. The story and developments could have been done in 30 minutes. But alas, they did it in 90 minutes, leading to too little pace, too little jokes and scenes that do not matter. On the other hand, if you feel like a couch potato, like I did while watching, than it flows nicely, not expecting anything from you as a spectator. But if you do not see this one, you did not miss anything important.\n\nSo for you who are still interested the storyline: Jean-Jacques is a highly creative chef, but his imaginative duck rolls are not at all appreciated by his boss. The time has come for him to leave his secure job behind and open his own restaurant... Claude is a instructor for corporate entrepreneurs, but he would prefer to be a writer. It's time for him to give it all up and finally write his novel...

Pedro Almodovar's 2016 production is one of those films that captivates the viewers during the whole duration of the screening because of the mastering of story telling and by using human emotions. Other directors may do the same thing by making recourse to thrills or horror or intellectual curiosity but it's hard to keep the attention alive for the whole duration of a long feature film. It's not the case here – as a viewer in a cinema hall I lived every moment of this story together with its (mostly female) heroes, and I keep thinking and caring about the characters hours after the screening finished. I believe that the conditions are met for the first 10 out of 10 grade on my IMDb scale in years.\n\nMany of the previous films of Almodovar are about love and loss, about communication with and without words, about death and passion and the fragile border between them. What seems to be different in 'Julieta' is the more tender approach and also a message that seems to be more assertive that in many other movies of the Spanish maestro – there are dangers in being lonely and in not being capable to communicate with those you care about.\n\nThe social landscape where the film takes place is the same Spain in evolution from the democratic awakening of the late 70s and early 80s with its breaking of tradition and liberation of passions until the today with its cold and antiseptic kind of connections in the bourgeois or intellectual circles. The family cell is the one that seems to perpetuate not necessarily the traditions but also the cheating and domestic crises in a repetition that one can accept or revolt with all the risks taken. Julieta's profession – a teacher of Greek and mythology, and a good one – puts her in the position to connect between the day to day banality of sentiments and the greater forces of destiny, but her problem resides mainly in the lack of communication with her daughter. Are the walls between generations unavoidable? Is it us who build these walls or is it just destiny that rises them in each generation? Can anything but time turn these walls down? \n\nAs in any great movies there are several levels of story. There is a story of relationship between mother and daughter, and of coming of age. There are threads about family relations that perpetuate for generations, about men who cheat, women who try to balance marriage, mothering, and their own realization, young maids who steal husbands, old maids who talk too much, social differences that can only be hidden but not erased. Death seems to be around the corner at many moments, so is physical incapacity and the pain of coping with the decay of the dear ones – these are some of the recurring themes in the movies of the Spanish master.\n\nAs in many of Almodovar's films its the women characters who share most of the load (although this film also features one sensitive man as a key supporting character). The two actresses that play Julieta at the two stages of her life – Adriana Ugarte as a young woman, Emma Suárez as her elder self are both superb in taking turns to tell the story of a woman who loves and fears, loses all and searches back to find her compass in life. The way the story is written we learn about many of the details and discover some of the hidden threads together with the character. This helps us feel and resonate with her. The elegant casting and direction help us understand that while guilt may pass in between generations, there is always hope, and reconciliation is possible sometimes when not too many questions are asked.

Looked it up on IMDb; not so good - an average of 5/10. Scroll down further and voilà! Written by Tom Hanks himself, gotta see it. And I'm glad I did.\n\nFirst, let me get the 'acting' part out of the way - It's good. Not mind-blowing, but most certainly good enough to be worth the US$9 weekend price of a movie ticket here in Singapore. The actors were good enough that I felt connected, and that's as good as it ever has to be.\n\nAs for the plot - nothing jaw-droppingly complicated and twisted, but then again neither was Forest Gump. And what a big success that movie proved to be. Don't expect character development to blow you away, but it did, at the very least, impress me.\n\nOf course, if you walk into the theater expecting "Harold &amp; Kumar" or "Chuck &amp; Larry" humor, you would most definitely be sorely disappointed. Some others have criticized the film, saying that it had "cheap laughs" at best. Now that isn't necessarily true, because it all depends on what your expectations are.\n\nSo hear this - Larry Crowne isn't an all-out-LOL-fest, it's a wholesome film sprinkled with subtle, clever, and thoughtful humor.\n\nIn my opinion, this film was an excellent cross-section representation of the sandwiched American Middle-class - too rich to qualify for welfare, too poor to save any money. Most people (outside the United States) wouldn't know the America shown throughout this film - where folks are priced out of their own states, where they attend community colleges that aren't crazy over keg parties and crawling with bikini-straddling blonds, where students have to juggle work and school, where they might have to choose the former over the latter too often.\n\nHollywood glamorizes the American lifestyle each and every chance it gets, and this film provides a rare glimpse into the real America where most people reside.\n\nAll things considered, I would consider this film a feel-good movie, and there's much more to it than meets the eye. If you enjoyed Forest Gump, you'd most likely enjoy this one - even if the feel-goodness sets in slightly more subtly.\n\nOne final thing - I've never written a review for any movie before, ever. But I felt that the reviews here (as of 9th July 11) were doing Larry Crowne such injustice that I had to write this to balance it out.\n\nCheers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65756,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-07-01","keywords":"character name as title,unsuccessful,male protagonist,feet,high heels","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Larry Crowne - Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1973459993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxOTc0NDY2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0NTk1NQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxOTc0NDY2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0NTk1NQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After losing his job, a middle-aged man (Tom Hanks) reinvents himself by going back to college."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2089529/","name":"Sarah Mahoney"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251081/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0889522/","name":"Nia Vardalos"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But I felt that the reviews here (as of 9th July 11) were doing Larry Crowne such injustice that I had to write this to balance it out.\n\nCheers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65756,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-07-01","keywords":"character name as title,unsuccessful,male protagonist,feet,high heels","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Larry Crowne - Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1973459993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxOTc0NDY2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0NTk1NQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxOTc0NDY2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0NTk1NQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After losing his job, a middle-aged man (Tom Hanks) reinvents himself by going back to college.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2089529/","name":"Sarah Mahoney"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251081/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0889522/","name":"Nia Vardalos"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The boats look good!\n\nThe chunks missed out from the original story do give the film a slightly "chopped" feeling - it's difficult sometimes to work out how the characters got where they are. \n\nThe acting lets the film down a bit, I think. The best of the Swallows is Titty by quite a long way - Susan is OK, but nothing special, and the boys are both awful - the worst kind of declamatory child acting.

The boats look good!\n\nThe chunks missed out from the original story do give the film a slightly "chopped" feeling - it's difficult sometimes to work out how the characters got where they are. \n\nThe acting lets the film down a bit, I think. The best of the Swallows is Titty by quite a long way - Susan is OK, but nothing special, and the boys are both awful - the worst kind of declamatory child acting. The Amazons are pretty good, but as they feature less in the book the bad acting of John and Roger really does spoil the film a bit.

It is truly wonderful to see how Winter's story inspires and gives hope to those facing life's challenges. I am so pleased to see CMA get the recognition they so deserve for all the good work they have done over the years. No doubt they will continue to work miracles as they have done with Winter and her friends!! Don't let the PG rating hold you back from taking the little ones. My two kids (under 7) did just fine. In my opinion could very well be a G rated movie.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23325,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-09-23","keywords":"competition,bare chested male,father figure,beach,medical examination","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dolphin Tale: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1353554969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1Nzc0NTQ2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU2MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1Nzc0NTQ2OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU2MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A story centered on the friendship between a boy and a dolphin whose tail was lost in a crab trap.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001065/","name":"Harry Connick Jr."],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001747/","name":"Charles Martin Smith"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054452/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0328433/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332172/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0418321/","name":"Karen Janszen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238247/","name":"Noam Dromi"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Along with their three kids, they leave Rio and fly to the Amazonian rain forest where an entire flock of blue macaws was reportedly spotted. As it turns out, the flock exists and is headed by Jewel's long lost father Eduardo (Andy Garcia) and guarded by her old flame Roberto (Bruno Mars).

It's been tunneling through a gold mine ever since. While Rio 2 might seem like a cash cow for some viewers, it is still a delightful animation with foot-tapping music to get your groove on.

    <title lang="fr">Le papillon</title>
    <desc lang="fr">Le papillon: Directed by Philippe Muyl. With Michel Serrault, Claire Bouanich, Nade Dieu, Jacques Bouanich. This is the story of a young girl named Elsa who was raised by a single mother (Isabelle) in the city. Isabelle and Elsa begin the film moving in next door to an elderly man who collects butterflies (Julien). Isabelle who "spends a lot of time with her friends" does not pay much attention to her daughter who walks home because her mother forgot to pick her up from school. After meeting her new neighbor, Elsa finds out about the butterflies and in short annoys Julien for a while. Julien receives a mystery package from a fellow entomologist. Julien sets out on his annual attempt to find a rare species of butterfly that he had once promised his son he would find (son dead) in the French country side, specifically a region known as Vercors. Elsa stows away in his car. After being discovered she convinces him to let her come to Vercors with him. They bond while hiking and camping until Julien, who is initially annoyed by Elsa, near the end of the film seems to have a grandfather-granddaughter relationship with her. Elsa falls in a well. The police arrest Julien. Elsa tells everyone it is cool. Isabelle starts paying attention to her child. Julien and Elsa are friends. The mystery package contained a caterpillar which turned out to become the rare species of butterfly Julien set out to find. The species is called Isabelle. So Elsa finds her mother (Isabelle) and Julien finds the butterfly (Isabelle).

It is good to see a movie that is not the normal mindless Hollywood dribble. If you walk away not feeling touched in some way by this movie, then you need to go to the wizard and get a heart. \n\nMaybe the symbolism is simple (i.e., the caterpillar becomes a butterfly scenario), but it still resonates and is an important lesson from which we all can and should benefit. Maybe we should all be like the characters in this film who start out flawed, yet find a greater sense of self, worth, and duty.\n\nDo yourself a favor: go buy this movie.

They bond while hiking and camping until Julien, who is initially annoyed by Elsa, near the end of the film seems to have a grandfather-granddaughter relationship with her. Elsa falls in a well. The police arrest Julien. Elsa tells everyone it is cool. Isabelle starts paying attention to her child. Julien and Elsa are friends. The mystery package contained a caterpillar which turned out to become the rare species of butterfly Julien set out to find. The species is called Isabelle. So Elsa finds her mother (Isabelle) and Julien finds the butterfly (Isabelle).

It is good to see a movie that is not the normal mindless Hollywood dribble. If you walk away not feeling touched in some way by this movie, then you need to go to the wizard and get a heart. \n\nMaybe the symbolism is simple (i.e., the caterpillar becomes a butterfly scenario), but it still resonates and is an important lesson from which we all can and should benefit. Maybe we should all be like the characters in this film who start out flawed, yet find a greater sense of self, worth, and duty.\n\nDo yourself a favor: go buy this movie. I promise you will not be disappointed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2940,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"butterfly,vercors,caterpillar,single mother,hiking","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1014479385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3MTM1YjYtNTAzOS00ZDk2LWE3MDQtMWI3NjQ2YWY1NWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3MTM1YjYtNTAzOS00ZDk2LWE3MDQtMWI3NjQ2YWY1NWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785664/","name":"Michel Serrault","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1237271/","name":"Claire Bouanich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0226383/","name":"Nade Dieu"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003974/","name":"Philippe Muyl"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012976/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022162/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003974/","name":"Philippe Muyl"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Adam McKay's "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" is no exception. Seems that my taste for high concept cinema has been influenced by the summer-- well not really. This movie written by McKay and it's star Will Ferrell is an outrageous and completely over the top comedy. Applaud Will Ferrell as the mind bendingly stupid and self absorbed, San Diego newscaster, Ron Burgundy. Will Ferrell is genius in playing Ron straight without character dispersions. Ferrell creates a great deadpan sense with his cohabiting dog, Baxter, and the fact that his character Ron Burgundy will read ANYTHING on the teleprompter, his tragic flaw, well at least one of several, is priceless. Ferrell also never crosses the line of being a complete jerk which is an amazing accomplishment. In fact, Ferrell gives Ron a muted charm-- he really does grow on you. \n\nBasically, "Anchorman" is an extended sitcom. Ron is informed by his station manager, Ed (a funny Fred Willard), that he will have a co-anchor, Veronica Corningstone (a hot Christina Applegate). Turns out that Veronica was a woman whom was immune to Ron's vast charm at a wild news crew party. Veronica is beautiful, ambitious, and smart. She too has aspirations of being a Network Anchor. The Boys Club news crew which include sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), feature story guy Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and the dumb as a post weatherman Brick Tamland (Steven Carell) all make their play for Veronica. However, she falls for Ron in spite of himself. Ron eventually woos her affections in a totally wacky jazz flute display. The screen writing is so skewed in a good way, and it has absolutely no shame. There is a classic scene with Ron's dog Baxter, and a bridge that according to my bud, John, shatters a fundamental script writing rule. In another memorable scene Ron gives an erroneous translation of the name San Diego to Veronica that is hilarious. "Anchorman" also benefits from cameos of talented actors, most notably Vince Vaughn as Wes Mantooth, the rival station anchor. Christina Applegate looks great, and truly has a talent for comedy. \n\n"Anchorman" is completely over the top, and ignores any boundaries. That really makes it work. "Anchorman" is broad stroke farce done well. Will Ferrell demonstrates great comedic gifts. I want to see what he creates next.

Many vibrant colours are featured, and although the don't burst of the screen like Rio, it does add to the aesthetics of the film. Yet, it does feel like the film is very self contained, but it doesn't impact it in a good way. The setting explored (or not) has a lack of scope and the film clearly suffers from this. But for kids, this will not be a problem.\n\nDespite strong design and animation, the direction is nothing notable. There are a maximum of two slightly interesting ideas (in the form of transitions) but other than that, everything else seems average, with no courageous attempts add to adding anything to the story.\n\nUnfortunately, the film falls flat on the storytelling (particularly through dialogue) which just results in everything being cliché and predictable; it brings nothing new to the table. It appears that the writers just gave up, a shame considering if the dialogue wasn't so forced then the film wouldn't suffer so much. There isn't even an innuendo to keep the adults entertained. \n\nThis film is a good way to keep the kids occupied for 90mins, but nothing that adults will obtain any pleasure from (unless you are in awe of the animation which I doubt you will be).","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-30","keywords":"parrot,storm,goat,robinson crusoe character,computer animation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1531492121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODA2MjkyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE4ODQ3OTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODA2MjkyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE4ODQ3OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"On a tiny exotic island, an outgoing parrot and his quirky animal companions befriend a marooned Robinson Crusoe.  When their harmonious lives are disrupted by two savage cats, they discover the true power of friendship against all odds."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0777788/","name":"Matthias Schweighöfer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0945883/","name":"Kaya Yanar"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2558242/","name":"Ilka Bessin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1062463/","name":"Vincent Kesteloot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823721/","name":"Ben Stassen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562775/","name":"Mimi Maynard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063902/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214518/","name":"Daniel Defoe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0661549/","name":"Domonic Paris"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Many vibrant colours are featured, and although the don't burst of the screen like Rio, it does add to the aesthetics of the film. Yet, it does feel like the film is very self contained, but it doesn't impact it in a good way. The setting explored (or not) has a lack of scope and the film clearly suffers from this. But for kids, this will not be a problem.\n\nDespite strong design and animation, the direction is nothing notable. There are a maximum of two slightly interesting ideas (in the form of transitions) but other than that, everything else seems average, with no courageous attempts add to adding anything to the story.\n\nUnfortunately, the film falls flat on the storytelling (particularly through dialogue) which just results in everything being cliché and predictable; it brings nothing new to the table. It appears that the writers just gave up, a shame considering if the dialogue wasn't so forced then the film wouldn't suffer so much. There isn't even an innuendo to keep the adults entertained. \n\nThis film is a good way to keep the kids occupied for 90mins, but nothing that adults will obtain any pleasure from (unless you are in awe of the animation which I doubt you will be).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-30","keywords":"parrot,storm,goat,robinson crusoe character,computer animation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1531492121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODA2MjkyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE4ODQ3OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODA2MjkyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE4ODQ3OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"On a tiny exotic island, an outgoing parrot and his quirky animal companions befriend a marooned Robinson Crusoe.  When their harmonious lives are disrupted by two savage cats, they discover the true power of friendship against all odds.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0777788/","name":"Matthias Schweighöfer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0945883/","name":"Kaya Yanar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2558242/","name":"Ilka Bessin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1062463/","name":"Vincent Kesteloot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823721/","name":"Ben Stassen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562775/","name":"Mimi Maynard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063902/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214518/","name":"Daniel Defoe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0661549/","name":"Domonic Paris"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Now she plans to grow up and no sooner does Robbie (Johnson) come to her school, and Georgia instantly falls for him.\n\nAfter the disappointing adaptation of St Trinians and the decline of British cinema generally over recent years this adaptation appeared to be screened as a mere money making hour and a half entertainment rom-com flick. But thanks to some cheeky youthful performances, a witty script and an underlining message of coming of age, this adaptation of Louise Rennison's best selling novel brings back that feeling of unashamedly British.\n\nIn her first leading role Georgia Groome (London to Brighton) carries the film on a charismatic and charming persona that will have the teenage girls laughing their heads off. Her smart timing and in particular her reactions to situations create that comedy feeling that was an essential factor to making the narrative work.\n\nThe film undoubtedly starts poorly. When Georgia turns up at a party, it is more than likely she will be an outcast and the fact that she gets embarrassed in front of her enemy and has to change her life is even more so. Nevertheless the comedic approach to the coming of age is likable and hardly clichéd. There is some background to her motion to change and the way she looks at adulthood as a place of comfort is as likable as her cat. The changes she goes through are sweet and realistic given today's modern outlook on the world. In this adaptation, we see many stereotypes and a very accurate look at teen language. The 'oh my god's' will have anyone laughing. The perception of girl's views on boys is a stand out moment.\n\nThe stereotypical representations are usually never right. Either they are extremely over exaggerated, for example in controversial drama Kidulthood or they are unnoticeable passive representations such as in St Trinians. The angle on the characters in this 2008 comedy feels right, not over the top with a good sense of purpose and an underlining message of coming of age.\n\nThough good fun, the plot wavers into cliché at the end and doesn't quite have enough punch to believe the arrival of British comedy is truly back.\n\nHaving never read the book, I find myself considering after enjoying the good nature of this film. Critics have said the book is funnier, and considering the amount of laughs spilled during the film, it must be an option.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26970,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-07-25","keywords":"persian cat,male objectification,love triangle,cleavage,feline","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Angus, Thongs - Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3074162969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMjA2NjI2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc0MjczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMjA2NjI2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTc0MjczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer: Based on the International best-selling series of books by Louise Rennison, the film follows the eccentric and irresistible Georgia Nicolson as she overcomes the trauma of being a teenager and moves up the ‘snogging scale’."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2102872/","name":"Georgia Groome"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1093951/","name":"Aaron Taylor-Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131627/","name":"Karen Taylor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149446/","name":"Gurinder Chadha"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245613/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104373/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239926/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149446/","name":"Gurinder Chadha"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0074488/","name":"Paul Mayeda Berges"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0574509/","name":"Will McRobb"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He is the French Anthony Hopkins with his empty stare and menacing yet sophisticated appearance.\n\nNot as great in the tension department as "Truands" but still a highly enjoyable exercise in suave and style at which the French are so good. 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":385,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-04-23","keywords":"running out of fuel,police officer,watch,lie,lying","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi745454105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E2YTM4ODMtMTRlNi00ZmRiLWIyM2QtOTkzZDJhYTBkNDJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E2YTM4ODMtMTRlNi00ZmRiLWIyM2QtOTkzZDJhYTBkNDJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0487254/","name":"Gérard Lanvin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0034390/","name":"Niels Arestrup","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0856500/","name":"Sylvie Testud"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0774420/","name":"Frédéric Schoendoerffer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050869/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0460784/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0584770/","name":"Simon Michaël","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410707/","name":"Philippe Isard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0109730/","name":"Yann Brion"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I should have but I guess the reason was that I thought the premise was silly. Too bad because this is a terrific action film. It's very entertaining but I stress that it's not dumb. All the actors deliver good performances. Benjamin Walker creates a fantastic hero in Abraham Lincoln, a secret vampire hunter and the 16th President of the United States. Walker is good in the action scenes as well as at delivering Lincoln's historic lines. He begins hunting vampires as a young man with the assistance of his mentor Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper). Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Lincoln's wife Mary Todd and Anthony Mackie plays his closest friend William Johnson. Rufus Sewell as Adam is the film's main antagonist, a powerful vampire with an interesting story. The film is based on Seth Grahame-Smith's mashup novel of the same name. It plays very much like a comic book movie, and it takes liberties with the facts of Lincoln's life while poking fun at some of them. Director Timur Bekmambetov has a talent for creating impressive visuals, but here with the assistance of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel the look of the film is often stunning. The scene in which Lincoln fights Jack Barts on horseback at sunset is just one amazing highlight. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter earned almost twice its budget at the box office but it should have been a bigger hit. It's serious fantasy horror. I won't be surprised if it becomes a cult movie. It's one of the best films of 2012, and I definitely recommend seeing it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":152144,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2012-06-21","keywords":"vampire hunter,undead,shopkeeper,abraham lincoln character,vampire","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2367398425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NDU1NzA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE2MzY4Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NDU1NzA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE2MzY4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When President Lincoln's mother is killed by a supernatural creature, he embarks on a mission to kill vampires and their slave-owning helpers.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0907548/","name":"Benjamin Walker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001722/","name":"Rufus Sewell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1002641/","name":"Dominic Cooper"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0067457/","name":"Timur Bekmambetov"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0348593/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042742/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0301801/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I should have but I guess the reason was that I thought the premise was silly. Too bad because this is a terrific action film. It's very entertaining but I stress that it's not dumb. All the actors deliver good performances. Benjamin Walker creates a fantastic hero in Abraham Lincoln, a secret vampire hunter and the 16th President of the United States. Walker is good in the action scenes as well as at delivering Lincoln's historic lines. He begins hunting vampires as a young man with the assistance of his mentor Henry Sturges (Dominic Cooper). Mary Elizabeth Winstead plays Lincoln's wife Mary Todd and Anthony Mackie plays his closest friend William Johnson. Rufus Sewell as Adam is the film's main antagonist, a powerful vampire with an interesting story. The film is based on Seth Grahame-Smith's mashup novel of the same name. It plays very much like a comic book movie, and it takes liberties with the facts of Lincoln's life while poking fun at some of them. Director Timur Bekmambetov has a talent for creating impressive visuals, but here with the assistance of cinematographer Caleb Deschanel the look of the film is often stunning. The scene in which Lincoln fights Jack Barts on horseback at sunset is just one amazing highlight. Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter earned almost twice its budget at the box office but it should have been a bigger hit. It's serious fantasy horror. I won't be surprised if it becomes a cult movie. It's one of the best films of 2012, and I definitely recommend seeing it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":152144,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2012-06-21","keywords":"vampire hunter,undead,shopkeeper,abraham lincoln character,vampire","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2367398425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NDU1NzA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE2MzY4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2NDU1NzA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzE2MzY4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When President Lincoln's mother is killed by a supernatural creature, he embarks on a mission to kill vampires and their slave-owning helpers.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0907548/","name":"Benjamin Walker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001722/","name":"Rufus Sewell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1002641/","name":"Dominic Cooper"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0067457/","name":"Timur Bekmambetov"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0348593/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042742/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0301801/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

To paraphrase a character from the movie, I knew he had it in him. But knowing and actually seeing are two different things. The movie has an old school feel to it - and yet not. It builds slowly, maybe too slowly for most people's taste. Slowly, subtly, steadily; like the bass line of a Foo Fighters song. Like a lazy snake that uncoils in the sun. Like Chi in meditation. It picks up its pace only after 40 minutes or so. But until then, the audience is given plenty of details, hints and reference to work with - if so inclined. And when things do start happening, it's beautiful to watch. Yes, it does have a few stiff and/or formulaic moments but given the genre and it being a directorial debut, this was inevitable ;) Also, in spite of the genre and the references/homages to other movies,Reeves' directing style is original.He might have been inspired by the masters, but he doesn't borrow from any of them. Like Tiger, Reeves created his own style: ironic,realistic, minimalist, sharp, punctual, complex,subtle, multi-layered. Although being promoted as a 'kung-fu movie', Man of Tai Chi is much more than that. It's a meditation on many aspects and trappings of today's life. But none of them are spelled out in neon letters; it's up to the audience to recognize them. All in all, it's like... a Chinese menu: there's something in it for everyone, but some of the dishes are not everyone's favorites... \n\nIf there's one thing the movie fan in me wanted more of, it's real interaction between Reeves' and Karen Mok's characters. I would have wanted to see the sparks fly ;) But the more I think about it, the more I realize that by not including that element, the team made the right artistic decision which served the story, not the sheer entertainment factor.

She has to leave her son Slimane (Slimane Khettabi) to Yann. Things get even worse when Nadia disappears without a trace.[1] Yann has to sell the building at a low price, not enough to pay all his debts, and has to move with Slimane from his nearby caravan to an unattractive room, which he rents from the buyer. He robs the man and travels with Slimane to Canada. He finds Nadia, she is in custody. He comes to the prison but at first she refuses to accept the visit. The next day she allows him to visit her but to Slimane's regret she refuses to see him, out of shame. She is there for drug possession, but she is innocent.

So chances were quite good that the production qualities would be somewhat uncertain, even being based on Patricia Highsmith's novel, the same author of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" (1999), amazingly adapted by Anthony Minghella and one of the finest movies of his career.\n\nAfter Minghella's adaptation, which was praised by everyone for its outstanding visual and technical qualities, and his skills to develop the story as a captivating and progressive dramatic thriller, also including a character that does not exist in the book that instead of negatively change the course of the story only increased the hitchcockian tone he gave to the plot, Hollywood didn't produced anything like that since then. \n\nWhen people watch the trailer of "The Two Faces of January" some honorable resemblances to Minghella's adaptation of Highsmith's Ripley will pop, and strong comparisons will be inevitable. That's what I felt, so my expectations were high. The attempts to repeat the same successful formula were so evident that one of the executive producers is Max Minghella, son of the late director. \n\nReally, the comparisons cannot be avoided, but rather to become nostalgic references or even an excellent opportunity to honor Minghella and his merits achieved by one of his greatest works, "Two Faces Of January" becomes a very frustrating experience in many aspects. \n\nThe condensed narrative, the thrilling moments involving the unknown past of each one of the characters and some key events that occur within the first half hour conducted by Alberto Iglesias music (with great references to Bernard Herrmann's in Psycho) clearly lead and prepare the viewer to a thrilling expected atmosphere. But unfortunately the robustness presented loses strength when the story achieves a shallow plateau that forgets to explore the past of each one of the characters as well as never taking truly advantage of their personal psychological conflicts as happen in the book, especially Rydal, the main character.\n\nThe title is a reference to Janus, a roman god with two faces, guardian of the transitions, doors, decisions and the beginning. One face looks to the past and the other to the future. This mythical figure represents the reckoning that Rydal is about to face and the dangerous decisions he will have to take. Also, the story take place in early January, which also means a new beginning in popular culture. In the book Highsmith makes clear those associations with the title when Rydal feels a strange and painful resemblance between Chester and his late father, and between Colette and a girl he was madly in love when a teenager. The transference he makes of these two strong figures of his life to Chester and Colette is what leads Rydal keeps himself close to them in the unconscious quest to solve his traumatic relationship with his hateful father and also try to continue an interrupted love interest he had in the past. \n\nBut in the movie, none of this fundamental matters are explored the way it should. There are only brief moments that loosely make clear Chester's resemblances to Rydal's late father but no major developments about that is given to clarify the reasons why the love-hate relationship grows so strong between them. Hossein makes it feels like all the love-hate relationship is because they share the same love interest: Colette. On the contrary of the psychological thriller that the book is, the movie makes it all a common passion crime flick, with silly police chasings, love triangle in the simplest possible way exploiting a naive Colette that does not exist, since the book makes reference to her recurring infidelity. The result is an empty movie with a trite ending that makes entire plot feels redundant rather than being Rydal's final journey in search for absolution over his most inner conflicts.\n\nEven developing an excellent job, Viggo Mortensen has his talent wasted here because of the forgettable film that it strikingly is. Kirsten Dunst seems to not yet have learned how to be sophisticated without always look like a college student, and as always, her best moments are when her character is under pressure. Wasted are also the locations in Greece and Turkey instead of doing the same thing Minghella did when making all the exuberance within the Italian landscapes an extra mix of beauty and soft cruelty in "The Talented Mr. Ripley". Oscar Isaac has impressive moments, perhaps because he did know the original work and also that his character is much more complex than the script provided, but for the viewer that is poorly cleared thru the 96 minutes, the attitudes of his character will feel just like an empty and romantically misplaced fixation without any coherent foundation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30560,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Romance","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-05-16","keywords":"greece,ruins,athens greece,american in europe,foot chase","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2448730905","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MDQ0NTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk1MjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MDQ0NTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk1MjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"1962, Athens: Rydal, a young man acting as a tour guide while scamming visitors on the side gets entangled in the lives of Chester and Colette MacFarland, a seemingly glamorous American couple.

This is a hard movie to review, mainly because the plot was a little hard to follow, for me at least. It was really just a movie about a type of espionage triangle and you begin to question everyone's motives. It was pretty slow moving and went back and forth between french and English so if you aren't a big foreign movie fan that is your warning. This is a movie for a select group of people. For me it was a little too slow and predictable for me to fully get into. Overall, nothing that I would rush and see or see again. I give this a C+.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5421,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-02-27","keywords":"oligarch,espionage,heliport,yacht,newspaper","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi330671641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkyNjA1NDA1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkzOTkxOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzkyNjA1NDA1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjkzOTkxOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Monaco, an FSB officer falls in love with his agent while they track a powerful Russian oligarch.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0241121/","name":"Jean Dujardin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0208426/","name":"Cécile de France","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0733886/","name":"Eric Rochant"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139955/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175774/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044413/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0733886/","name":"Eric Rochant"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First off, I have never seen an Alexander Payne film, and the story itself sort of seemed like the type of film that would end up on a long list of solid films that end up being unmemorable. Much to my surprise, it has a sort of tone that you don't see often in these types of films.\n\nThis is a film that carefully treads around the edges. I wouldn't say it ever became too sentimental. Yet I also expected a snappy dialogue- filled, fast-paced dramedy, sort of like Reitman's Up in the Air, that other Clooney film. The film is written and plays out like a real life situation. One could maybe try to say that about any film like this, but here it rings true. To say it's slow or fast paced isn't really what matters, but what matters is how much it develops its characters with real richness and detail. In a way, the screenplay is helped a lot by Payne as a director, not because the writing is thin, but because the direction allows the film to feel sort of spontaneous. This isn't a film full of twists or turns, and yet at every corner when you try to analyze it, you realize how unpredictable it all feels. \n\nI have also heard one thing about it in many reviews, and that is how it's messy like life. One can easily read those descriptions and just roll his or her eyes, but that description really holds truth. The film doesn't feel to glamorous or stylized. It certainly isn't the dramedy with witty one liners that I expected. Instead, when it's all over, you take a step back and realize that it all feels sort of messy. It's not complicated, and in fact it's a pretty simple film, but even the editing helps this certain mood that the film leaves you in. It's simple, yet hard to really pinpoint and describe how it all comes together or how it's something of real importance. This is completely refreshing, especially when films these days hammer you with these sort of messages or details.\n\nI now want to talk about the performances, which are stellar. Clooney just won the Globe a couple of hours ago, and now I look at it and think to myself "wow... of all of his performances, this is getting him awards?". It's a very restrained performance, and no, it isn't a transformation. Some will once again say that Clooney is only "playing himself", but to me, when Clooney does great, he really nails it. He gives all of his performances something distinct about them, and this is perhaps his wild-card character. He doesn't add in his usual smoothness that we see a lot from him. This stands apart, and I am surprised for that reason for its success. Shailene Woodley is fantastic here as well, and really impressed me with the sort of indignation and maturity that she mixes together. She's better than most of the contenders for the Oscar in her category, more specifically Octavia Spencer, Melissa McCarthy, and Janet McTeer.\n\nI loved this film. I wasn't sure of it while I was seeing it, but after it's over, as hard as it is to really describe and know why I enjoyed it so much, I did.

Every once in a while, particularly during summer months when studios are rolling out their blockbuster hopefuls, you'll see a couple of movies released that seem to be mirror images of one-another. Not exactly the same, but similar enough that it seems like they must have some common ancestor.\n\nThe reason why this happens is pretty straight forward and has to do with the unusual way the movie industry works. Often, the scripts for movies aren't developed in-house by the studios, but rather purchased from freelance writers who come up with an idea and then "pitch" it to multiple studios looking for a buyer.\n\nThe process works for both the writers and the studios. There is a catch, however, which is that the person pitching relies upon a studio honoring an informal agreement not to use an idea without compensating the creator. The problem is that less scrupulous studio executives will have no problem passing on an idea and then blatantly copying it for their own movie. And even though everyone involved knows what's happening, it's pretty rare for anyone to actually sue over it, so it tends to keep happening.\n\nA famous example of this (famous in the relative sense) happened with the movies 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. The original author who pitched 'Deep Impact' watched a studio exec take copious notes during the pitch, pass on it, and then rush to create a script and get his ripped off version made in time to compete with 'Deep Impact', which was purchased by another studio.\n\nThis usually happens when someone creates a script that captures the zeitgeist; that taps into an idea that just clicks with what people are talking and thinking about and it becomes the "must have" idea of the year.\n\nUnless you're an industry insider, it can be difficult to know which movie was the original concept and which was the ripoff, but generally the original idea will be more polished and well thought out. 'Armageddon', for example, famously had such huge plot holes that the cast was complaining about them during filming.\n\n'Olympus Has Fallen' (OHF) came out around the same time as 'White House Down' (WHD). Both movies feature an attack on the white house with an invading force, aided by a turncoat secret service agent, conquering the presidential security in an attempt to take him hostage. Both movies also have a protagonist who isn't secret service, but has some connection to the agency and ultimately proves that he deserves to be guarding the president. Both movies involve protecting a child caught in the crossfire. Both have failed attempts by special forces to re-take the building. Both involve explosions that destroy the building. Both movies involve forcing a change to foreign policy. And so on, you get the idea.\n\nI don't know which was the original, but I have a guess. The movies were made during the presidency of Barack Obama. After he was elected, there was a lot of speculation about whether he would be the subject of an assassination attempt. To African Americans Obama represented an almost unbelievable event: one of their own elected to the most powerful office in the nation. And there was a great deal of angst about losing him violently, the way a number of prominent black leaders had been lost in the past. I think that was the kernel that sparked the original screenplay; this clash of the old power base and the new one in the symbolic seat of national power.\n\nTo my mind, WHD was the liberal take on the idea while OHF was the conservative counter. WHD featured a charismatic black president clearly modeled after Obama, right down to his attempts to quit smoking. The villains are white supremacist types backed by the old-guard military industrial complex who are fearful of the changes the president was making to foreign policy. And the protagonist is a millennial trying to prove he was worthy of the responsibility of protecting the president, perhaps an analogy for the young political activists that brought new methods of campaigning to Obama's election.\n\nOHF, by contrast, features a white male president with villains who were almost exclusively Asian, and rather than representing the supporters of the status quo they are actively looking to tear down American force abroad, suggesting that the bad guys can't stand how effective the traditional American foreign policy is. In other words, the message is "we are winning and they are getting desperate". Even the protagonist is more representative of the target audience: a middle-aged man with a penchant for defiantly vowing to destroy the villains and defend our way of life.\n\nNeither movie is particularly deep; it's mostly about the action sequences. In other words, these are popcorn movies. But I do think it's interesting how two such similar base ideas can manifest such different messages. While WHD is about the (then) rising tide of the progressive political movement and the supposed fear within groups that traditionally held power in the US, OHF is all about the traditional conservative message of Jingoism and the need to protect ourselves from the parts of the world that don't share our values.\n\nWhatever the case may be, OHF was successful enough to green light a second film 'London Has Fallen', which is a continuation of the themes, only with (primarily) middle-eastern villains instead of Asian ones, and an upcoming 'Angel Has Fallen'. Personally, I thought OHF was decent but unspectacular. I enjoyed it enough when I saw it on HBO or Netflix or wherever, but I probably wouldn't pay to see it in the theater.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"politics,political thriller,u.s. president,political assassination,white house","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exclusive Debut","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3461588761","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning finds himself trapped inside the White House in the wake of a terrorist attack; using his inside knowledge, Banning works with national security to rescue the President from his kidnappers."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001173/","name":"Aaron Eckhart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332840/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4950667/","name":"Creighton Rothenberger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4951717/","name":"Katrin Benedikt"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Since the 60's, the french directors have always been fascinating by American cinema. But most of them use the American cinema's codes to transpose them in a french environment : from Truffaut' "Tirez Sur Le Pianiste" - which plays with the stereotypes of the Film noir in a french universe - to Gans' "Pacte Des loups" - which transposes the western codes in the pre-revolutionary France.\n\nAnd it seems that, with "Quatre étoiles", Christian Vincent tries to archive this form of transformation of American's codes with the french touch. Indeed, the director quotes himself American's comedies from the 40's and says they're direct influence to make this film. "Quatre étoiles" tries to transfers the atmosphere of American's classical comedies from Los Angeles to Cannes. But unfortunately, it doesn't work. Why ? \n\nLike in a Cukor' or Lubitch' comedy, the character - a young an inconstant woman - inherit, out of nowhere, 50000 euros and decides to spend it all in a week in Cannes, where, in search of adventures, she falls in love with a small time crook, played by José Garcia. And if a lot of situations are similar to 40's and 50's American films, it never reaches their level of grace and humor. It's true that we have, like in American movies, a young and in-experimented girl who knows exactly what she wants, and who decides to change her life and social position in a day, and that we also have an impossible love story between two characters who hate each other, and are still stuck together, but everything seems so small compared to its models.\n\nWhen, in a American movie, the character would have inherit millions of dollars, the character here has only a few euros left, which can't provokes great and hilarious contrasted situations. The movie always avoid absurd situations and epic quiproquos, like it is afraid of its comical potential : everything stays calm and little, like the characters, who are just a reduction of American stereotypes : like the talkative-but-not-so-bad-crook. And when you reduce stereotypes, nothing much stays.\n\nWhat stays after this very little movie is a small impression of boring, just tempered by the presence of the great Francois Cluzet, who plays a very funny half-brained ex-formula 1 driver, who falls in love with the wrong girl.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1269,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-05-03","keywords":"riviera,bath,topless female nudity,female nudity,paris france","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2180234265","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M2YTI4ZDctYzk0MS00NDA3LTk0YjQtODdiNTE5OWI1NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2M2YTI4ZDctYzk0MS00NDA3LTk0YjQtODdiNTE5OWI1NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305296/","name":"José Garcia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494161/","name":"Renée Le Calm"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0141140/","name":"Isabelle Carré"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898603/","name":"Christian Vincent"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037192/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206797/","name":"Olivier Dazat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898603/","name":"Christian Vincent"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

All in all, this is truly a perfectly crafted film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":543599,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-02-27","keywords":"oil,misanthrope,loss of hearing,1910s,prospector","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"There Will Be Blood","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1341980953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRhOWY5N2EtYzk0NS00ZTFlLTk4MTktMzdhYWM5OGFmMDM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRhOWY5N2EtYzk0NS00ZTFlLTk4MTktMzdhYWM5OGFmMDM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Miramax","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000358/","name":"Daniel Day-Lewis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001354/","name":"Ciarán Hinds"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000759/","name":"Paul Thomas Anderson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027686/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000759/","name":"Paul Thomas Anderson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0801737/","name":"Upton Sinclair"],"duration":"PT2H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The cast are admirable in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day Lewis, and Cameron Diaz. DiCaprio is great as Amsterdam Vallon a man seeking revenge against the one who killed his father. DiCaprio may not have the flashier role like Day Lewis but he's still believable as the hero bringing that intensity he's been know for to the character. Daniel Day Lewis gives a knock out performance as Billy "The Butcher" Cutting a psychotic gangland kingpin who killed Amsterdams father. Day Lewis is terrific in the role of a man whose willing to kill anyone without hesitation. The people are either with him or against him there is no middle ground. Cameron Diaz is good as Jenny Everdeane a woman willing to do almost anything to survive and a potential love interest for DiCaprio's Amsterdam. John C Reilly, Jim Broadbent, Bredan Gleason, Henry Thomas, and a brief appearance by Liam Neeson are effective as the supporting characters but most of them don't have much to do and aren't in it much either. All of them still turn in solid performances none the less in their limited screen time. Most of the movie takes place in New York during 1863 when one of the worst riots in American history took place. The fact that this really did happen gave the movie a realistic fool especially the location where they chose to have this film take place giving audiences a look at what it could've been like back then in New York. The action sequences which mostly involve people getting beat up in brutal ways are well executed especially the riots at the end. The showdown between Amsertdam and Bill was a bit of a letdown but it was fitting for the movie. The film was a bit long with a running time of 167 minutes. The pacing was a little slow at times but the performances by the cast make it worth watching anyway. Despite some flaws Gangs Of New York is still a well made crime drama with enough action, some suspense, a little humor and romance. So if you can get past the long running time Gangs Of New York is definitely worth watching and most of that besides what I already mentioned is because of the exceptional performances (especially Day Lewis and DiCaprio) by the lead actors and the amazing talent of Scorcese who continues to prove himself as a gifted filmmaker with this movie.

A master of complex story telling his novels are often composed of characters standing around discussing complicated geo-political situations and the human condition . This means that his novels are fundamentally uncinematic , a fact reflected that so little of his work has been adapted to the silver screen . With this adaptation of his 1974 novel I doubt if anyone was expecting a James Bond thriller and I know I wasn't but even so you're struck as to how a Le Carre thriller doesn't lend itself to mainstream cinema \n\nYou can't fault the film for its production values . It contains a who's who of prestigious big hitting British character actors such as Oldman , Hurt and Firth alongside up and coming peers such as Hardy and Cumberbatch . We also get a host of under rated actors in Strong and Burke and at a casting level none of this can be faulted . The look of the film is fantastic with the brownish dull hues reflecting both Communist Eastern Europe and run down Britain in the early 1970s and a day after seeing the movie my abiding memory of the film is the cinematography \n\nThe problem is that - and I'm afraid to admit this - is that I didn't have a clue what was going on most of the time .

This film topped the film charts in Britain for a grand total of three weeks and one suspects by way of a backhanded compliment many people went to the cinema for a second and third time in order to unravel the plot .

That said, thirty years before "Nos Jours Heureux", Claude Millers' debut film "La Meilleure Façon De Marcher" (1976) used this type of place as a backdrop to depict an ambiguous relationship between two counselors who were admirably portrayed by Patrick Deweare and Patrick Bouchitey. And at a pinch, one could also quote Gérard Jugnot's "Scout Toujours..." (1985).\n\nBut here, it's a true children's holiday camp that is depicted here. Set in 1992, a manager Vincent (Jean Paul Rouve) has to run a children's holiday camp for three weeks and to face the unexpected concerning the place, his colleagues, various problems linked to children about the rooms, trips, their belongings. Very often, what seem at first little problems end up becoming great ones which can sometimes be solved in a curious and humorist way.\n\nBecause it's the tone used by the two directors to relate these crazy three weeks. I must admit it's a shame they have recourse to clichés to depict several types of counselors between shy Caroline, seducing Lisa who doesn't leave Vincent indifferent, big mouth Daniel. OK, these stereotypes are the motors to several comical sequences but I would have liked more originality. The same goes for the kids between the witty one, the anguished one who keeps on asking a thousand questions about all and nothing. And of course, girls are one of their biggest interests during their holidays.\n\nThat said, the energy of the actors, the nostalgic look adopted by the directors, the funny ways big problems are solved or circumvented are enough to honestly have fun and to spend a really good time in front of this vibrant comedy although it is cluttered with clichés. But as they're not too overwhelming, one can forget them without any remorse. One will also forget a too cozy end.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3625,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"young love,summer vacation,summer camp,train,summer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4043619865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0OTA3N2QtZTcwMi00NjliLTgzM2ItNzFlNTg1MTkxNDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0OTA3N2QtZTcwMi00NjliLTgzM2ItNzFlNTg1MTkxNDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0077622/","name":"Marilou Berry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1082477/","name":"Omar Sy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619923/","name":"Olivier Nakache"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865918/","name":"Éric Toledano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098808/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069340/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006560/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619923/","name":"Olivier Nakache"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865918/","name":"Éric Toledano"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

From romance to friendship, dancing to fighting, this French movie bring back good souvenirs of childhood.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0478566/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"dbdumonteil","dateCreated":"2009-08-13","inLanguage":"English","name":"The Best Way To Walk","reviewBody":"Leisure centers for children haven't been often at the core of films in French cinema. That said, thirty years before "Nos Jours Heureux", Claude Millers' debut film "La Meilleure Façon De Marcher" (1976) used this type of place as a backdrop to depict an ambiguous relationship between two counselors who were admirably portrayed by Patrick Deweare and Patrick Bouchitey. And at a pinch, one could also quote Gérard Jugnot's "Scout Toujours..." (1985).\n\nBut here, it's a true children's holiday camp that is depicted here. Set in 1992, a manager Vincent (Jean Paul Rouve) has to run a children's holiday camp for three weeks and to face the unexpected concerning the place, his colleagues, various problems linked to children about the rooms, trips, their belongings. Very often, what seem at first little problems end up becoming great ones which can sometimes be solved in a curious and humorist way.\n\nBecause it's the tone used by the two directors to relate these crazy three weeks. I must admit it's a shame they have recourse to clichés to depict several types of counselors between shy Caroline, seducing Lisa who doesn't leave Vincent indifferent, big mouth Daniel. OK, these stereotypes are the motors to several comical sequences but I would have liked more originality. The same goes for the kids between the witty one, the anguished one who keeps on asking a thousand questions about all and nothing. And of course, girls are one of their biggest interests during their holidays.\n\nThat said, the energy of the actors, the nostalgic look adopted by the directors, the funny ways big problems are solved or circumvented are enough to honestly have fun and to spend a really good time in front of this vibrant comedy although it is cluttered with clichés. But as they're not too overwhelming, one can forget them without any remorse. One will also forget a too cozy end.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3625,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"young love,summer vacation,summer camp,train,summer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4043619865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0OTA3N2QtZTcwMi00NjliLTgzM2ItNzFlNTg1MTkxNDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0OTA3N2QtZTcwMi00NjliLTgzM2ItNzFlNTg1MTkxNDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0077622/","name":"Marilou Berry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1082477/","name":"Omar Sy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619923/","name":"Olivier Nakache","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865918/","name":"Éric Toledano"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098808/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069340/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006560/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619923/","name":"Olivier Nakache","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865918/","name":"Éric Toledano"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In DELICATESSEN, there were of course the weirdness and odd sets, but the story and acting was so much more important and this made me care much more for the characters.

His delivery and manner is just captivating.\n\nNow usually in most of my reviews I give a summary of the plot. Here it's very tough because I still am not 100% sure what I saw!! It all involves an evil genius who was created by one of the Dominique Pinons. This guy spends much of the movie kidnapping kids and trying to steal their dreams (kind of like an evil twist on MONSTERS INC.). At the same time, some evil freaks led by conjoined twins are thrown in as rival baddies. In the midst of this, Ron Perlman (who speaks no French in real life) and a little girl set off in search of Perlman's stolen little brother. There's more to it than that, but really I didn't think the story was that important--it was more a chance to give a canvas to all the weird sets and characters.\n\nOverall, I liked seeing the film but I never came close to loving it.

Antoine is a social wannabe who drops an elusive aristocrat's name to get into an exclusive party. The name - Jordan - gets him whisked by two burly bodyguards into the office of the host, von Bulow, who won't accept Antoine's admission of lying, gives him $100,000, and promises $900,000 more when led to Jordan. Enticed by the money, Antoine, with the help of his friend Étienne, begins his search. He follows trails through Paris's night scene, gets beaten up and bitten, and meets Jordan's sister, Violaine.

Their efforts were crowned in 1991, when they were finally able to take their craft to a full feature length film, in the project that would become their breakthrough in the film industry and the proper beginning of their careers as filmmakers: the post-apocalyptic comedy "Delicatessen".\n\nThe world of "Delicatessen" is a dark bleak France where there is apparently no law and food is incredibly sparse (and is now used as currency). In this post-apocalyptic world, the residents of an apartment building in the middle of nowhere have found a solution to the hunger thanks to their landlord, the butcher Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus), who from time to time kills the building's handyman to feed the bizarre group of tenants. One day, former clown Louison (Dominique Pinon) arrives to the building and gets the handyman position, but unfortunately for Clapet and the other tenants, the butcher's daughter Julie (Marie-Laure Dougnac) has fallen in love with Louison, and will do whatever is necessary to stop the madness of the delicatessen.\n\nWritten by Gilles Adrien (who also wrote many of the previous Jeunet &amp; Caro shorts) as well as Jeunet &amp; Caro themselves, "Delicatessen" is a wonderfully imaginative tale of sweet romance and hilarious black comedy that gives an unexpected light-hearted twist to a plot that most writers would treat as a serious subject matter. And surprisingly it works, as while the story is anything but complex, the assortment of strange (yet very human) characters that populate the world of "Delicatessen" truly become the movie's soul. And not only the main characters, as every single one of them (no matter how small the role is) is highly detailed and serves a specific function as if the whole building was one of the odd machines that still work in this post-apocalyptic portrait of France.\n\nVisually, the film is simply sublime. Since the directors decided to divide responsibilities, Marc Caro took full control of the production design and the artistic elements of the movie, so with this freedom Caro's inventive artistic vision reaches new heights creating a movie that could be described as a moving canvas. Highly atmospheric, the french duo takes the cinematography (by Darius Khondji) to the next level mixing techniques and showing a whole range of influences that go from German Expressionism to 40s modernism, resulting in one of the most beautiful looking movies ever done. Still, the movie is more than a visual fest, as Jeunet (in charge of guiding the actors) shows a complete domain over his cast &amp; crew keeping the many elements of the film working nicely in the right place.\n\nAs written above, the characters are the film's soul, and the ensemble of actors playing them really made a terrific job in the film. Dominique Pinon (who would become one of Jeunet's regular collaborators) delivers a subtle and charming performance as the ex-clown Louison. He is very believable in the role, and gives the character a very human touch, essential for the kind of character he is playing. The same can be said of Marie-Laure Dougnac, who plays Louison's love interest, Julie, one of the "more normal" characters in the movie. Jean-Claude Dreyfus as Clapet the Butcher is simply delightful as the story's "villian", and basically every member of the cast delivers an unforgettable performance no matter how long or short is their screen time (Silvie Laguna for example, is really wonderful).\n\n"Delicatessen" is a solid debut by this two skillful french artists, and it already shows why the two quickly became an important team in the French fantasy cinema. Their very own brand of surrealist fantasy flows freely through the film making a unique visual fest (although it definitely goes a bit over-the-top at times), and while it doesn't reach the artistic level of their follow-up (the 1995 classic "La Cité Des Enfants Perdus"), it's still a nicely done movie that most importantly, never gets boring or tiresome. Unlike their later films, "Delicatessen" may not be for everyone, as it's mix of black comedy and surreal fantasy may seem at times too close to absurd to be enjoyable. However, those with a taste for the bizarre will find a great movie in this French comedy.\n\nWhile "Delicatessen" still shows the excess of the young and raw talent of Jeunet &amp; Caro, it's not hard to see why they became known worldwide after this initial success, as this movie shows the enormous potential of their skills as filmmakers. This brilliant mixture of genres is definitely a very recommended movie, and like "La Cité Des Enfants Perdus" ("City of the Lost Children"), an essential film of the 90s. 8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1991-04-17","keywords":"surrealist,black comedy,human meat,absurd comedy,bed","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Delicatessen: 25th Anniversary","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3100882457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5ODA2ZDQtNjU4OC00OWQxLWExNTQtZmY1YjhjZThmZDI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5ODA2ZDQtNjU4OC00OWQxLWExNTQtZmY1YjhjZThmZDI4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Delicatessen: 25th Anniversary"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235342/","name":"Marie-Laure Dougnac"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684500/","name":"Dominique Pinon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070991/","name":"Pascal Benezech"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065791/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012496/","name":"Gilles Adrien"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A fascinating intro, we are as enlivened as the TV audience as the story begins.  The sad truth of the attractiveness of live television shows shines through as guests are humiliated through the words of others, a premise that is expanded on throughout the rest of the movie.\n\n\tWhat we gather in rapid fashion is that the assistant (Bastien, played by director Guillaume Canet) cheering on the audience is an ambitious sort that wants to develop his own show after the styling of his chosen mentor, `It's Tissue Times' producer (Broustal, as played by François Berléand) .  There are complexities involving other characters right from the beginning, including the presence of Broustal's wife, the unhappy and reluctant companionship of Bastien's girlfriend Fabienne (Clotilde Courau) and the egotistically insufferable `It's Tissue Time' host Philippe Letzger (Philippe Lefebvre).\n\n\tA concept Bastien has developed for his own show is presented by Philippe and Bastien to the producer, and after being invited to a party at a disco Bastien is further asked to accompany Broustal and his much younger wife Clara (Diane Kruger, recently seen in `Troy') to their country home for the weekend.  Bastien's ambition overwhelms any trepidation (he dismisses Fabienne's objections; this is his big chance!) he may have about the opportunity.  The idiosyncrasies of the couple are unsettling to him and to us as well, portending a less productive and perhaps more involved weekend then Broustal has mentioned (working on the TV project).\n\n\tSo things begin to happen even on the ride from the disco to the country estate of Broustal.  The real reason for the invitation is slow in coming, but is no real surprise as events unfold.  But the proceedings are as strange as the setting for them; why does Broustal have an enormous cage with vultures, how normal is it for that man's wife to be so interested in Bastien, and why is one surprise after another perhaps normal in the affairs of Broustal and Clara?\n\n\tWhat is great about this film and what sets it apart from mainstream movies is the relentless nature of Broustal.  François Berléand gives a performance not unlike that of Ben Kingsley in "Sexy Beast" a few years back.  Here is a character with enormous personal presence, generally unlikable but with reserves of condescension and cynicism the likes of which can only be transmitted through a strong performance.  \n\n\tThis is a good film with grit-your-teeth moments, comic touches and the general cachet of "Sexy Beast".  The Seventies feel is perhaps due to the Continental locale and décor of a manor appointed to the taste of an avant-garde couple.  But what plays out at the estate is at times violent, always sexually tense, never touching and at all times unpredictable.  This film is not for one with mainstream tastes and children need not view it until well into their thirties.  Even the ending is a surprise, and a pretty tidy tie-up at that.\n\n\tRating: 3.5 Stars."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1623,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-17","keywords":"television,urination,shower,older man younger woman relationship,kitchen","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2187968025","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2VlOGE0ODEtMDBhNC00ZTJkLWFkNjktNTgyNzc1ZTcxYWI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2VlOGE0ODEtMDBhNC00ZTJkLWFkNjktNTgyNzc1ZTcxYWI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075710/","name":"François Berléand"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0133899/","name":"Guillaume Canet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1208167/","name":"Diane Kruger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0133899/","name":"Guillaume Canet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069340/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0077007/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085679/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0133899/","name":"Guillaume Canet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1162222/","name":"Philippe Lefebvre"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1051119/","name":"Éric Naggar"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A fascinating intro, we are as enlivened as the TV audience as the story begins.  The sad truth of the attractiveness of live television shows shines through as guests are humiliated through the words of others, a premise that is expanded on throughout the rest of the movie.\n\n\tWhat we gather in rapid fashion is that the assistant (Bastien, played by director Guillaume Canet) cheering on the audience is an ambitious sort that wants to develop his own show after the styling of his chosen mentor, `It's Tissue Times' producer (Broustal, as played by François Berléand) .  There are complexities involving other characters right from the beginning, including the presence of Broustal's wife, the unhappy and reluctant companionship of Bastien's girlfriend Fabienne (Clotilde Courau) and the egotistically insufferable `It's Tissue Time' host Philippe Letzger (Philippe Lefebvre).\n\n\tA concept Bastien has developed for his own show is presented by Philippe and Bastien to the producer, and after being invited to a party at a disco Bastien is further asked to accompany Broustal and his much younger wife Clara (Diane Kruger, recently seen in `Troy') to their country home for the weekend.  Bastien's ambition overwhelms any trepidation (he dismisses Fabienne's objections; this is his big chance!) he may have about the opportunity.  The idiosyncrasies of the couple are unsettling to him and to us as well, portending a less productive and perhaps more involved weekend then Broustal has mentioned (working on the TV project).\n\n\tSo things begin to happen even on the ride from the disco to the country estate of Broustal.  The real reason for the invitation is slow in coming, but is no real surprise as events unfold.  But the proceedings are as strange as the setting for them; why does Broustal have an enormous cage with vultures, how normal is it for that man's wife to be so interested in Bastien, and why is one surprise after another perhaps normal in the affairs of Broustal and Clara?\n\n\tWhat is great about this film and what sets it apart from mainstream movies is the relentless nature of Broustal.  François Berléand gives a performance not unlike that of Ben Kingsley in "Sexy Beast" a few years back.  Here is a character with enormous personal presence, generally unlikable but with reserves of condescension and cynicism the likes of which can only be transmitted through a strong performance.  \n\n\tThis is a good film with grit-your-teeth moments, comic touches and the general cachet of "Sexy Beast".  The Seventies feel is perhaps due to the Continental locale and décor of a manor appointed to the taste of an avant-garde couple.  But what plays out at the estate is at times violent, always sexually tense, never touching and at all times unpredictable.  This film is not for one with mainstream tastes and children need not view it until well into their thirties.  Even the ending is a surprise, and a pretty tidy tie-up at that.\n\n\tRating: 3.5 Stars.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1623,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-17","keywords":"television,urination,shower,older man younger woman relationship,kitchen","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2187968025","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2VlOGE0ODEtMDBhNC00ZTJkLWFkNjktNTgyNzc1ZTcxYWI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2VlOGE0ODEtMDBhNC00ZTJkLWFkNjktNTgyNzc1ZTcxYWI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075710/","name":"François Berléand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0133899/","name":"Guillaume Canet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1208167/","name":"Diane Kruger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0133899/","name":"Guillaume Canet"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069340/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0077007/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085679/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0133899/","name":"Guillaume Canet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1162222/","name":"Philippe Lefebvre","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1051119/","name":"Éric Naggar"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Jonze is famous for this, and how he can connect it to the folds in the narrative.\n\n"Folds" in this context have to do with nesting of narrative elements. For instance the "real world" segments feature eating (twice), fort (twice), snowball fight, wild suit, pileon, pulling at toes, lost marriage, broken model of a heart, being king, son/sun dying and so on. The "wild world" features the same things twisted in ways that suggest the real narrative describing the inner character of Max. This "folding" gives us a place to stand and engages us more deeply, as a key narrative device. There is even a smaller inner fold where Carol (the Max surrogate) makes a model of his world, hidden in the desert. And another where Max enters KW.\n\nI am more interested in the spatial folding. Yup, the way that Jonze has decided to set up and elaborate a vocabulary of movement.\n\nHere's what we have, I think. I have only seen this once and will have to wait for DVD study to confirm it.\n\nThe scenes I am working with here are the ones with physical motion, where both the camera and the subjects move: the dogchasing, snowball fight, the amazing encounter with the waves when approaching the island, the rumpus and then the dirtball fight. Frozen motionpaths are in the fort's appendage, the "pile," and indicated by the stickweaving in the global fort and houses.\n\nI believe these all use the same motion template. When someone invents a movie annotation tool where we can find and describe this, it will be easy to check and show. Right now it is an impression, but I got the feeling when watching that wave scene (in IMAX) that I would see the same motion paths in the forthcoming rumpus. Perhaps it was the appearance of the ululating sound that was used every time something got frantic, and by that time twice already. Perhaps it was the obvious reference to the Hokusai woodblock ("The Great Wave off Kanagawa"), where a wild wave becomes an actor, a wild thing dwarfing an iconic mountain, whose shape I thought I also saw on-screen.\n\nI would not be surprised either if Spike used a sigla to denote this motion (like Joyce does in "Finnegans Wake") and that the sigla was KW, denoting the actual paths, the K in plan and the W in the vertical plane. Thus, KW swallowing/eating Max, apart from the obvious vaginal association also takes on a deeply cinematic one, worthy of "Adaptation." I know the work on this was done in Melbourne. Could it be that this apparent one-man shop "Digital Rein" managed this? In an unconnected area, am I misremembering? I recall the phrase was "Let the Wild Rumpus Begin!" (not "start").\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":102760,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2009-10-16","keywords":"based on children's book,creature,imagination,fantasy world,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Where the Wild Things Are -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3225158169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTY0NjAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2NjYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTY0NjAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2NjYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The second theatrical trailer for Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are, an adaptation of Maurice Sendak's children's book.

When someone invents a movie annotation tool where we can find and describe this, it will be easy to check and show. Right now it is an impression, but I got the feeling when watching that wave scene (in IMAX) that I would see the same motion paths in the forthcoming rumpus. Perhaps it was the appearance of the ululating sound that was used every time something got frantic, and by that time twice already. Perhaps it was the obvious reference to the Hokusai woodblock ("The Great Wave off Kanagawa"), where a wild wave becomes an actor, a wild thing dwarfing an iconic mountain, whose shape I thought I also saw on-screen.\n\nI would not be surprised either if Spike used a sigla to denote this motion (like Joyce does in "Finnegans Wake") and that the sigla was KW, denoting the actual paths, the K in plan and the W in the vertical plane. Thus, KW swallowing/eating Max, apart from the obvious vaginal association also takes on a deeply cinematic one, worthy of "Adaptation." I know the work on this was done in Melbourne. Could it be that this apparent one-man shop "Digital Rein" managed this? In an unconnected area, am I misremembering? I recall the phrase was "Let the Wild Rumpus Begin!" (not "start").\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":102760,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2009-10-16","keywords":"based on children's book,creature,imagination,fantasy world,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Where the Wild Things Are -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3225158169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTY0NjAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2NjYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTY0NjAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2NjYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The second theatrical trailer for Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are, an adaptation of Maurice Sendak's children's book.

With a stunning central performance by Gary Oldman, confident and passionate directing from Joe Wright, and a brilliant screenplay from start to finish, Darkest Hour is a simply exceptional film.\n\nWhen telling a story as well-known as that of Winston Churchill and the Second World War, being both exciting and historically accurate isn't always easy, but that's where the unique take on the historical drama of Darkest Hour comes in.\n\nYes, it does tell of the extreme intensity of the early days of the war, the political manoeuvring in Westminster as Churchill was appointed Prime Minister, and the very real and impending threat that the fall of Britain could very well mean the end of freedom-loving Western civilisation, which are all absolutely fascinating to watch unfold, but they're all parts of history that you arguably already know very well.\n\nThat's why the film's decision to bring a brilliant sense of humour and a strong passion to proceedings is so effective. The importance of the events being portrayed on screen is never downplayed, and there are indeed some very intense and emotionally powerful moments, but there's so much more to Darkest Hour than just history, something that made it such a refreshing watch compared to how most Oscar-bait biographies turn out.\n\nAbove all, what impressed me most about the film was the fact that it's just so funny. It's by no means a comedy, but this isn't a pompous and dry historical drama, but one that takes glee in pointing out the eccentricities in its main character, eccentricities which are undoubtedly a part of why Churchill is so lauded and respected to this day.\n\nWhile the film praises Churchill's bulldog spirit in fighting the fight against the Nazis, it's always keen to show him in a slightly brighter light, almost as if he was a man who stumbled into the most important job in history by coincidence. In that, there are so many genuinely hilarious scenes as Churchill's quirky personality clashes with the more uptight politicians of Westminster, a part of the film that I felt not only made everything more entertaining, but helped to give the movie an incredibly refreshing energy, allowing me to see Churchill in a very relatable, personal light rather than just as a historical figure from a textbook.\n\nAs well as being downright hilarious at points, there's a real passion behind the film's depiction of the darkest hours of the war. With Churchill being forced over to opening peace talks with Hitler, the film does an incredible job at inspiring you to a point of fever pitch, fully backing Churchill's bulldog spirit to fight and defend freedom to the very last moment, meaning that the internal conflict he suffers throughout the film is such a riveting focal point.\n\nThis is an undoubtedly patriotic film, and heaps a lot of praise onto Churchill's gusto, but that doesn't mean it's overly jingoistic. There may be a case that Brits watching the film will feel more emotion from its incredible passion, but I still feel that most of that comes from how well the character of Churchill is developed throughout, from a bumbling, mumbling, lovable old man to a truly honest and principled leader.\n\nFinally, we have to talk about Gary Oldman's performance, which is amazing. For one, thanks of course in part to the make-up and costume teams, it's pretty impossible to tell that you're watching Gary Oldman in this movie. But not only does he look nothing like Oldman, and so much more like Churchill, but everything about Oldman's performance, from the smallest details about Churchill to his fantastic passion and energy on screen, pulls you further and further into the moment, and creates an exceptionally convincing portrayal of the great man and the situation surrounding him, which I was blown away by.\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved Darkest Hour. It's an undoubtedly riveting historical drama about a crucial turning point in global history, but more than that, it's full of incredible energy from start to finish, with amazing and still appropriate humour throughout combined with stunning patriotic passion, making for a genuinely exciting and properly entertaining film that does so much more than your typical Oscar-bait fare.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":184944,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-12-22","keywords":"world war two,speech,prime minister,politics,winston churchill character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3915626777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk0OTM5MDIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2Nzk2MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk0OTM5MDIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2Nzk2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"This true story begins at the precipice of World War II as, within days of becoming Prime Minister of Great Britain, Winston Churchill (Academy Award nominee Gary Oldman) must face one of his most turbulent and defining trials: exploring a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany, or standing firm to fight for the ideals, liberty and freedom of a nation.

Normally that makes me suspicious. Films with too much advertising usually are bad and in desperate need of viewers. So I went to the cinema with a funny feeling in my stomach. I love to see both leading actors very much and do so for years. I don't care what they do, I go and see it. But of course I prefer a good film to a bad one. And I thought a film with both my best-loved French actors couldn't fail.\n\nAnd you know what? The funny feeling in my stomach... gone after the first five minutes!!! This is a typical Francis Veber film, but one of the better ones, definitely. I laughed so much, my jaw started hurting after a while. I can't say, that there were no stereotypes in there, that the story is brilliant or that the jokes were completely new. In this film what counts are the two leading performances next to strong supporting ones, the fact that there is no boring moment and the Francis Veber touch to the script. Afterwards, coming out of the cinema, I felt good for the rest of the day and I know I will buy the DVD when it comes out. Sometimes I think it's fair to define a good film just by the good feeling you have while watching it.\n\n9 out of 10."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28008,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2003-10-22","keywords":"prison escape,odd couple,on the run,buddy movie,manhunt","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3880435225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc5YjBkZmEtY2FkNS00NjJkLWIyMDUtYmU2MTg2MTgwYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc5YjBkZmEtY2FkNS00NjJkLWIyMDUtYmU2MTg2MTgwYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000367/","name":"Gérard Depardieu"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000606/","name":"Jean Reno"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006939/","name":"Richard Berry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039740/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046075/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296829/","name":"Serge Frydman"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Normally that makes me suspicious. Films with too much advertising usually are bad and in desperate need of viewers. So I went to the cinema with a funny feeling in my stomach. I love to see both leading actors very much and do so for years. I don't care what they do, I go and see it. But of course I prefer a good film to a bad one. And I thought a film with both my best-loved French actors couldn't fail.\n\nAnd you know what? The funny feeling in my stomach... gone after the first five minutes!!! This is a typical Francis Veber film, but one of the better ones, definitely. I laughed so much, my jaw started hurting after a while. I can't say, that there were no stereotypes in there, that the story is brilliant or that the jokes were completely new. In this film what counts are the two leading performances next to strong supporting ones, the fact that there is no boring moment and the Francis Veber touch to the script. Afterwards, coming out of the cinema, I felt good for the rest of the day and I know I will buy the DVD when it comes out. Sometimes I think it's fair to define a good film just by the good feeling you have while watching it.\n\n9 out of 10.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28008,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2003-10-22","keywords":"prison escape,odd couple,on the run,buddy movie,manhunt","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3880435225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc5YjBkZmEtY2FkNS00NjJkLWIyMDUtYmU2MTg2MTgwYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc5YjBkZmEtY2FkNS00NjJkLWIyMDUtYmU2MTg2MTgwYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000367/","name":"Gérard Depardieu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000606/","name":"Jean Reno","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006939/","name":"Richard Berry"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039740/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046075/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296829/","name":"Serge Frydman"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And this movie is no exception. My wife and I found wonderful texture in the use of minor plot points to enhance the larger story. For instance - the stray dog which at first is disliked and then accepted...the metaphor of caterpillar and butterfly. It was all very nicely done in a story that evolved at a leisurely pace and with the layers one would expect in a life. As person expecting to see fewer years than I have already seen I appreciate films that reflect some of what I have experienced - and some of which I wish I had experienced. Movies such as these remind us, also, of the value of looking ahead to what life can hold no matter the number of years that have crinkled your brows.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13505,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-07-25","keywords":"cell phone video,aerial camera shot,woman wears eyeglasses,movie flop,neighbor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"And So It Goes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3315841561","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDUxNjFmNTctMjRmYy00ZmMxLTliNmYtYjE3ZWUwZWE4NjI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDUxNjFmNTctMjRmYy00ZmMxLTliNmYtYjE3ZWUwZWE4NjI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for And So It Goes"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000473/","name":"Diane Keaton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3606106/","name":"Sterling Jerins"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001661/","name":"Rob Reiner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0485509/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242732/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0029125/","name":"Mark Andrus"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And this movie is no exception. My wife and I found wonderful texture in the use of minor plot points to enhance the larger story. For instance - the stray dog which at first is disliked and then accepted...the metaphor of caterpillar and butterfly. It was all very nicely done in a story that evolved at a leisurely pace and with the layers one would expect in a life. As person expecting to see fewer years than I have already seen I appreciate films that reflect some of what I have experienced - and some of which I wish I had experienced. Movies such as these remind us, also, of the value of looking ahead to what life can hold no matter the number of years that have crinkled your brows.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13505,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-07-25","keywords":"cell phone video,aerial camera shot,woman wears eyeglasses,movie flop,neighbor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"And So It Goes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3315841561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDUxNjFmNTctMjRmYy00ZmMxLTliNmYtYjE3ZWUwZWE4NjI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDUxNjFmNTctMjRmYy00ZmMxLTliNmYtYjE3ZWUwZWE4NjI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for And So It Goes","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000473/","name":"Diane Keaton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3606106/","name":"Sterling Jerins"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001661/","name":"Rob Reiner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0485509/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242732/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0029125/","name":"Mark Andrus"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is when the series starts to pick up steam. Watching the show, you can't help but laugh at Briscoe's remarks or feel the passion of McCoy. Both of these men want justice, and will do everything within limits to bring the wrongdoers to justice. What I really like about the show is the wonderful twists and turns that they throw to the audience, as well as the "ripped from the headlines" episodes.

Where so many mini-series are constantly driven by a thread that drives it forward with momentum, this doesn't have that same urgency, which allows it to explore its themes in a way I don't think many TV series or mini-series have done. It's so wonderfully crafted, in all aspects. But really, it's the writing and performances where its true power soars. The acting is magnificent, McDormand might've just outdone her work in Fargo. A truly soulful, aching, incredibly heartfelt performance. We see Olive and her various flaws, and yet we can't help but sympathize with her and like her despite everything she does. The mark of a true revelation. Kind of hard to describe in words, but the acclaim is justified.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20434,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-11-02","keywords":"tv mini series,pulitzer prize source,male female relationship,husband wife relationship,depression","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000531/","name":"Frances McDormand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0420955/","name":"Richard Jenkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154914/","name":"Ken Cheeseman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036575/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0527847/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi234204953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ1MzYwMjgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg3MzY4MjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ1MzYwMjgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODg3MzY4MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the official trailer for HBO's upcoming miniseries "Olive Kitteridge"."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Spain had become an empire by 1500's under Catholic Kings : Isabel and Fernando , Charles I and after Felipe II , the most poweful country in Europe and all over the world at the time . It is set in Sevilla, 16th century, one of the most marvellous and smelliest cities in the world , it is a time of plague , pursuit , superstition, as well as hyper-religiosity and during a terrible plague epidemic . There appears Mateo Nuñez : Pablo Molinero , he is a condemned by Inquisition, as a high-authority priest named Celso de Guevara : Manolo Solo assigns him to investigate a series of murders happened in the noisy city of Seville where more than forty different languages were spoken and all the gold from America arrived on its por t. In the midst of a dirty atmosphere suffocated by mistrust and betrayals on the order of the day , he will have to discover the author of such astonishing and grisly killings . The second season deals with Mateo Nuñez and Teresa Pinelo : Patricia López Arnaiz , who face off Maria de la O : Stefania de los Santos , and a dangerous and bloody criminal organization, Mafia-alike, called La Garduña operating in Sevilla by human trafficking , prostitution and labouring exploitation.\n\nNice costumer, dense and painfully realistic mystery thriller with solid performance , enjoyable locations , impeccable scenarios and lavishly filmed. Set in the post-Medieval Seville with its social constitution struck by the plague , it was one of the main cities of the Western world , known as the Great Babylon, it was home to people of all races and people of all kinds and strangest conditions . Do not expect luxurious palaces , sweet Renaissance settings and gorgeous decoration seen in other foreign series such Versalles, The Borgia , Michael Hirst's Tudor or Richard Madden's The Medici. On the contrary, you can appreciate sinister environments , brothels , dirtiness, bowery, city slums and the deepest poverty. As far as I'm concerned the especial writing is pretty well , being its authentic creators Rafael Cobos and Alberto Rodriguez. Convincingly performed by Pablo Molinero as Matthew who investigates the found corpses of several murdered people as an omen of the end of the world . Matthew will have to find out who is the author of a series of diabolical crimes committed against the high places of Sevillian society . Otherwise , he will not find the forgiveness of the Holy Office and the Inquisition as he will decide to investigate it at whatever means. Being finely accompanied by Patricia López Arnaiz as a mysterious factory owner , Paco Tous as her administrator assistant , Paco León, Manolo Solo, Cecilia Gómez, Sergio Castellanos, Manuel Morón , Melina Matthews, Estefania de Santos, Jesús Carroza, Julián Villagrán, Antonio Dechent, Luis Callejo , among others.\n\nIt displays an evocative and atmospheric musical score by Julio de la Rosa. It contains picturesque cinematography by cameramen Rau Steve and Andreu Adamo Rubiralta. Shot on several locations as Utrera, Coria del Rio, Dos Hermanas Carmona, Santiponce, Alcala de Guadaira, Gelves, Mairena, Puebla de Rio, Sevilla, Trujillo, Caceres, Palos de la Frontera, Huelva, Cuevas de Almanzora, Almeria, and Toledo. And we can find the real interiors of the Sevillian Palaces, Casa Contratation of Sevilla and sightseeing as the riverside, Giralda, Torre del Oro, Cathedral and other buildings, monuments by means of CGI. This surprising crime drama was well directed by Alberto Rodriguez. He is considered to be one of the best Spanish filmmakers, including notorious films as Grupo 7, Factor Pilgrim, 7 Virgins, The suit , El hombre de las 1000 caras, being his biggest hit : Marshland . Rating : above average, 7/10 for the accuracy in depicting the XVI century city , as the money are not waste, though not for too squeamish watchers due to its sour seeing of poorness, sleazy events, nudism , heinous killings and extreme realism .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1857,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-12","keywords":"plague,murder investigation,death,violence,blood","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1944825/","name":"Pablo Molinero","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3802082/","name":"Patricia López Arnaiz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1525783/","name":"Sergio Castellanos"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0296182/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0544623/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1943791/","name":"Rafael Cobos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735705/","name":"Alberto Rodríguez"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It got boring during the middle seasons, but season 6 was very good. I have mixed emotions about season 7. They provided a lot of interesting back story for a few characters, but they left a lot of loose threads at the end.\n\nThe whole series showed way too much of Ray's daughter. She got somewhat interesting in Season 6, but then I, once again, lost interest in her during season 7.\n\nI'm glad Ray's son wasn't shown much during the last few seasons. He was an annoying character from the beginning.\n\nOverall, it's a good show if you can stick with the boring bits.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-06-18","keywords":"female investigator,nudity,fixer,fbi agent,brother sister relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000630/","name":"Liev Schreiber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0550371/","name":"Eddie Marsan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005231/","name":"Dash Mihok"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093837/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0081189/","name":"Ann Biderman"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 7 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2778578713","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVhY2M3OGYtYjRjOS00MmFjLWFlNTItOWFlOThlMmZjOTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVhY2M3OGYtYjRjOS00MmFjLWFlNTItOWFlOThlMmZjOTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"While Ray makes personal progress, there are dangers that require the Ray Donovan of old.

However when the British burn his home and heartlessly kill one of his young sons, Martin knows he must take a stand and enters the conflict. With great personal sacrifice he joins the bloody conflict for freedom and honour and the love of his country.\n\nIn his episode of The Simpsons, Mel Gibson starred in a remake of Mr Smith Goes to Washington except Homer helped him to change it into a film that was closer to Lethal Weapon than the James Stewart original. That was a joke, but having just watched Mel Gibson turn the American Civil War into a sort of revenge action movie I considered that perhaps Homer had a hand in this one too and that the joke was on us for spending three hours watching it. It starts out with a bit of moral chat about the importance of peace etc but one dead son later and Benjamin Martin has become a one-man war machine, wiping out 20 British soldiers in a blink of an eye. It is the start of a morally simplistic film that offers little for those looking for a historical piece. In fairness the film never actually aims to be anything other than a modern action movie in a historical setting but having low ambitious doesn't mean it can't be criticised for being crap  because that is just what it is.\n\nSo we have the pantomime villains of the English killing women and children while the good wholesome American people (most of whom employ blacks to pick cotton rather than use slaves) try to do the right thing but are drawn into a bloody fight for freedom and justice. It is as simplistic as it sounds and every time Emmerich fears that his audience are losing touch with who the bad guys are, he'll have them burn kill a load of women with gleeful glints in their eyes. It gets tiresome very quickly and the fact that it is three hours long (give or take  I'd prefer to take) just makes it worse. Visually it looks as good as you would expect a big budget production to do but substance-wise it is just nonsense, with overblown (if impressive) battle sequences which laughably include lots of John Woo style use of guns, slow-mo and catching weapons in mid-air before using them. The bits in between the action are no better as they are merely twists of an emotional knife that the writer must have hoped would make us overlook how simplified everything is; I was waiting for the scene where Col Tavington drowned kittens in a sack to demonstrate how evil he was. No, this is not a film to come to for debate because as far as Rodat is concerned, that is all done and dusted in the early stages and then completely dismissed as nonsense by the next 160 minutes of film. I'm not going to even get into the historical liberties taken because even ignoring them this is still a terrible load of rubbish.\n\nOnce the film gets going, Mel Gibson only does a couple of things: he is either cocky (like Riggs), brave (like Braveheart) or full of indignation and swelling pride in his country. He flicks between these like someone was turning a switch in his back; he is never consistent and he is never a real person  in fact he is never anyone other than Mel Gibson. Heath Ledger gives a simplistic performance but with no material to work with, what could he do? I don't know why Richardson bothered to show up although I can appreciate that Karyo and Wilkinson have mortgages to pay just like the rest of us. I don't give the same excuse to Cooper because he always struck me as an intelligent actor who makes good decisions  he is really too good to be earning his money from this.

However when the British burn his home and heartlessly kill one of his young sons, Martin knows he must take a stand and enters the conflict. With great personal sacrifice he joins the bloody conflict for freedom and honour and the love of his country.\n\nIn his episode of The Simpsons, Mel Gibson starred in a remake of Mr Smith Goes to Washington except Homer helped him to change it into a film that was closer to Lethal Weapon than the James Stewart original. That was a joke, but having just watched Mel Gibson turn the American Civil War into a sort of revenge action movie I considered that perhaps Homer had a hand in this one too and that the joke was on us for spending three hours watching it. It starts out with a bit of moral chat about the importance of peace etc but one dead son later and Benjamin Martin has become a one-man war machine, wiping out 20 British soldiers in a blink of an eye. It is the start of a morally simplistic film that offers little for those looking for a historical piece. In fairness the film never actually aims to be anything other than a modern action movie in a historical setting but having low ambitious doesn't mean it can't be criticised for being crap  because that is just what it is.\n\nSo we have the pantomime villains of the English killing women and children while the good wholesome American people (most of whom employ blacks to pick cotton rather than use slaves) try to do the right thing but are drawn into a bloody fight for freedom and justice. It is as simplistic as it sounds and every time Emmerich fears that his audience are losing touch with who the bad guys are, he'll have them burn kill a load of women with gleeful glints in their eyes. It gets tiresome very quickly and the fact that it is three hours long (give or take  I'd prefer to take) just makes it worse. Visually it looks as good as you would expect a big budget production to do but substance-wise it is just nonsense, with overblown (if impressive) battle sequences which laughably include lots of John Woo style use of guns, slow-mo and catching weapons in mid-air before using them. The bits in between the action are no better as they are merely twists of an emotional knife that the writer must have hoped would make us overlook how simplified everything is; I was waiting for the scene where Col Tavington drowned kittens in a sack to demonstrate how evil he was. No, this is not a film to come to for debate because as far as Rodat is concerned, that is all done and dusted in the early stages and then completely dismissed as nonsense by the next 160 minutes of film. I'm not going to even get into the historical liberties taken because even ignoring them this is still a terrible load of rubbish.\n\nOnce the film gets going, Mel Gibson only does a couple of things: he is either cocky (like Riggs), brave (like Braveheart) or full of indignation and swelling pride in his country. He flicks between these like someone was turning a switch in his back; he is never consistent and he is never a real person  in fact he is never anyone other than Mel Gibson. Heath Ledger gives a simplistic performance but with no material to work with, what could he do? I don't know why Richardson bothered to show up although I can appreciate that Karyo and Wilkinson have mortgages to pay just like the rest of us. I don't give the same excuse to Cooper because he always struck me as an intelligent actor who makes good decisions  he is really too good to be earning his money from this. The support all do what they are told but I don't want to be too hard on the majority of the cast simply because the material is not there and nobody can do good work with characters that would seem underdeveloped on children's television.\n\nOverall this is a good looking and noisy action movie and as such it might just please audiences that like lots of things blowing up and Americans being the good guys. However for the majority of viewers the simplistic material, stomach-churning flag-waving, emotional exploitation and dumb action movie clichés. It is nonsense from start to finish in my opinion and it is not worth 90 minutes, far less 170.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262306,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2000-07-19","keywords":"american revolution,hero,standoff,father son relationship,george washington character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Patriot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi100139289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcxNjY2N2MtNjllYy00OGE1LTgxMmYtZjYwOTc2MzEyYzVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODcxNjY2N2MtNjllYy00OGE1LTgxMmYtZjYwOTc2MzEyYzVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Touchstone Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005132/","name":"Heath Ledger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000613/","name":"Joely Richardson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007500/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"],"duration":"PT2H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Both have a similar concept; Liam goes on a fast-paced journey to retrieve something special that has been taken from him. This time it is not his daughter; it is his mind. Unlike "Taken," "Unknown" is more of a suspense mystery than an action flick. There are some chases and fight scenes, but that is not the main focus. The movie's plot is focus and it is unique for it is unpredictable. We are confused like Neeson's character and there are times we don't know if he will succeed. There are multiple twists and unlike most mystery thrillers, it took me more than half through the film to figure it all out.\n\nIn short, "Unknown" is a fairly decent mystery thriller. Good performances. Good story for a mystery. Good music. Good cinematography—I particularly like the whole gray, dreary atmosphere that reflects the film's location's bleak weather. Good twists. Good suspense— the sound mixers must've had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience. The one thing I will note is that Liam Neeson is really showing his age. This is not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it helps his character out. It gets tiresome that Hollywood always uses the generic 30-something year old actor with smashing abs who is tossed into a terrible situation. It is nice to see an aging actor play an upper middle-aged man who has perhaps lost his mind while running away from people trying to kill him.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":255393,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-03-23","keywords":"amnesia,coma,airport,scientist,nurse","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unknown: International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1552980505","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA4NjYwMDYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE1NTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTA4NjYwMDYzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE1NTgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A man awakens from a coma, only to discover that someone has taken on his identity and that no one, (not even his wife), believes him.

Since he started in films in the early 80s he has either been the STAR, the star, the co-star, or a mere cameo. There has been precious little in between.\n\nUntil now.\n\nIn an are in China where many warlords fought and struggled over territory and power, the Chinese Army were cruel and violent pricks – at least that's how they are portrayed here.\n\nOne of the worst of these was leader General Hou Jie, he callously orders the killing of innocent villagers for fear that they may possibly be harbouring the enemy, and the killing of the enemy because  well they're the enemy (can't argue that one). When his reluctant 2IC Cao Man expresses doubt at the level of violence and whether those targeted even deserve what is being dished out he receives an impromptu lesson: 'it is better to be the aggressor and be wrong than the passive dead guy', or something along those lines.\n\nOn this day though they follow an enemy into peaceful monk territory, a Shaolin temple. While the monks refuse to take sides they will not allow violence on their turf, and they protect the man. Initially.\n\nHou Jie backs down on his word and guns down the soldier in an act of proactive violence, pausing on the way out only to deface some sacred Shaloin signage. He gets home to his wife and adoring daughter who proudly shows him a drawing of him in action with the title 'My Daddy likes fighting' (I shouldn't judge, my boy might say 'My Daddy likes chips and beer!) Back in cautiously peaceful time Hou Jie becomes increasingly nervous about the prospect of being betrayed or attacked – even by his good friend and ally. In another unnecessary pre-emptive strike Hao Jie takes his friend out in cold blood purely to advance his own station and eradicate another potential rival and hindrance to his success.\n\nUnfortunately though Hou Jie's actions and teaching eventually (and inevitably) work against him, his former 2IC Cao Man betrays him and Hou Jie must seek refuge immediately  but where? What follows is a generally rewarding tale of realisation and redemption. Jackie Chan (see how long it took to even mention him!) plays a humble and peaceful – yet eccentric – cook who kindly takes Hou Jie under his care.\n\nAfter a period of time Hou Jie embraces the life of a monk montage-style, shaving his head a la Britney for a clean start – albeit without the insanity – and finds peace  for now. Because meanwhile Cao Man has effortlessly and successfully stepped into his shoes and is now just as ruthless and violent a leader.\n\nConfusingly enough in a film about a violent and cruel man realising the error of his ways we always know that this pro-peace film will end in violence, and the action in the latter part of the film is worth the wait. There is an ax-fight that seemed quite realistic and dangerous, a chariot chase (of sorts) and the wire work was used sparingly enough to be forgiven for the most part. Andy Lau proves himself an adept and reasonably athletic martial artist, and there is no shortage of random monks ready to throw down  in self defense of course.\n\nIt takes a long while but even Jackie Chan gets to try his aching muscles out near the end of the film, even though in truth his entire role and fighting scenes are thematically at odds with the rest of the film and stand out like a sore thumb. It is like Jackie has now entered the Brian Dennehy / Morgan Freeman phase of his career as the elder statesman, only every director – and perhaps even Jackie himself – can't help but remember that he was once the pre-eminent cinematic martial artist on the planet, so they clumsily try to work him in.\n\nShaolin is a film book-ended by violence, the redemptive tale in the middle is supposed to provide the moral of the story I guess, but that could easily be forgotten by the 30 minute finale that ends in many dead when even the monks say 'enough'.\n\nFinal Rating – 6 / 10.

Lowry and Burnett are called in because they were the ones who captured the heroin in the first place, and because of the one trait they share -- a renegade approach to police work, which may not have their boss's approval, but which does get the job done (and at one point, causes a store owner to think they're out to rob him).

When his reluctant 2IC Cao Man expresses doubt at the level of violence and whether those targeted even deserve what is being dished out he receives an impromptu lesson: 'it is better to be the aggressor and be wrong than the passive dead guy', or something along those lines.\n\nOn this day though they follow an enemy into peaceful monk territory, a Shaolin temple. While the monks refuse to take sides they will not allow violence on their turf, and they protect the man. Initially.\n\nHou Jie backs down on his word and guns down the soldier in an act of proactive violence, pausing on the way out only to deface some sacred Shaloin signage. He gets home to his wife and adoring daughter who proudly shows him a drawing of him in action with the title 'My Daddy likes fighting' (I shouldn't judge, my boy might say 'My Daddy likes chips and beer!) Back in cautiously peaceful time Hou Jie becomes increasingly nervous about the prospect of being betrayed or attacked – even by his good friend and ally. In another unnecessary pre-emptive strike Hao Jie takes his friend out in cold blood purely to advance his own station and eradicate another potential rival and hindrance to his success.\n\nUnfortunately though Hou Jie's actions and teaching eventually (and inevitably) work against him, his former 2IC Cao Man betrays him and Hou Jie must seek refuge immediately  but where? What follows is a generally rewarding tale of realisation and redemption. Jackie Chan (see how long it took to even mention him!) plays a humble and peaceful – yet eccentric – cook who kindly takes Hou Jie under his care.\n\nAfter a period of time Hou Jie embraces the life of a monk montage-style, shaving his head a la Britney for a clean start – albeit without the insanity – and finds peace  for now. Because meanwhile Cao Man has effortlessly and successfully stepped into his shoes and is now just as ruthless and violent a leader.\n\nConfusingly enough in a film about a violent and cruel man realising the error of his ways we always know that this pro-peace film will end in violence, and the action in the latter part of the film is worth the wait. There is an ax-fight that seemed quite realistic and dangerous, a chariot chase (of sorts) and the wire work was used sparingly enough to be forgiven for the most part. Andy Lau proves himself an adept and reasonably athletic martial artist, and there is no shortage of random monks ready to throw down  in self defense of course.\n\nIt takes a long while but even Jackie Chan gets to try his aching muscles out near the end of the film, even though in truth his entire role and fighting scenes are thematically at odds with the rest of the film and stand out like a sore thumb. It is like Jackie has now entered the Brian Dennehy / Morgan Freeman phase of his career as the elder statesman, only every director – and perhaps even Jackie himself – can't help but remember that he was once the pre-eminent cinematic martial artist on the planet, so they clumsily try to work him in.\n\nShaolin is a film book-ended by violence, the redemptive tale in the middle is supposed to provide the moral of the story I guess, but that could easily be forgotten by the 30 minute finale that ends in many dead when even the monks say 'enough'.\n\nFinal Rating – 6 / 10.

Both have a similar concept; Liam goes on a fast-paced journey to retrieve something special that has been taken from him. This time it is not his daughter; it is his mind. Unlike "Taken," "Unknown" is more of a suspense mystery than an action flick. There are some chases and fight scenes, but that is not the main focus. The movie's plot is focus and it is unique for it is unpredictable. We are confused like Neeson's character and there are times we don't know if he will succeed. There are multiple twists and unlike most mystery thrillers, it took me more than half through the film to figure it all out.\n\nIn short, "Unknown" is a fairly decent mystery thriller. Good performances. Good story for a mystery. Good music. Good cinematography—I particularly like the whole gray, dreary atmosphere that reflects the film's location's bleak weather. Good twists. Good suspense— the sound mixers must've had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience. The one thing I will note is that Liam Neeson is really showing his age.

Both have a similar concept; Liam goes on a fast-paced journey to retrieve something special that has been taken from him. This time it is not his daughter; it is his mind. Unlike "Taken," "Unknown" is more of a suspense mystery than an action flick. There are some chases and fight scenes, but that is not the main focus. The movie's plot is focus and it is unique for it is unpredictable. We are confused like Neeson's character and there are times we don't know if he will succeed. There are multiple twists and unlike most mystery thrillers, it took me more than half through the film to figure it all out.\n\nIn short, "Unknown" is a fairly decent mystery thriller. Good performances. Good story for a mystery. Good music. Good cinematography—I particularly like the whole gray, dreary atmosphere that reflects the film's location's bleak weather. Good twists. Good suspense— the sound mixers must've had a kick in adding emphasis on sound effects to startle the audience. The one thing I will note is that Liam Neeson is really showing his age. This is not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it helps his character out. It gets tiresome that Hollywood always uses the generic 30-something year old actor with smashing abs who is tossed into a terrible situation.

But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.\n\nWhile I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Misérables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.\n\nThere's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Misérables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.\n\nFirst, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.\n\nNext, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.\n\nHooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.\n\nThe pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.\n\nIn that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.\n\nCats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.\n\nThat story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.\n\nA little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.\n\nFrancesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.\n\nThere's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.\n\nAs a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.\n\nSo, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.\n\nIn short, Cats is an absolute atrocity. From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.\n\nThere's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":46283,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-12-20","keywords":"elderly people,worst picture razzie winner,dancing,uncanny valley,singing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2898837273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179479/","name":"James Corden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3716653/","name":"Jason Derulo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346224/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355822/","name":"Lee Hall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515908/","name":"Andrew Lloyd Webber"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.\n\nThere's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":46283,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-12-20","keywords":"elderly people,worst picture razzie winner,dancing,uncanny valley,singing","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2898837273","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTA3NmU1NDMtYzcxMC00ZjI5LTllZWItYWI3MmZkNTE1ZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1hcmNtYW5u._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179479/","name":"James Corden","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3716653/","name":"Jason Derulo"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346224/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355822/","name":"Lee Hall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0515908/","name":"Andrew Lloyd Webber"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you are not into romantic tear jerkers, watch this film and find out that your human and have the ability to change your mind. I speak from experience. The story: Simple and easy to understand. The director made a simple life event into a magical experience. Love and death go hand in hand in a mixture of sublime acting, awesome sceneries, superb dialogues, nerve touching details and result in a romantic drama where the sadness and emotions do not cover the happy ending and leaves you choked till the last over the rainbow tune ends. After 40 years of watching thousands of films, this film still is my number 1 film in my top 100 films where all one hundred share the first place. Brad Pitt, Sir Anthony Hopkins (brilliant classical composer btw) and the gorgeous Claire Forlany showed of their qualities. Same for all the other participants in thisepic story about how life will go on. Perception. ... but from my pov their best acting ever. I have seen it at least once every 2 years.

If you are not into romantic tear jerkers, watch this film and find out that your human and have the ability to change your mind. I speak from experience. The story: Simple and easy to understand. The director made a simple life event into a magical experience. Love and death go hand in hand in a mixture of sublime acting, awesome sceneries, superb dialogues, nerve touching details and result in a romantic drama where the sadness and emotions do not cover the happy ending and leaves you choked till the last over the rainbow tune ends. After 40 years of watching thousands of films, this film still is my number 1 film in my top 100 films where all one hundred share the first place. Brad Pitt, Sir Anthony Hopkins (brilliant classical composer btw) and the gorgeous Claire Forlany showed of their qualities. Same for all the other participants in thisepic story about how life will go on. Perception. ... but from my pov their best acting ever. I have seen it at least once every 2 years. If it will be your first time, settle for it. If you are still young, and think you become a film addict, be aware! You will get drawn in this film for decades to come. Enjoy this experience.

THIS is the computer game - THE MATRIX was the movie!\n\nTo be expected, the flick has its die-hard adherents who would happily take a lie-detector test to convince us that they alone can penetrate the bulldust and fathom a master-plan in progress. This armored, but essentially - cranially displaced movie, is, like the sum of Morpheus' spoutings, heavy on pretense, light on significance. Fishburne's Moses-inspired "address to the nation" atop Pride Rock, must rank as the most non-sensical piece of dialog ever uttered in a movie. Even HE looks utterly embarrassed to be there, frequently pausing as if wondering "WHAT did I just say?" The entire sequence in fact, including the orgiastic rave with a BLADE soundtrack, appears to have been inspired by THE TEN COMMANDMENTS.\n\nAs for THAT completely loopy and sex-less coupling with Carrie Ann Moss, I had to avert my eyes for fear of being rendered sterile! (Talk about LOT's wife!) C'mon....the woman looks old enough to be Reeve's mother and unintentionally cruel though it is, has any love interest ever been less attractive in the history of cinema? Reeves MUST have been wearing shades to do it! (Footnote to Miss Moss: No insult intended Carrie, I'm no better - way past my own use-by date but hey, LOVED the catwoman outfit!)\n\n Reeves in fact appears majorly stilted and wooden throughout proceedings here (yeah, I know that IS par for the course for dear old Keanu, but Hell, couldn't NEO (gosh thats brilliant - anagram of ONE,  Thank you HAL!) have had just a little fun? As for his excruciatingly prolonged brawl with the replicated Agent Smiths....what the HELL was that?.....realistic? meaningful? intellectual? spiritual? None of the above, this was pretentious, laughable, overlong and irritating. Did LESS than nothing for the flick's credibility. One may also well ask, why, with his ability to leap tall buildings and fly at warp factor 10, would he even be bothered with such mundane fisticuffs in the first place? If he can repel bullets and the considerably better equipped aliens simply by holding his hand up, whats the deal here with the army of Weavings?  The sequence of course was not intended for logical contemplation. simply to impart to the popcorn-munching cretins that "hey, ain't this one FUN movie?"\n\nQuantum physics, Crane-crap, Zen Buddhism, Armani fashions, Cecil B De Mille, Fritz Lang and Jacke Chan aside, what are we LEFT with here?  A half-decent freeway chase and ONLY the second other intelligent part of the movie - the sequence with the architect. The latter being the greatest, most perceptive and well delivered flurry of meaningful adjectival literacy since Lord Henry gave Dorian a lesson in societal objectivity in THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY. I cannot believe that greater than 2% of the MATRIX RELOADED's entire audience worldwide would have had the slightest idea of what was being said!\n\nThe less said about the ending (and I use the term loosely), the better. You want thought provoking Sci-fi? stick with 2001 or BLADE RUNNER. You want action?  MAD MAX 2: THE ROAD WARRIOR leaves this for dead and WITHOUT CGI. You want superb characterisation? try BILLY BUDD on for size. Maybe gothic brilliance is your thing? THE INNOCENTS awaits you! You wanna be swept along with the crowd?  better catch MATRIX RELOADED (actually a sequel to THE EMPEROR'S NEW CLOTHES) before you actually get a chance to think!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":537578,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-02-11","keywords":"oracle,prophecy,alternate reality,car motorcycle chase,stylized violence","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Matrix Reloaded","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3086352665","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWM3OGI1OTctNDVjNC00NzE1LThkOTYtMDllZGJiOTQ2Mzc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWM3OGI1OTctNDVjNC00NzE1LThkOTYtMDllZGJiOTQ2Mzc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000206/","name":"Keanu Reeves","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000401/","name":"Laurence Fishburne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005251/","name":"Carrie-Anne Moss"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905154/","name":"Lana Wachowski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905152/","name":"Lilly Wachowski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019968/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905152/","name":"Lilly Wachowski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905154/","name":"Lana Wachowski"],"duration":"PT2H18M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Hail stones the size of footballs decimate cities, typhoons destroy Los Angeles and New York becomes flooded. As the big freeze crosses the northern hemisphere, a small group of survivors try to fend off the cold as the world prepares for a dramatic change in the world order.\n\nThis film may be a modern blockbuster but in almost everyway it is a 1970's disaster movie where an event happens after some build up and we then spend the rest of the film watching the survivors trying to, well, survive. In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. For this reason the first hour is great  it has dramatic pace, is involving and looks fantastic even if we have seen it before in different variations (how many times has New York been destroyed now?). However after the sheer global terror is pretty much finished we suddenly become much more small scale and the film looses much of it's impact and it's pace. After the initial danger has passed the film uses illogical and silly plot devices to put the survivors at risk  a cold eye of a storm, blood infections, creeping ice and wolves are among the problems. While this is OK on a genre level it doesn't compare to the first hour and it gets a little dull and plodding at times.\n\nThe clichés are all present and correct: the politicians, the upright scientists, the sacrifice, the daring rescues and so on. It's fair to say that if you are looking for more than a basic script then you will be looking in the wrong place here. All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action  if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. The film tries to deliver an environmental message but in a way this film will not help the environmental movement because it is too exaggerated to be taken seriously (like the idea of Celtic and Man Utd reaching the Champions League final  during this season? Please!), however it does include several surprisingly barbed attacks on the US administration (could the VP look any more like Cheney?). Just a shame that the film message is delivered with all the subtlety that Segal showed when he did something similar in his environmental action film On Deadly Ground.\n\nThe script doesn't really create characters either and it means we don't care that much about what happens to them in the final hour (countless millions are dead for goodness sake!). The dialogue in the first hour is nicely gruff and scientific and very genre but the second hour is more human and the lines aren't suited for that  not even in the hands of an impressive number of good actors. I like Quaid and he is a good lead here, he gets the good scientific stuff and only is lumbered with the rather silly notion of walking to New York from Washington. Gyllenhaal must have upset legions of cult fan boys by appearing in a big budget movie but he does OK with the role (despite looking too old to be in school). The rest of the cast are fairly mixed but, as with the genre, they are just filled even if some are good. Welsh is good even if he was cast for his similarity to Dick Cheney, Holm adds a small bit of dignity in his role as well as being supported by the very fine actor Lester in a minor role. Faces like Sanders, Mihok and a few others don't really matter as they are merely victims waiting for their turn to be used for dramatic effect.\n\nOverall the first hour of this film is good on a blockbuster level, but it blows it's wad too early (don't ya hate it when that happens?!) and is left with a second hour that is right out of the 1970's with all the weaknesses that that entails. Generally I enjoyed the film because I was just expecting a big noisy movie to pass a few hours  bad script, no characters and lots of clichés? Why would I be surprised by that? It's par for the course and you should not watch this if you know these aspects will annoy you. As it is, it's an average film but one that is noisy and spectacular enough to pass muster in the summer blockbuster stakes."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":428618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-05-26","keywords":"global warming,end of the world,climate crisis,climate,weather","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Day After Tomorrow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3008019993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljZjVhMGMtYjM3ZS00YWFmLWE2NjAtMjJjYjRkMmMxNjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljZjVhMGMtYjM3ZS00YWFmLWE2NjAtMjJjYjRkMmMxNjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002536/","name":"Emmy Rossum"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060306/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0618680/","name":"Jeffrey Nachmanoff"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Welsh is good even if he was cast for his similarity to Dick Cheney, Holm adds a small bit of dignity in his role as well as being supported by the very fine actor Lester in a minor role. Faces like Sanders, Mihok and a few others don't really matter as they are merely victims waiting for their turn to be used for dramatic effect.\n\nOverall the first hour of this film is good on a blockbuster level, but it blows it's wad too early (don't ya hate it when that happens?!) and is left with a second hour that is right out of the 1970's with all the weaknesses that that entails. Generally I enjoyed the film because I was just expecting a big noisy movie to pass a few hours  bad script, no characters and lots of clichés? Why would I be surprised by that? It's par for the course and you should not watch this if you know these aspects will annoy you. As it is, it's an average film but one that is noisy and spectacular enough to pass muster in the summer blockbuster stakes.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":428618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-05-26","keywords":"global warming,end of the world,climate crisis,climate,weather","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Day After Tomorrow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3008019993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljZjVhMGMtYjM3ZS00YWFmLWE2NjAtMjJjYjRkMmMxNjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljZjVhMGMtYjM3ZS00YWFmLWE2NjAtMjJjYjRkMmMxNjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002536/","name":"Emmy Rossum"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060306/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0618680/","name":"Jeffrey Nachmanoff"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For some reason people have these attitudes towards movies that aren't packed with insane plot holes and story details wrapped up in a cgi blanket to attempt to blow your mind. This movie is really a funny movie, no matter what anyone says. My girlfriend was having a bad day and I was low on energy to try to entertain so we went to see this for a few laughs. It didn't disappoint. I didn't go in with high hopes that there would be any real reason to like it very much but it came around within the first few minutes of the movie. We both left feeling better and like it was worth it, (and I am an adult so the 'teenager type jokes' that one reviewer referred to are unfounded). Jake Johnson really sells the image of a guy just looking for any kind of change in his life and Damon Wayans Jr. is and actor that really puts a lot of work into whatever role he is in. I don't want to ruin any of the movie with bits and pieces that I enjoyed more than the others so I am leaving you with this. If you have a desire to get enjoyment from a film without becoming emotionally invested in a story that lasts 3 movies or longer with hints and clues popping up all over the place eluding to a next installment of whatever series, (and enjoy comedy of all types) then I would recommend this highly.

For some reason people have these attitudes towards movies that aren't packed with insane plot holes and story details wrapped up in a cgi blanket to attempt to blow your mind. This movie is really a funny movie, no matter what anyone says. My girlfriend was having a bad day and I was low on energy to try to entertain so we went to see this for a few laughs. It didn't disappoint. I didn't go in with high hopes that there would be any real reason to like it very much but it came around within the first few minutes of the movie. We both left feeling better and like it was worth it, (and I am an adult so the 'teenager type jokes' that one reviewer referred to are unfounded). Jake Johnson really sells the image of a guy just looking for any kind of change in his life and Damon Wayans Jr. is and actor that really puts a lot of work into whatever role he is in. I don't want to ruin any of the movie with bits and pieces that I enjoyed more than the others so I am leaving you with this. If you have a desire to get enjoyment from a film without becoming emotionally invested in a story that lasts 3 movies or longer with hints and clues popping up all over the place eluding to a next installment of whatever series, (and enjoy comedy of all types) then I would recommend this highly. Not artistic, not over done, not offensive to the degree some say, just straight up good comedy. Waaay better than the terrible Seth Rogen movie "the Neighbors".

At the end, is not gonna compete against the great drama-action movies, but is a good movie to have some fun and practice German.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4129,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-09-27","keywords":"witness protection program,man in a wheelchair,hiding in a car,war veteran,diabetic","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1485637/","name":"Numan Acar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5034946/","name":"Volker Albers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1653163/","name":"Loyd Bateman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001709/","name":"Til Schweiger"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0127588/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124661/","name":"Stephen Butchard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4766551/","name":"Paul Maurice","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001709/","name":"Til Schweiger"],"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="de">The Day After Tomorrow: Directed by Roland Emmerich. With Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhaal, Emmy Rossum, Dash Mihok. Jack Hall, paleoclimatologist, must make a daring trek from Washington, D.C. to New York City to reach his son, trapped in the cross-hairs of a sudden international storm which plunges the planet into a new Ice Age." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0319262/","name":"The Day After Tomorrow","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3NDU4NDA2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzcxNjY2._V1_.jpg","description":"Jack Hall, paleoclimatologist, must make a daring trek from Washington, D.C. to New York City to reach his son, trapped in the cross-hairs of a sudden international storm which plunges the planet into a new Ice Age.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0319262/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"bob the moo"},"dateCreated":"2004-05-31","inLanguage":"English","name":"Clichéd, illogical, unscientific but the first hour really delivers even if the second hour is like the 1970's never happened","reviewBody":"After years of warning about global warning, Jack Hall is horrified to find all his predictions coming true much faster than he could have imagined. Hail stones the size of footballs decimate cities, typhoons destroy Los Angeles and New York becomes flooded. As the big freeze crosses the northern hemisphere, a small group of survivors try to fend off the cold as the world prepares for a dramatic change in the world order.\n\nThis film may be a modern blockbuster but in almost everyway it is a 1970's disaster movie where an event happens after some build up and we then spend the rest of the film watching the survivors trying to, well, survive. In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. For this reason the first hour is great  it has dramatic pace, is involving and looks fantastic even if we have seen it before in different variations (how many times has New York been destroyed now?). However after the sheer global terror is pretty much finished we suddenly become much more small scale and the film looses much of it's impact and it's pace. After the initial danger has passed the film uses illogical and silly plot devices to put the survivors at risk  a cold eye of a storm, blood infections, creeping ice and wolves are among the problems. While this is OK on a genre level it doesn't compare to the first hour and it gets a little dull and plodding at times.\n\nThe clichés are all present and correct: the politicians, the upright scientists, the sacrifice, the daring rescues and so on. It's fair to say that if you are looking for more than a basic script then you will be looking in the wrong place here. All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action  if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. The film tries to deliver an environmental message but in a way this film will not help the environmental movement because it is too exaggerated to be taken seriously (like the idea of Celtic and Man Utd reaching the Champions League final  during this season? Please!), however it does include several surprisingly barbed attacks on the US administration (could the VP look any more like Cheney?). Just a shame that the film message is delivered with all the subtlety that Segal showed when he did something similar in his environmental action film On Deadly Ground.\n\nThe script doesn't really create characters either and it means we don't care that much about what happens to them in the final hour (countless millions are dead for goodness sake!). The dialogue in the first hour is nicely gruff and scientific and very genre but the second hour is more human and the lines aren't suited for that  not even in the hands of an impressive number of good actors. I like Quaid and he is a good lead here, he gets the good scientific stuff and only is lumbered with the rather silly notion of walking to New York from Washington. Gyllenhaal must have upset legions of cult fan boys by appearing in a big budget movie but he does OK with the role (despite looking too old to be in school). The rest of the cast are fairly mixed but, as with the genre, they are just filled even if some are good. Welsh is good even if he was cast for his similarity to Dick Cheney, Holm adds a small bit of dignity in his role as well as being supported by the very fine actor Lester in a minor role. Faces like Sanders, Mihok and a few others don't really matter as they are merely victims waiting for their turn to be used for dramatic effect.\n\nOverall the first hour of this film is good on a blockbuster level, but it blows it's wad too early (don't ya hate it when that happens?!) and is left with a second hour that is right out of the 1970's with all the weaknesses that that entails.

Hail stones the size of footballs decimate cities, typhoons destroy Los Angeles and New York becomes flooded. As the big freeze crosses the northern hemisphere, a small group of survivors try to fend off the cold as the world prepares for a dramatic change in the world order.\n\nThis film may be a modern blockbuster but in almost everyway it is a 1970's disaster movie where an event happens after some build up and we then spend the rest of the film watching the survivors trying to, well, survive. In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. For this reason the first hour is great  it has dramatic pace, is involving and looks fantastic even if we have seen it before in different variations (how many times has New York been destroyed now?). However after the sheer global terror is pretty much finished we suddenly become much more small scale and the film looses much of it's impact and it's pace. After the initial danger has passed the film uses illogical and silly plot devices to put the survivors at risk  a cold eye of a storm, blood infections, creeping ice and wolves are among the problems. While this is OK on a genre level it doesn't compare to the first hour and it gets a little dull and plodding at times.\n\nThe clichés are all present and correct: the politicians, the upright scientists, the sacrifice, the daring rescues and so on. It's fair to say that if you are looking for more than a basic script then you will be looking in the wrong place here. All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action  if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. The film tries to deliver an environmental message but in a way this film will not help the environmental movement because it is too exaggerated to be taken seriously (like the idea of Celtic and Man Utd reaching the Champions League final  during this season? Please!), however it does include several surprisingly barbed attacks on the US administration (could the VP look any more like Cheney?). Just a shame that the film message is delivered with all the subtlety that Segal showed when he did something similar in his environmental action film On Deadly Ground.\n\nThe script doesn't really create characters either and it means we don't care that much about what happens to them in the final hour (countless millions are dead for goodness sake!). The dialogue in the first hour is nicely gruff and scientific and very genre but the second hour is more human and the lines aren't suited for that  not even in the hands of an impressive number of good actors. I like Quaid and he is a good lead here, he gets the good scientific stuff and only is lumbered with the rather silly notion of walking to New York from Washington. Gyllenhaal must have upset legions of cult fan boys by appearing in a big budget movie but he does OK with the role (despite looking too old to be in school). The rest of the cast are fairly mixed but, as with the genre, they are just filled even if some are good. Welsh is good even if he was cast for his similarity to Dick Cheney, Holm adds a small bit of dignity in his role as well as being supported by the very fine actor Lester in a minor role. Faces like Sanders, Mihok and a few others don't really matter as they are merely victims waiting for their turn to be used for dramatic effect.\n\nOverall the first hour of this film is good on a blockbuster level, but it blows it's wad too early (don't ya hate it when that happens?!) and is left with a second hour that is right out of the 1970's with all the weaknesses that that entails. Generally I enjoyed the film because I was just expecting a big noisy movie to pass a few hours  bad script, no characters and lots of clichés? Why would I be surprised by that? It's par for the course and you should not watch this if you know these aspects will annoy you. As it is, it's an average film but one that is noisy and spectacular enough to pass muster in the summer blockbuster stakes.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":428618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-05-26","keywords":"global warming,end of the world,climate crisis,climate,weather","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Day After Tomorrow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3008019993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljZjVhMGMtYjM3ZS00YWFmLWE2NjAtMjJjYjRkMmMxNjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljZjVhMGMtYjM3ZS00YWFmLWE2NjAtMjJjYjRkMmMxNjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002536/","name":"Emmy Rossum"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060306/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0618680/","name":"Jeffrey Nachmanoff"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Firstly, it was said that this version has sexual over/undertones.\n\nErm... well yes... any accurate portrayal of the story would have, as these subtleties are present en masse in the book, indeed more so in the book than in the film it could be argued. It is precisely this evident descent towards Wendy's loss of innocence that both disturbs and excites adult readers of the books and this is quite intentional.

Indeed the tradition of the same actor playing the role of Mr Darling AND Hook dates back to the story's original appearance as a stage play at the turn of the century and has been carried on on most occasions since then, though I concede that the Disney version (a far less worthy and sterilised version) failed to keep this tradition up.\n\nAs for the point at which the two boys are hung upside down in their nightshirts, I thought it was funny, as did the rest of the audience in the theatre and we certainly weren't there with a red pen counting the number of bottom shots as Mr Ulmer appears to have done. This film is full of charming humour, adult overtones for the adults, childish fantasy and wonderment for those of the appropriate age. The acting is superb in all areas and I must make particular mention of both Ludivine Sagnier as a wickedly funny Tink and of course Rachel Hurd-Wood whose screen debut showed her as a previously undiscovered talent who will surely go far.

The score the movie has received here doesn't do it justice, as it is A movie you won't end up saying that it was A waste of you're time but an effortless pleasant way to pass an hour and A half. The only thing I didn't "dig" about this movie was the casting of Ashley Judd, yes she is pretty and A good actress but she didn't seem fit to play The Rock girlfriend (watch it and you will understand why), well maybe I am wrong or maybe it was the hair style and clothing she wore anyway that was the only casting I would change.

Still who knows where Ben Stiller will be going next.\n\nIn this one Stiller learns that the ancient Egyptian tablet that's causing the exhibits to come to life is running out of juice, it needs exposure to the moonlight every so often for a recharge.

So much that we won't forget certain instances when the other person (perpetrator) might have already forgotten about them. Something that is big thing in this movie. The bigger thing is though, the inability to see the good thing right in front of you sometimes.\n\nAnd so while we do know where this is heading (or running at some point), the main characters need more conviction than that. And also you have to fill the 90 minutes somehow, don't you? It's still pretty decent, if you like your teenage comedy/dramas played out in that sort of romantic fashion.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1362,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-08-28","keywords":"bike accident,male in shower,taking a shower,condom,female rear nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2475408153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmIzYjljZTgtN2E3Mi00ODY1LWI2ZDItNjc4YWZiNWQ5NTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmIzYjljZTgtN2E3Mi00ODY1LWI2ZDItNjc4YWZiNWQ5NTdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3612367/","name":"Merlin Rose","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3582197/","name":"Lisa Vicari","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2001517/","name":"Max von der Groeben"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0678450/","name":"Marco Petry"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0225456/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0381995/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071976/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0678450/","name":"Marco Petry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1410739/","name":"Jan Ehlert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6807223/","name":"Jaromir Konecny"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="de">Spy: Directed by Paul Feig. With Jude Law, Raad Rawi, Melissa McCarthy, Jessica Chaffin. A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt3079380/","name":"Spy","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI5OTQ0MDQxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwNjMyNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt3079380/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"lnvicta"},"dateCreated":"2015-06-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"James Bond, Jane Bond, and Jason Statham - a lethal combo for laughter","reviewBody":"Kingsman: The Secret Service started a beautiful new wave of James Bond satire films. It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.\n\nWhat I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nAs far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.\n\nSpy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is also quite a daring film -- who would have imagined a G-rated, live action comedy these days, and without any fart jokes? Where's Mel Brooks when we need him? Just kidding. \n\nThis movie homage, and I can it can be argued that it is, to the great Tati films of "Mon Oncle" and "Mr. Hulot's Holiday" is Rowan Atkinson's triumphant farewell to the great character he created. It is hard to imagine any other actor living today pulling this off. Indeed, "Vacation" comes very close to being a silent film -- though I want to assure anyone wandering in from a showing of Transformers, that there are explosion. Now over at the well-known movie review site, half the critics are complaining about Mr. Bean's mugging. Half the critics at that site will apparently complain about anything. But when you have a face as brilliantly expressive as Atkinson's, gosh people, you use it. To moan about that, well, it's like going to a Fred Astaire movie and complaining about the dancing.\n\nBut more than that, every scene works, fast or slow, the pacing is perfect. Silly scenes or heartfelt, or both, the comedy never flags. It is one of those movies that long afterward you will be recalling scenes and laughing. The casting is perfect. William Defoe? Yes! There is also a lot of feeling here. I completely bought every one of the characters and their relationships. That is great comic writing.\n\nIt also has one of the best endings of any movies out there. For some reason, contemporary films are having a terribly difficult time with coming up with a satisfactory ending. Not "Mr. Bean's Vacation." It has an astonishingly goofy conclusion, one that Mel Brooks at the top of his form would have had a hard time equaling.\n\nI cannot recommend this movie enough, though I wish it had been longer. Take your family to see it -- it will be a long time before anyone can say that again about a contemporary comedy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120275,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2007-04-04","keywords":"france,train,lost passport,toilet,camera","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000100/","name":"Rowan Atkinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000353/","name":"Willem Dafoe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0671487/","name":"Steve Pemberton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070436/","name":"Steve Bendelack"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0217435/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000100/","name":"Rowan Atkinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564402/","name":"Simon McBurney"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is also quite a daring film -- who would have imagined a G-rated, live action comedy these days, and without any fart jokes? Where's Mel Brooks when we need him? Just kidding. \n\nThis movie homage, and I can it can be argued that it is, to the great Tati films of "Mon Oncle" and "Mr. Hulot's Holiday" is Rowan Atkinson's triumphant farewell to the great character he created. It is hard to imagine any other actor living today pulling this off. Indeed, "Vacation" comes very close to being a silent film -- though I want to assure anyone wandering in from a showing of Transformers, that there are explosion. Now over at the well-known movie review site, half the critics are complaining about Mr. Bean's mugging. Half the critics at that site will apparently complain about anything. But when you have a face as brilliantly expressive as Atkinson's, gosh people, you use it. To moan about that, well, it's like going to a Fred Astaire movie and complaining about the dancing.\n\nBut more than that, every scene works, fast or slow, the pacing is perfect. Silly scenes or heartfelt, or both, the comedy never flags. It is one of those movies that long afterward you will be recalling scenes and laughing. The casting is perfect. William Defoe? Yes! There is also a lot of feeling here. I completely bought every one of the characters and their relationships. That is great comic writing.\n\nIt also has one of the best endings of any movies out there. For some reason, contemporary films are having a terribly difficult time with coming up with a satisfactory ending. Not "Mr. Bean's Vacation." It has an astonishingly goofy conclusion, one that Mel Brooks at the top of his form would have had a hard time equaling.\n\nI cannot recommend this movie enough, though I wish it had been longer. Take your family to see it -- it will be a long time before anyone can say that again about a contemporary comedy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120275,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2007-04-04","keywords":"france,train,lost passport,toilet,camera","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000100/","name":"Rowan Atkinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000353/","name":"Willem Dafoe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0671487/","name":"Steve Pemberton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070436/","name":"Steve Bendelack"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0217435/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000100/","name":"Rowan Atkinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564402/","name":"Simon McBurney"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Ben (Rogen) is a layabout bum who lives with his stoner friends, "working" on a celebrity porn movie website. Alison (Heigl) has just been promoted at E!, and when she heads out to celebrate, their worlds collide with disastrous and of course hilarious consequences.\n\nThe comedy is clever and insightful, loaded with little self-referential moments and pop culture references (the Munich one is particularly awesome), and while it occasionally veers toward the puerile, the movie's subject matter ensures that the humour remains considered and intelligent for the most part. The performances are outstanding, but not just in terms of comic timing. Rogen appears built for this sort of balanced role as he realises that he has to grow up to meet the challenges of relationships and parenthood, and Heigl is just as effective as she learns to accommodate Ben's lifestyle and releases her grip on her career. The support from Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann is also brilliant. While their conflict-ridden marriage doesn't make them the greatest of role models for Ben and Alison, it certainly provides lots of laughs, and the clashes between Mann's overly paranoid Debbie and Rudd's laid-back Pete provide an interesting projection of how Ben &amp; Alison's relationship could turn out.\n\nThe Rudd &amp; Rogen moments make for some of the movie's better lines, but their humour is finely balanced with that emotional depth that I mentioned before, making the characters far more than punchline machines, which benefits the movie immeasurably. The awkward intimacy of Ben &amp; Alison's almost-forced relationship also provides touching and comic moments, as Apatow examines what happens "when life doesn't care about your plan". Even the serious, emotional scenes are laced with a sort of ironic, bittersweet humour, which again gives the characters a sense of realism but also makes the movie that bit more comfortable and reassuring.\n\nA subject that could have been treated with a crass touch, Apatow remains in tune with his previous effort, The 40 Year Old Virgin, and chooses to focus on the impact the pregnancy has on the lives of the characters, allowing their actions and interactions to create the comedy as they come to terms with their new situation.

Mark Wahlberg is perfect.","reviewBody":"Just when you think, "If you've seen one Will Ferrell movie, you've seen them all," think again. Ferrell is back and totally redeems himself from the flop that was Land of the Lost by giving one of his most genius performances to date. \n\nIt does help that Ferrell is partnered with hottie Mark Wahlberg who delivers a superbly-angst-ridden-yet-hilariously-gut-ripping performance. The movie is filled with fresh, sarcastic, and humorous one-liners, non-stop laughter, plenty of action, car chases, and explosions, and a complex plot with a thought-provoking political message. Just make sure you stay through the credits.\n\nI cant't remember the last time I laughed out this loud and this often in a movie theater.

Ferrell is back and totally redeems himself from the flop that was Land of the Lost by giving one of his most genius performances to date. \n\nIt does help that Ferrell is partnered with hottie Mark Wahlberg who delivers a superbly-angst-ridden-yet-hilariously-gut-ripping performance. The movie is filled with fresh, sarcastic, and humorous one-liners, non-stop laughter, plenty of action, car chases, and explosions, and a complex plot with a thought-provoking political message. Just make sure you stay through the credits.\n\nI cant't remember the last time I laughed out this loud and this often in a movie theater. One early particular scene in the movie in which Ferrell and Wahlberg argue over whether a lion or a tuna would win in a fight is so well acted and delivered that I was left gasping for air after laughing so hard.

Firstly, I really enjoyed John Michael McDonagh's Calvary with Brendan Gleeson, both written and directed by McDonagh, just like this film. Secondly, Michael Peña being one of my favourite actors since the film Crash and have liked him in everything since. Thirdly, this year's Tarzan, Alexander Skarsgård, having enjoyed his John Clayton/Tarzan I was eager to see what else he can offer. \n\nPeña and Skargård play Bob and Terry, two corrupt cops who wreck havoc across New Mexico taking and doing whatever they want under the protection of their badge and guns, roughing up criminals in their unorthodox policing methods, who are unfortunately enough to get in their way. Skargård's Terry being the hulking, unhinged, drunkard that swaggers about punching most people in the face; a lot, and Peña's Bob is the intellect of the two, smart-talking and quick-thinking being his forte, throwing out quirky philosophical comments at any given moment. The chemistry between the two is highly entertaining, provoking you to want to know what they're going to do next. \n\nThe two of them rampage about town in Terry's indestructible 1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo and no one is safe, apart from the meek, so justice is on the agenda, just not the kind of justice the precinct would warrant, especially their Lieutenant, played by Paul Reiser. Their shake downs of crims eventually leads them to smug, rich Brit, crime-Lord James Mangan, who is just wrong, very wrong indeed but played well by Divergent's Theo James, donning his home accent and wonderful tweed attire. \n\nThe film goes all over the place, (even to Iceland) and although not hard to follow, it feels like a mess, thinking I had missed something along the way. A lot happens in the 98min runtime but I can't say it's fast pace, it felt unbalanced quite a few times during the movie but the events that do unfold are dark and brutal if not amusing. \n\nThere's quite an assortment of characters besides the key players, notably the absconding informant, Reggie, the squirmy, feminine Birdwell, Paddy Power, Pádraic and the stunning Jackie Hollis, played by Creed's Tessa Thompson. With all the colourful characters it made the story feel like a disjointed, poor version of a Tarantino movie but and lacked a great soundtrack, apart from the Glen Campbell that seems to be playing most of the time during the film. \n\nIt's a rough, tough buddy-cop movie like no other, could well have been written by Elmore Leonard whilst on LSD.

Events, however, are complicated by the arrival of someone who appears to be even more dangerous than they are.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt3708886/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"SpoilerAlertReviews","dateCreated":"2016-09-21","inLanguage":"English","name":"Could have been better but still enjoyable.","reviewBody":"This week's Odeon's Screen Unseen was my highly anticipated War On Everyone, highly anticipated for a number of reasons. Firstly, I really enjoyed John Michael McDonagh's Calvary with Brendan Gleeson, both written and directed by McDonagh, just like this film. Secondly, Michael Peña being one of my favourite actors since the film Crash and have liked him in everything since. Thirdly, this year's Tarzan, Alexander Skarsgård, having enjoyed his John Clayton/Tarzan I was eager to see what else he can offer. \n\nPeña and Skargård play Bob and Terry, two corrupt cops who wreck havoc across New Mexico taking and doing whatever they want under the protection of their badge and guns, roughing up criminals in their unorthodox policing methods, who are unfortunately enough to get in their way. Skargård's Terry being the hulking, unhinged, drunkard that swaggers about punching most people in the face; a lot, and Peña's Bob is the intellect of the two, smart-talking and quick-thinking being his forte, throwing out quirky philosophical comments at any given moment. The chemistry between the two is highly entertaining, provoking you to want to know what they're going to do next. \n\nThe two of them rampage about town in Terry's indestructible 1970 Chevrolet Monte Carlo and no one is safe, apart from the meek, so justice is on the agenda, just not the kind of justice the precinct would warrant, especially their Lieutenant, played by Paul Reiser. Their shake downs of crims eventually leads them to smug, rich Brit, crime-Lord James Mangan, who is just wrong, very wrong indeed but played well by Divergent's Theo James, donning his home accent and wonderful tweed attire. \n\nThe film goes all over the place, (even to Iceland) and although not hard to follow, it feels like a mess, thinking I had missed something along the way. A lot happens in the 98min runtime but I can't say it's fast pace, it felt unbalanced quite a few times during the movie but the events that do unfold are dark and brutal if not amusing. \n\nThere's quite an assortment of characters besides the key players, notably the absconding informant, Reggie, the squirmy, feminine Birdwell, Paddy Power, Pádraic and the stunning Jackie Hollis, played by Creed's Tessa Thompson. With all the colourful characters it made the story feel like a disjointed, poor version of a Tarantino movie but and lacked a great soundtrack, apart from the Glen Campbell that seems to be playing most of the time during the film. \n\nIt's a rough, tough buddy-cop movie like no other, could well have been written by Elmore Leonard whilst on LSD. It's very much a McDonagh's movie, being quite refreshing in effortless style, only Americanised and yet, there's great potential to improve on this film. \n\nRunning Time: 7 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 7 Story: 5 Script: 8 Creativity: 6 Soundtrack: 6 Job Description: 6 The Extra Bonus Points: 5 for being quite outrageous and offensive in parts. \n\n66% 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":17809,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2016-10-07","keywords":"hare krishna,dirty cop,corrupt police,albuquerque new mexico,police detective","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1613936153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNzU2OTQyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE4NDE5MDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNzU2OTQyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE4NDE5MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Two corrupt cops in New Mexico set out to blackmail and frame every criminal unfortunate enough to cross their path.

Whatever I expected this to be, it turned out far better. Adam Brody gave an amazing performance, somewhat similar to a live action BoJack Horseman in this movie (obviously with detectives instead of actors). The comedy is really good too, the film knows how to make the audience laugh and when it's appropriate to do so. Not every line is hilarious, but a majority of the jokes tend to land. A sign of a good movie is, despite however much comedy it is, it's plot is well thought out, unpredictable, and possibly one of the most well done mysteries I've seen. It fits perfectly with the tone, plot, and characters. And the ending! The ending! Something so different from the rest of the movie, but something that works so well with it! When the film wraps, it leaves you wanting nothing but for Abe Applebaum's next mystery.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-10-16","keywords":"voice over narration,private detective,small town,african american policeman,camera shot from inside a closet","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Kid Detective [Trailer]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3983655193","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMWU2NDItNjAzZS00NGMzLWIzODUtNGM0YWY3ZGYwMDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMWU2NDItNjAzZS00NGMzLWIzODUtNGM0YWY3ZGYwMDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A once-celebrated kid detective (Adam Brody), now 31, continues to solve the same trivial mysteries between hangovers and bouts of self-pity.

Whatever I expected this to be, it turned out far better. Adam Brody gave an amazing performance, somewhat similar to a live action BoJack Horseman in this movie (obviously with detectives instead of actors). The comedy is really good too, the film knows how to make the audience laugh and when it's appropriate to do so. Not every line is hilarious, but a majority of the jokes tend to land. A sign of a good movie is, despite however much comedy it is, it's plot is well thought out, unpredictable, and possibly one of the most well done mysteries I've seen. It fits perfectly with the tone, plot, and characters. And the ending! The ending! Something so different from the rest of the movie, but something that works so well with it! When the film wraps, it leaves you wanting nothing but for Abe Applebaum's next mystery.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-10-16","keywords":"voice over narration,private detective,small town,african american policeman,camera shot from inside a closet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Kid Detective [Trailer]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3983655193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMWU2NDItNjAzZS00NGMzLWIzODUtNGM0YWY3ZGYwMDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMWU2NDItNjAzZS00NGMzLWIzODUtNGM0YWY3ZGYwMDg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A once-celebrated kid detective (Adam Brody), now 31, continues to solve the same trivial mysteries between hangovers and bouts of self-pity.

We see the development of film posters as advertising to sell movies. It was not regarded as art. We see the work of notable poster artists of the recent times. John Alvin, Richard Amsel, Drew Struzan. People who worked on Jaws, Star Wars, ET, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Blade Runner, Alien.\n\nIn the 1990s, the art of the film posters declined. We got floating heads lit in various ways. The film posters showed you the stars of the film, such as Face/off. Horror movies were no different. Exhibitors, video shops wanted the faces of the stars. Even if a director wanted some fancy art work he would discover that power ultimately lay with the film executives and they all went for something identical.\n\nThe second half of the film was about money.

We got floating heads lit in various ways. The film posters showed you the stars of the film, such as Face/off. Horror movies were no different. Exhibitors, video shops wanted the faces of the stars. Even if a director wanted some fancy art work he would discover that power ultimately lay with the film executives and they all went for something identical.\n\nThe second half of the film was about money.

I've read the comics (mostly the Ultimate comics, but some of the 60's comics as well), played some of the video games, and watched the cartoons (The 1994 and 2008 series being some of my favorite animated shows of all time).\n\nI enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (yes, even Spider-Man 3). When I heard that the series was being rebooted, I wasn't happy to hear about it. My expectations were neutral as time went by and when I walked out the theater, my expectations were blown away.\n\nI don't want to compare this movie to the original trilogy, but I think it's necessary to see where this movie improved from the originals.\n\nLet's start with the casting. Andrew Garfield is a great successor to Tobey Maguire. I can really relate to him like I always do with other incarnations of the web slinger. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is even better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Gwen is a much stronger character and the chemistry between her and Garfield as Peter Parker is believable. Rhys Ifans is great as Doctor Connors (a.k.a. The Lizard) and I like how he is a "Jekyll and Hyde"-type of villain (kind of like a few other villains... yeah). Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively, are also great as well. All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.\n\nThe visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.\n\nThe musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.\n\nIf I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.\n\nOverall, "The Amazing Spider-Man" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":579984,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2012-07-05","keywords":"death of parents,teenage protagonist,aunt nephew relationship,spider man character,spider","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi717595161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the four-minute trailer for The Amazing-Spider Man."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1989536/","name":"Marc Webb"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460141/","name":"Steve Kloves"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.\n\nThe visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.\n\nThe musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.\n\nIf I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.\n\nOverall, "The Amazing Spider-Man" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":579984,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2012-07-05","keywords":"death of parents,teenage protagonist,aunt nephew relationship,spider man character,spider","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi717595161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the four-minute trailer for The Amazing-Spider Man.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1989536/","name":"Marc Webb"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460141/","name":"Steve Kloves"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The retro design is suave and making this a period piece gives it a cool and unique flavor. The collaboration between Singer and Vaughn apparently was a perfect blend.

(Not easy to do) The dramatic and violent story was amazingly well balanced with the comedy and one-liners. The violence was not half as bad as I expected (although the one with the guillotine and the one with the knife through the chin at the end a bit unsettling...) And I appreciated being spared explicit lovescenes or a corny romance between Frank and Joan. Even the swearing was piped down considerably.\n\nOf course, this is not Oscar material, but the acting was satisfying, and the story not bad at all.

I don't read comics, and therefore knows nothing of the comicbook hero, The Punisher/Frank Castle. I didn't expect much, same as I wouldn't (and didn't) of movies like Batman, Catwoman, or The Hulk.\n\nI was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I was actually impressed! (Not easy to do) The dramatic and violent story was amazingly well balanced with the comedy and one-liners. The violence was not half as bad as I expected (although the one with the guillotine and the one with the knife through the chin at the end a bit unsettling...) And I appreciated being spared explicit lovescenes or a corny romance between Frank and Joan. Even the swearing was piped down considerably.\n\nOf course, this is not Oscar material, but the acting was satisfying, and the story not bad at all. One to enjoy...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":154310,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2004-05-05","keywords":"vigilante,revenge,family reunion,female nudity,origin of hero","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Punisher (2004)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4236444185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg1ZWIyNGQtMjdkNy00YjkzLWE3MDEtZWM0YjYxM2VlMmFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg1ZWIyNGQtMjdkNy00YjkzLWE3MDEtZWM0YjYxM2VlMmFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this film based on the Marvel comic book character","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005048/","name":"Thomas Jane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000526/","name":"Samantha Mathis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378144/","name":"Jonathan Hensleigh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060306/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092570/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378144/","name":"Jonathan Hensleigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0289833/","name":"Michael France"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This helps the film because really this is not something that tries to have something for everyone so much as it is a film that knows the target audience and is determined to give them what they want. As a result, the story here is a simple affair of a criminal scarred by the Punisher, going out for revenge while the police are after both of them  it is not the most complex bit of writing you'll ever see but then, it doesn't need to be. Those looking for the Punisher's dark tone to be utilised to try and make this character into a possible "Batman" in regards having a dark psyche at the core of it will be disappointed because the film does no such thing. I was one of these people though and I was at least hoping that more would be made of the rage and loss inside Castle  but again, a few flashbacks aside, he generally just broods around the place full of vengeful justice.\n\nWhat carries the film then is a series of brutal action sequences and effects shots, all full of callous violence, macho posturing and gun play that rewrites all rules of the real world. At this point it does depend what you are looking for because there are a core of viewers will love the film for this as it delivers exploded head after collapsing face after dismembering and other really graphic acts. For me personally the overdose on excess is all too much and it does leave the film with this very unpleasant air that makes it harder to enjoy. If the violence was a little less graphic or frequently graphic then it would have been easier to actually "enjoy" the big action sequences for what they were, rather than the gore putting me off  although again for some this will be the cherry on the cake. To the casual viewer this excess does give the film an exploitative, careless edge, where all the characters are little more than things waiting to explode and it limits how much we care  not just about the goons but also the main characters.\n\nThis further detracts from the dark character of Castle as he becomes just a machine and not a man or even a shadow of a man  and no, staring off moodily into the distance every now and again is not the same thing. At the same time it also limits the more flamboyant and silly side of the film  the side that the hammy Jigsaw needed to play up. You can see it in the excess but also in the Patton reference and other silly things; all of these imply that it should be a little bit camp with the darkness (hence making it a bit more fun and accessible) but it doesn't do this and those that play to this side of it are left just looking silly in a bad way rather than a good way.\n\nSpecifically West suffers from this as his comic book villain is lost in the sea of gore. As a Wire fan I do feel a bit for West but his Italian impersonation at the start is awful and, once behind the make-up he can do little but be "a bad man" without much unique about him to make him notable for anything other than what he has done before. Stevenson is not "good" either but he matches the ambition of the film and makes for a big dark presence  which is all the material needs and this he does well. I quite liked Salmon in it because he is one of the few that feels natural  which is a bit of a condemnation on everyone else when you think about Salmon's range generally. Hutchinson matches West by overplaying but again the sense of comic book madness is taken away by the gore.\n\nPunisher War Zone is a basic genre film then. For target audience it will satisfy as it delivers simple characters with simple motivations, a straight-forward plot with lots of action and lots of gore  boxes ticked. However for many casual viewers it will be all too dark and unpleasant as the gore dominates and it makes everything seem a bit less "entertaining" and a lot more like work. The dark tone to the character and the hammy silliness of the villains are lost and the entire film appears to be about exploding heads  great if that is your thing but not so great if not.

Overall this film is a misguided attempt at a Hulk film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258875,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2003-06-20","keywords":"radiation,monster,scientist,general,technology","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hulk","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1139409177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQyNGIxMzctM2NkYy00ZWY4LWIwN2MtYzJmNDQ3MDJiNmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQyNGIxMzctM2NkYy00ZWY4LWIwN2MtYzJmNDQ3MDJiNmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0051509/","name":"Eric Bana","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000124/","name":"Jennifer Connelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092570/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456158/","name":"Jack Kirby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"],"duration":"PT2H18M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But it wasn't so bad either; it's just that after Marvel Comics' recent domination of the film genre, it's natural for one to expect that each of its characters having a shot at the big screen would present something legitimately entertaining to the audience. Something the first installment failed and the second struggled to achieve.\n\nIn "Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer," the four superheroes are back once again to help everyone solve their gamut of problems. Reed Richards aka Mr. Fantastic (Ioan Gruffudd) is about to wed Susan Storm aka Invisible Woman (Jessica Alba).

I like Nicolas Cage and that is why I went to see this movie.\n\nThe movie is about a magician Cris Johnson (Cage) who can see his own future for only 2 minutes ahead. The FBI Officer (Julianne Moore) is behind him to seek his help to uncover a nuclear weapon post in LA; the terrorist group is after him because they too want to be ahead of FBI with the help of Cage, but Cage does not want to help anyone and is on a run and his purpose is to seek a girl (Jessica Biel) whose future he can see for a longer period. The movie is about how Cage gets involved in helping FBI  only to realize in the end that he is able to save his girl friend instead of saving 8 million population of LA. The last scene of the movie (that I will not tell now and spoil the show) kept me unsatisfied with the movie.\n\nNicolas Cage has produced the movie himself. Lee Tamahori (Sopranos, Die Another Day, Along came a Spider fame) has directed the movie. The movie is based on a novel called "Golden Man".\n\nEven though the story is old, the format of telling it, is new. From the first scene the director without wasting any time tells you that Cage can see his future and then takes you into unwinding of action, and never let go the pace of the movie. The movie has lots of twists and turns; mostly predictable  once we know that hero can see the future; but still maintains interest throughout.\n\nNicolas Cage looks a bit haggard but has acted well. Juliaane Moore and beautiful Jessica Biel have nothing extra-ordinary to do and their characters help the movie go forward. The movie has some good actions scenes and few funny moments. Funny moments because the Director allows the audience to see all the options Cage can think and see in future  and then chooses one that best suiting him.\n\nI am having this feeling that Nicolas Cage is trying to re-invent himself in a much remembered screen character that can give him at least a few more innings as sequels. His choosing Ghost Rider and now this character of Next  both have tremendous scope for sequels like James Bond, Spiderman, Superman, Die Hard, etc. Sadly with box office not ticking the counters strongly  the hope of Cage does not seem to being materializing soon.\n\n(Stars 6 out of 10)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153648,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-05-30","keywords":"woman in jeopardy,tape over mouth,7 eleven store,time traveler,fowards time travel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Next","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1083769113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhjNjBlYWItMTFlNy00MzQzLTk1MGQtNTI4M2M5MGM4YTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhjNjBlYWItMTFlNy00MzQzLTk1MGQtNTI4M2M5MGM4YTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004754/","name":"Jessica Biel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848414/","name":"Lee Tamahori"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011877/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0325778/","name":"Gary Goldman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378144/","name":"Jonathan Hensleigh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0076602/","name":"Paul Bernbaum"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I like Nicolas Cage and that is why I went to see this movie.\n\nThe movie is about a magician Cris Johnson (Cage) who can see his own future for only 2 minutes ahead. The FBI Officer (Julianne Moore) is behind him to seek his help to uncover a nuclear weapon post in LA; the terrorist group is after him because they too want to be ahead of FBI with the help of Cage, but Cage does not want to help anyone and is on a run and his purpose is to seek a girl (Jessica Biel) whose future he can see for a longer period. The movie is about how Cage gets involved in helping FBI  only to realize in the end that he is able to save his girl friend instead of saving 8 million population of LA. The last scene of the movie (that I will not tell now and spoil the show) kept me unsatisfied with the movie.\n\nNicolas Cage has produced the movie himself. Lee Tamahori (Sopranos, Die Another Day, Along came a Spider fame) has directed the movie. The movie is based on a novel called "Golden Man".\n\nEven though the story is old, the format of telling it, is new. From the first scene the director without wasting any time tells you that Cage can see his future and then takes you into unwinding of action, and never let go the pace of the movie. The movie has lots of twists and turns; mostly predictable  once we know that hero can see the future; but still maintains interest throughout.\n\nNicolas Cage looks a bit haggard but has acted well. Juliaane Moore and beautiful Jessica Biel have nothing extra-ordinary to do and their characters help the movie go forward. The movie has some good actions scenes and few funny moments. Funny moments because the Director allows the audience to see all the options Cage can think and see in future  and then chooses one that best suiting him.\n\nI am having this feeling that Nicolas Cage is trying to re-invent himself in a much remembered screen character that can give him at least a few more innings as sequels. His choosing Ghost Rider and now this character of Next  both have tremendous scope for sequels like James Bond, Spiderman, Superman, Die Hard, etc. Sadly with box office not ticking the counters strongly  the hope of Cage does not seem to being materializing soon.\n\n(Stars 6 out of 10)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153648,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-05-30","keywords":"woman in jeopardy,tape over mouth,7 eleven store,time traveler,fowards time travel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Next","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1083769113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhjNjBlYWItMTFlNy00MzQzLTk1MGQtNTI4M2M5MGM4YTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhjNjBlYWItMTFlNy00MzQzLTk1MGQtNTI4M2M5MGM4YTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004754/","name":"Jessica Biel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848414/","name":"Lee Tamahori"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011877/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0325778/","name":"Gary Goldman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378144/","name":"Jonathan Hensleigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0076602/","name":"Paul Bernbaum"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. \n\nSandra Oh stands out for her comic timing, but the entire cast is superb. It's not as grave as ER, but is just as compelling. Also, it's a little more accessible than ER and some of the more serious medical dramas. The show is definitely worth catching--if you can't watch it when it airs, TiVo it or rent the first season DVD. It's well worth the time spent! It's great for marathon viewings!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":270305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

How in the world can three quarters of the main cast be just nixed like that? Something more than people just "moving on" to better things is going on, I think.\n\nYeah, Reuben's character can be written off easily based on the season one finale, but dropping Machado and McDermott like lead balloons is very sketchy. Even the storyline for Reuben was a stretch since there was a sub-plot pertaining to her personal life (ie. Rick Fox guest-starring) that was developing.\n\nI enjoyed season one immensely because the acting was believable, the chemistry was there, and the writing/directing was top-notch. I'll give season two a chance with new-comers Vivica A. Fox and the rest, but when there are major changes to an already quality cast, usually it's not for the better. We shall see.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1291,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2003-08-02","keywords":"fbi federal bureau of investigation,female protagonist,scene before opening credits,law enforcement,vision","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0778741/","name":"Caterina Scorsone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000407/","name":"Vivica A.

Some, such as Copycat and Insomnia, offer a surprisingly good time; but more often than not, these films are a lot more like Murder by Numbers and The Bone Collector, and unfortunately; Taking Lives is like the latter. That being said, the film certainly isn't all bad; and definitely does have its moments. The plot has little regard for consistency or logic, as it constantly switches gears and throws in any number of events that are clearly there for dramatic effect and haven't been thought out properly. The film is an obvious derivative of successful nineties thriller, 'Seven' and some scenes, such as the entry into the murderer's home have been taken wholesale from the superior movie. The plot has a lot of elements, but we principally follow FBI agent Illeana Scott as she travels to Montreal in order to help their police force with a case that involves a serial killer who, not content to simply murder his victims, takes their identity and lives their lives for a period before moving onto his next victim.\n\nThe cinematography is dark and glossy, and sleazy settings mean that it's always a lot like Fincher's earlier flick. The pace of the film is poorly paced, as sometimes it's fast and furious, while at other times it's very dull.

Some, such as Copycat and Insomnia, offer a surprisingly good time; but more often than not, these films are a lot more like Murder by Numbers and The Bone Collector, and unfortunately; Taking Lives is like the latter. That being said, the film certainly isn't all bad; and definitely does have its moments. The plot has little regard for consistency or logic, as it constantly switches gears and throws in any number of events that are clearly there for dramatic effect and haven't been thought out properly. The film is an obvious derivative of successful nineties thriller, 'Seven' and some scenes, such as the entry into the murderer's home have been taken wholesale from the superior movie. The plot has a lot of elements, but we principally follow FBI agent Illeana Scott as she travels to Montreal in order to help their police force with a case that involves a serial killer who, not content to simply murder his victims, takes their identity and lives their lives for a period before moving onto his next victim.\n\nThe cinematography is dark and glossy, and sleazy settings mean that it's always a lot like Fincher's earlier flick. The pace of the film is poorly paced, as sometimes it's fast and furious, while at other times it's very dull. At almost an hour and fifty minutes, the film is too long; and a better editing job is definitely in order. The final half hour is of particular note for being poorly judged. It's far too slow, and means that rather than being memorable; the conclusion is tepid and disorientated. The first twist can be seen coming a mile off, and the way that it is revealed disregards logic for dramatic effect. The final twist doesn't work well either, as everything is far too convenient.

How in the world can three quarters of the main cast be just nixed like that? Something more than people just "moving on" to better things is going on, I think.\n\nYeah, Reuben's character can be written off easily based on the season one finale, but dropping Machado and McDermott like lead balloons is very sketchy. Even the storyline for Reuben was a stretch since there was a sub-plot pertaining to her personal life (ie. Rick Fox guest-starring) that was developing.\n\nI enjoyed season one immensely because the acting was believable, the chemistry was there, and the writing/directing was top-notch. I'll give season two a chance with new-comers Vivica A. Fox and the rest, but when there are major changes to an already quality cast, usually it's not for the better. We shall see.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1291,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2003-08-02","keywords":"fbi federal bureau of investigation,female protagonist,scene before opening credits,law enforcement,vision","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0778741/","name":"Caterina Scorsone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000407/","name":"Vivica A.

Some, such as Copycat and Insomnia, offer a surprisingly good time; but more often than not, these films are a lot more like Murder by Numbers and The Bone Collector, and unfortunately; Taking Lives is like the latter. That being said, the film certainly isn't all bad; and definitely does have its moments. The plot has little regard for consistency or logic, as it constantly switches gears and throws in any number of events that are clearly there for dramatic effect and haven't been thought out properly. The film is an obvious derivative of successful nineties thriller, 'Seven' and some scenes, such as the entry into the murderer's home have been taken wholesale from the superior movie. The plot has a lot of elements, but we principally follow FBI agent Illeana Scott as she travels to Montreal in order to help their police force with a case that involves a serial killer who, not content to simply murder his victims, takes their identity and lives their lives for a period before moving onto his next victim.\n\nThe cinematography is dark and glossy, and sleazy settings mean that it's always a lot like Fincher's earlier flick. The pace of the film is poorly paced, as sometimes it's fast and furious, while at other times it's very dull. At almost an hour and fifty minutes, the film is too long; and a better editing job is definitely in order. The final half hour is of particular note for being poorly judged. It's far too slow, and means that rather than being memorable; the conclusion is tepid and disorientated. The first twist can be seen coming a mile off, and the way that it is revealed disregards logic for dramatic effect. The final twist doesn't work well either, as everything is far too convenient. It seems that in their effort to outdo all the other films in its class, the writers have forgotten that for dramatic effect to work, it needs to make sense. The acting is good enough, and it's obvious why the dark and mysterious Angelina Jolie was cast in the lead. Ethan Hawke, who I seem to like more every time I see him, is good; while Kiefer Sutherland is given nothing at all to do. On the whole, this is worth a watch if you've got nothing better to do; but there are better films that are like 'Taking Lives', than Taking Lives.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86291,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-04-28","keywords":"serial killer,female agent,fake identity,criminal investigation,canada","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Taking Lives","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi92799257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJlZTI3NzktMDgzZS00Nzk1LWFlODMtNjc5ODUxMjBmYmIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGJlZTI3NzktMDgzZS00Nzk1LWFlODMtNjc5ODUxMjBmYmIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001401/","name":"Angelina Jolie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000662/","name":"Kiefer Sutherland"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0142286/","name":"D.J.

I was drawn in immediately by the suspense and wondering what was going to happen next.\n\nI can definitely say this one is one on my must watch list. Lots of twists and turns as you go along that keep you interested and wanting to see more. The other characters all do a great job as well.
