This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started.

Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential.

If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the "Most Wanted" episode. That episode was the Pilot for "FBI: Most Wanted" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there.

Many may say that this is a 'rip-off' of CSI but I've watched CSI and it caught me on for a bit, but after a while it just seemed to closed. Where CSI guides you through the story and gives a picture perfect ending and how you're supposed to perceive it, Criminal Minds lets you explore and judge for yourself. It doesn't preach too much and the stories are engaging and suspenseful! Excellent writing and great performances from the stars. It may begin cliché, but if you stay long enough it is a rewarding and entertaining view, and I don't feel it's going to let down any time soon. Give it a chance, or just watch episode 7 'The Fox'. It shows the best writing and acting in the show so far, in my opinion. Diving into minds of lunatics and psychopaths has never been more entertaining!

Many may say that this is a 'rip-off' of CSI but I've watched CSI and it caught me on for a bit, but after a while it just seemed to closed. Where CSI guides you through the story and gives a picture perfect ending and how you're supposed to perceive it, Criminal Minds lets you explore and judge for yourself. It doesn't preach too much and the stories are engaging and suspenseful! Excellent writing and great performances from the stars. It may begin cliché, but if you stay long enough it is a rewarding and entertaining view, and I don't feel it's going to let down any time soon. Give it a chance, or just watch episode 7 'The Fox'. It shows the best writing and acting in the show so far, in my opinion. Diving into minds of lunatics and psychopaths has never been more entertaining! Fantastic!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":175773,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy.

If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the "Most Wanted" episode. That episode was the Pilot for "FBI: Most Wanted" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there. Now give them the surrounding plots and characters that made S1 so good CBS. Put S1 on All Access too while you're at it!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12189,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the "Most Wanted" episode. That episode was the Pilot for "FBI: Most Wanted" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there. Now give them the surrounding plots and characters that made S1 so good CBS. Put S1 on All Access too while you're at it!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12189,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

We joined a couple of dozen other viewers, socially distanced and masked up. I can't help wondering how the theaters are going to be able to turn a profit with this new normal.\n\nThis lovely film is a great starring vehicle for Gemma Arterton, who's become one of my favorites. Still in her mid-30's she's moved on from playing young attractive add-ons in fantasy films (Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia, or the crazy splashy fun of Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters) and has built a growing and varied record in films playing lead roles in smaller-scale personal dramas like Tamara Drewe, Gemma Bovary, Vita and Virginia, Their Finest, a great Saint Joan at the London National Theatre, and more. Can't wait to see her in the upcoming King's Man.\n\nIn Summerland she plays Alice Lamb, a prickly and reclusive writer who (during WWII) is researching the mirage-like atmospheric phenomenon called the "Fata Morgana". To her surprise and much against her will she is saddled with looking after young schoolboy Frank (Lucas Bond) who, like many other wartime children, has been sent out of London to the provinces to stay safely out of the Blitz. Frank is a basically good-natured kid who's not put off by this apparently crusty "old lady", and the main arch of the plot follows their developing relationship into one of mutual love. Flashbacks to Alice's pre-war association with friend (and more than friend) Vera (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) are shown that fill in much of what we need to know about Alice. In the meantime, Frank strikes up a close friendship with a classmate Edie (Dixie Egerickx) as they follow their natural kids' imperatives to explore everywhere around their little town and seaside.\n\nThose are just the basics, but the last third of the film goes beyond what I just said into more unexpected territory. Two or three major twists are coming, at least one of which is sort of predictable but at least one of which is certainly a surprise. But viewed from the end of the film looking backward, it makes sense. There's no cheating and nothing arbitrary. It's a much more complex story that it at first appears, it's well structured, and (especially) it's nicely paced. The scenery (the white cliffs and windswept meadows of Dover) has a role to play too, but it doesn't intrude on the story. No spoilers -- just go and see it to experience what I mean!\n\nThe two kids (Frank, Edie) are great: they're more than just placeholders filling in the gaps between the adult interactions in the story. Tom Courtenay makes a supporting appearance as an endearing, kindly schoolmaster. But this is Gemma Arterton's movie, make no mistake. She's grown into a masterful actress who (like all her recent parts) disappears so totally into her role that you're not even aware that she's acting. She has Oscar-level skill. But without getting involved in big-budget big-publicity roles I'm not sure she will ever get one. Nevertheless, what she's giving us is art at a high level all the same. The Brits seem so expert at crafting these types of movies -- warm, low-key, compelling personal stories with great casts and a sense of history. We could do a lot worse than get more of them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5222,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"2020-07-31","keywords":"love,lesbian,world war two,evacuee,lesbianism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4123967001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGI5ZGI3NTAtMTA4Ny00MjVhLThiMmYtMTg2M2M5YmZmMjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGI5ZGI3NTAtMTA4Ny00MjVhLThiMmYtMTg2M2M5YmZmMjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"During World War II, an Englishwoman "Gemma Arterton" opens her heart to an evacuee after initially resolving to be rid of him in this moving journey of womanhood, love and friendship.

I had seen previews for this picture, but I'd say this exceeded my expectations, which isn't to say masterpiece, but it was certainly entertaining, and at about 90 minutes, didn't really overstay it's welcome. \n\nAs you might expect for this genre, it's quite gory, so don't go expecting a light 'R' rating. But if you can handle some bloodshed, no, make that a substantial amount of bloodshed - but perhaps I should add in a comic environment - there's some pretty funny stuff here. Woody Harreleson and Jesse Eisenberg make an amusing odd couple and Emma Stone was fine for this material, although she and Abigale Breslin had slightly less to do. \n\nI'm certainly no expert on the horror genre or the zombie sub-genre, but I can say that this wasn't as scary as Shaun of the Dead, in fact not very scary at all, I may have jumped back just a tiny bit a few times; however I may have laughed more. However I'm sure it does make a difference that I saw 'Shaun' alone on DVD, while 'Zombieland' I watched in a theater full of people laughing, clapping and cheering. \n\nLet's face it, you know what's going to happen in this flick, but I'm happy to say, plot conventions and all, this delivers enough laughs so if you know what you're getting into I doubt you'll regret laying down the price of admission for this sucker. Should you see it, see it opening night - if I haven't made it clear enough already, this is the kind of movie where the more enthusiastic people in the theater, the more fun it will be. And to end on a very positive note, 'Zombieland' does feature what just might go down in history as the best celebrity cameo of all time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":540788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2010-01-06","keywords":"zombie,amusement park,twinkie,on the road,actor playing himself","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The "Kick-Ass Girls" of Zombieland","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179635481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTc4Nzc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5MjI5Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTc4Nzc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5MjI5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Zombieland featurette"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0251986/","name":"Jesse Eisenberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281508/","name":"Ruben Fleischer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142539/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1014201/","name":"Rhett Reese"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1116660/","name":"Paul Wernick"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Woody Harreleson and Jesse Eisenberg make an amusing odd couple and Emma Stone was fine for this material, although she and Abigale Breslin had slightly less to do. \n\nI'm certainly no expert on the horror genre or the zombie sub-genre, but I can say that this wasn't as scary as Shaun of the Dead, in fact not very scary at all, I may have jumped back just a tiny bit a few times; however I may have laughed more. However I'm sure it does make a difference that I saw 'Shaun' alone on DVD, while 'Zombieland' I watched in a theater full of people laughing, clapping and cheering. \n\nLet's face it, you know what's going to happen in this flick, but I'm happy to say, plot conventions and all, this delivers enough laughs so if you know what you're getting into I doubt you'll regret laying down the price of admission for this sucker. Should you see it, see it opening night - if I haven't made it clear enough already, this is the kind of movie where the more enthusiastic people in the theater, the more fun it will be. And to end on a very positive note, 'Zombieland' does feature what just might go down in history as the best celebrity cameo of all time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":540788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2010-01-06","keywords":"zombie,amusement park,twinkie,on the road,actor playing himself","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The "Kick-Ass Girls" of Zombieland","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179635481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTc4Nzc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5MjI5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTc4Nzc0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODg5MjI5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Zombieland featurette","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0251986/","name":"Jesse Eisenberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000437/","name":"Woody Harrelson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281508/","name":"Ruben Fleischer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142539/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1014201/","name":"Rhett Reese","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1116660/","name":"Paul Wernick"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

La guerre de Corée éclate le 25 juin 1950 et fait plus de trois millions de victimes. Même après l'armistice de 1953, la guerre froide règne des deux côtés, employant d'innombrables espions. En 1992, les services secrets de Corée du Sud, au courant des travaux du Nord sur une arme nucléaire, tentent d'en savoir plus. Park Seok-young, un ancien officier, est chargé d'infiltrer les membres qui travaillent au programme nucléaire de Corée du Nord.</desc>

An air of anomie suffuses the movie, which tends to make it less compelling to me, but there's little doubt that director Daniel Alfredson accomplishes what he set out to do, which is to involve the audience by making them fill in the unspoken and unshown details.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":367,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-10-10","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"INTRIGO: DEAR AGNES Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi931380761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQ0MTYyNzctOGYyMC00YTljLTg1YmUtOTkyYWQ3YTY0MWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGQ0MTYyNzctOGYyMC00YTljLTg1YmUtOTkyYWQ3YTY0MWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3231562/","name":"Carla Juri","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2110418/","name":"Gemma Chan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0803397/","name":"Jamie Sives"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019242/","name":"Daniel Alfredson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0582057/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305542/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0812653/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0626505/","name":"Håkan Nesser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019242/","name":"Daniel Alfredson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0094455/","name":"Birgitta Bongenhielm"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Di Gregorio, who is also the author of the screenplay and plays one of the lead roles, has created a story that seems to belong, like its heroes, to another era - an era in which people were not only more decent, but also able to plan. to travel or even settle in another country, to be, as the English title of the film says - 'Citizens of the World'.\n\n The heroes of the film are three Italian retirees who have lived most or perhaps their entire lives in Rome or around this city. All three are lonely, their pensions, if they have them, are close to the minimum, they hardly meet ends and their knowledge about the rest of the world and even about the laws of the country and society in which they live is very limited. Corona is still just a brand of beer that the three have probably not heard of, so Europe and the whole world is open to them, and theoretically they could move to another country, somewhere where their precarious pensions in Italy are worth a lot so that their lives would be much more comfortable. Within a week we will watch the three heroes debating with each other and with themselves the idea of leaving the country they had lived in until then and the familiar environment in which they had lived all their lives to embark on the adventure of relocating to another country at old age. The mirage is strong but venturing into the unknown is not an easy decision.\n\n The film has an indisputable charm due primarily to the warmth with which the director films the environment in which their heroes live their lives. The three retirees live in a world that tells them almost bluntly that they are no longer needed, the laws and the ways the capitalist economy and digital society function are increasingly hard to understand to them, but at least some of the people around have not changed much for the worse and the fabric of social relations added to the familiarity of the landscape with its bars, restaurants, market booths, even their neglected homes function as the best social safety net. The three actors, Ennio Fantastichini, Giorgio Colangeli, and film director Gianni Di Gregorio play with talent and empathy the roles of the three heroes, with their doubts and hard to take decisions, with their old age and their difficulties, dreams and disappointments. They are in fact the generation of children in the neo-realistic Italian films of the '50s and' 60s who have now reached the age of old age and are facing what Italy has become tourist and consumer. Based largely on the charm of the actors and the empathy between the audience, the characters and the world in which they live, the film does not develop, unfortunately more intrigue, and therefore the demonstration seems a bit simplistic and rhetorical and at the end of the week described in the film, we, spectators, risk being a little disappointed. 'Lontano Lontano' is a nice and human film, which could have been a very good one if it had been more daring.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":442,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-02-20","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2657337113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg4ZjczMmYtOTQ3OC00ZTlkLWIwZDYtYjNmNTc4ODljZjRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzg4ZjczMmYtOTQ3OC00ZTlkLWIwZDYtYjNmNTc4ODljZjRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266890/","name":"Ennio Fantastichini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170168/","name":"Giorgio Colangeli"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0223924/","name":"Gianni Di Gregorio"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0223924/","name":"Gianni Di Gregorio"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0089379/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0230609/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066197/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0223924/","name":"Gianni Di Gregorio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0678499/","name":"Marco Pettenello"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Tom Cruise, well-known for his tight control over the Mission Impossible franchise, micromanaged the 2017 remake of "The Mummy" to death. "Light of my Life" does not pretend to be a big-budget blockbuster, but its quality is undermined for a similar reason.\n\nCasey Affleck is the director, writer, and lead actor in this film. When he wrote the many monologues for the father to sermonize, no one took him aside and advised him to cut their number and length. When he delivered the monologues, no one told him that he needed to make his stuttering monotone more lilting and engaging. And clearly no one informed Casey as director that beginning the movie with a 12-minute (truth!) recitation of a Noah's Ark derivative story would kill audience interest at the outset.\n\nAnd that is the frustration I had throughout this movie. There were enough variations on the road trip theme that this could have been an enthralling movie. The father and daughter aren't merely trying to survive a post-apocalyptic environment. He needs to protect her from the real-life horrors that young women risk today, but on an astronomically larger scale.\n\nThe movie shines when it illustrates these risks and progresses the plot by driving them in their quest for the ultimate safe house. When the pair was forced to gauge the trustworthiness of new companions or they were fleeing from undesired ones, I was engaged and cheering them on. But active moments make up far too little of the film; if you watch the trailer, you've seen clips from most of them. Independent advisors would undoubtedly have counseled Affleck accordingly.\n\nThe movie also brushes past the details of both the epidemic and life after the epidemic. When the couple visited a government dispensary or the father mentioned how critical it was to have proper ID, I wanted to learn more about the world had morphed in response to the loss of half of its population. But no, the film doggedly returned to more rambling from the father as the two cower in a foxhole.\n\nI watched the whole movie because I was interested enough in the ending, but I strung it out over 3 days to minimize the tedium. If you decide to see it, fast forward through the first 12 minutes.

We joined a couple of dozen other viewers, socially distanced and masked up. I can't help wondering how the theaters are going to be able to turn a profit with this new normal.\n\nThis lovely film is a great starring vehicle for Gemma Arterton, who's become one of my favorites. Still in her mid-30's she's moved on from playing young attractive add-ons in fantasy films (Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia, or the crazy splashy fun of Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters) and has built a growing and varied record in films playing lead roles in smaller-scale personal dramas like Tamara Drewe, Gemma Bovary, Vita and Virginia, Their Finest, a great Saint Joan at the London National Theatre, and more. Can't wait to see her in the upcoming King's Man.\n\nIn Summerland she plays Alice Lamb, a prickly and reclusive writer who (during WWII) is researching the mirage-like atmospheric phenomenon called the "Fata Morgana". To her surprise and much against her will she is saddled with looking after young schoolboy Frank (Lucas Bond) who, like many other wartime children, has been sent out of London to the provinces to stay safely out of the Blitz. Frank is a basically good-natured kid who's not put off by this apparently crusty "old lady", and the main arch of the plot follows their developing relationship into one of mutual love. Flashbacks to Alice's pre-war association with friend (and more than friend) Vera (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) are shown that fill in much of what we need to know about Alice. In the meantime, Frank strikes up a close friendship with a classmate Edie (Dixie Egerickx) as they follow their natural kids' imperatives to explore everywhere around their little town and seaside.\n\nThose are just the basics, but the last third of the film goes beyond what I just said into more unexpected territory. Two or three major twists are coming, at least one of which is sort of predictable but at least one of which is certainly a surprise. But viewed from the end of the film looking backward, it makes sense. There's no cheating and nothing arbitrary. It's a much more complex story that it at first appears, it's well structured, and (especially) it's nicely paced. The scenery (the white cliffs and windswept meadows of Dover) has a role to play too, but it doesn't intrude on the story. No spoilers -- just go and see it to experience what I mean!\n\nThe two kids (Frank, Edie) are great: they're more than just placeholders filling in the gaps between the adult interactions in the story. Tom Courtenay makes a supporting appearance as an endearing, kindly schoolmaster. But this is Gemma Arterton's movie, make no mistake. She's grown into a masterful actress who (like all her recent parts) disappears so totally into her role that you're not even aware that she's acting. She has Oscar-level skill.

We joined a couple of dozen other viewers, socially distanced and masked up. I can't help wondering how the theaters are going to be able to turn a profit with this new normal.\n\nThis lovely film is a great starring vehicle for Gemma Arterton, who's become one of my favorites. Still in her mid-30's she's moved on from playing young attractive add-ons in fantasy films (Clash of the Titans, Prince of Persia, or the crazy splashy fun of Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters) and has built a growing and varied record in films playing lead roles in smaller-scale personal dramas like Tamara Drewe, Gemma Bovary, Vita and Virginia, Their Finest, a great Saint Joan at the London National Theatre, and more. Can't wait to see her in the upcoming King's Man.\n\nIn Summerland she plays Alice Lamb, a prickly and reclusive writer who (during WWII) is researching the mirage-like atmospheric phenomenon called the "Fata Morgana". To her surprise and much against her will she is saddled with looking after young schoolboy Frank (Lucas Bond) who, like many other wartime children, has been sent out of London to the provinces to stay safely out of the Blitz. Frank is a basically good-natured kid who's not put off by this apparently crusty "old lady", and the main arch of the plot follows their developing relationship into one of mutual love. Flashbacks to Alice's pre-war association with friend (and more than friend) Vera (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) are shown that fill in much of what we need to know about Alice. In the meantime, Frank strikes up a close friendship with a classmate Edie (Dixie Egerickx) as they follow their natural kids' imperatives to explore everywhere around their little town and seaside.\n\nThose are just the basics, but the last third of the film goes beyond what I just said into more unexpected territory. Two or three major twists are coming, at least one of which is sort of predictable but at least one of which is certainly a surprise. But viewed from the end of the film looking backward, it makes sense. There's no cheating and nothing arbitrary. It's a much more complex story that it at first appears, it's well structured, and (especially) it's nicely paced. The scenery (the white cliffs and windswept meadows of Dover) has a role to play too, but it doesn't intrude on the story. No spoilers -- just go and see it to experience what I mean!\n\nThe two kids (Frank, Edie) are great: they're more than just placeholders filling in the gaps between the adult interactions in the story. Tom Courtenay makes a supporting appearance as an endearing, kindly schoolmaster. But this is Gemma Arterton's movie, make no mistake. She's grown into a masterful actress who (like all her recent parts) disappears so totally into her role that you're not even aware that she's acting. She has Oscar-level skill. But without getting involved in big-budget big-publicity roles I'm not sure she will ever get one. Nevertheless, what she's giving us is art at a high level all the same. The Brits seem so expert at crafting these types of movies -- warm, low-key, compelling personal stories with great casts and a sense of history. We could do a lot worse than get more of them.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5222,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"2020-07-31","keywords":"love,lesbian,world war two,evacuee,lesbianism","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4123967001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGI5ZGI3NTAtMTA4Ny00MjVhLThiMmYtMTg2M2M5YmZmMjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGI5ZGI3NTAtMTA4Ny00MjVhLThiMmYtMTg2M2M5YmZmMjJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"During World War II, an Englishwoman "Gemma Arterton" opens her heart to an evacuee after initially resolving to be rid of him in this moving journey of womanhood, love and friendship.

Would it trigger me into drinking? Would it portray drinking in a positive light? Obviously I threw my doubts aside and watched it and I am glad I did. This film primarily tells the tale of Martin (Mads Mikkelsen) who is going through the motions of life. He is no longer effective as a teacher and his family life is lacking due to the alienation of his wife and kids. However, on a boozy night out with a group of co-workers / friends an idea is formed, based on Norwegian philosopher and psychologist Finn Skårderud's theory that humans are born with a blood alcohol level 0.050 lower than it should be, and that that amount should be drunk every day in order to bring about optimum performance levels. As all four friends engage in drinking in the morning things appear to work well, until the inevitable escalation. First off, this film is genuinely funny. Secondly, it is moving. Third, it is beautiful to look at. However if I were to judge this film as person who has a troubling relationship with alcohol and try to pinpoint a message to the film, then I would have some trouble. I believe the film is a commentary on the absurdity of Danish drinking culture. Not being Danish I maybe can't fully comprehend the social intricacies, but being British I can certainly understand (drinking is our culture). For better or worse this film doesn't appear to state definitively whether drinking alcohol is good or bad. Certainly you view tragedy born from over imbibing, but then it shows that there are some positives. For someone like me who wishes to moderate but can't and wants a binary judgement, this rubs me the wrong way.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106998,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-24","keywords":"heavy drinking,drinking,teacher,high school,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4070162713","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ4NGY3ZWEtMWYyMy00MzY4LWFlNzktYjdmMGFjYTIxNGJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ4NGY3ZWEtMWYyMy00MzY4LWFlNzktYjdmMGFjYTIxNGJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four friends, all high school teachers, test a theory that they will improve their lives by maintaining a constant level of alcohol in their blood."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586568/","name":"Mads Mikkelsen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488917/","name":"Thomas Bo Larsen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2099237/","name":"Magnus Millang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0899121/","name":"Thomas Vinterberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136662/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001935/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0338571/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0899121/","name":"Thomas Vinterberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2105585/","name":"Tobias Lindholm"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="fr">En 2020, la pandémie du Covid 19 a profondément bouleversé l'industrie du cinéma à Hollywood comme ailleurs. En raison des confinements et de la fermeture des cinémas, les longs-métrages n'ont pas pu sortir en salles. Après plusieurs semaines, certains studios ont décidé de sortir les films directement en VOD sur les différentes plateformes. Universal ouvre le bal avec "Trolls 2". Aux Etats-Unis comme ailleurs, les professionnels tentent de sortir de cette crise majeure. Ce documentaire revient sur cette année particulière où le septième art s'est arrêté à Hollywood.</desc>

I will be completely honest, the first 2 episodes really turned me off. I figured this season was heading down the same path as Roanoke and perhaps worse with the political and social overtones. HOWEVER, I decided to keep watching. Things have turned around dramatically and I am now engaged in this season. It is ridiculous and unbelievable, but the characters are now starting to show themselves and several secrets are now out in the open. The show has been very good the past 3 episodes and has officially drawn me back in.\n\nI will say this... the 5th episode "Holes" is brutal. I've been watching horror for over 30 years and I can honestly say I haven't had a scene un-nerve me to the extent this one did. Watch and you'll see what I mean.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":290815,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-10-05","keywords":"anthology,serial killer,male objectification,infidelity,supernatural","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000870/","name":"Kathy Bates","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000291/","name":"Angela Bassett"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060381/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314634/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0156994/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1004299/","name":"Brad Falchuk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614682/","name":"Ryan Murphy"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Part 1: Red Tide - Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3243294745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBmNjJmM2EtMTA4NC00YTg2LWJkY2UtZmRkZDc4YTdmMTA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBmNjJmM2EtMTA4NC00YTg2LWJkY2UtZmRkZDc4YTdmMTA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Your first taste.

    <desc lang="fr">Vivien Leigh, actrice britannique vingtenaire quasi inconnue, décroche le rôle de Scarlett O’Hara dans «Autant en emporte le vent» à la fin des années 1930. Sa prestation sera récompensée par l’Oscar de la meilleure actrice. Surfant sur sa notoriété, Vivien Leigh enchaîne cinq longs-métrages avant de remporter, en 1952, un second Oscar pour son incarnation bouleversante de Blanche DuBois dans «Un tramway nommé désir». Un tournage compliqué pour l’artiste, diagnostiquée bipolaire, qui est sujette à des crises au cours desquelles elle balance entre exaltation et abattement. Jusqu’à la fin de sa vie et malgré sa santé mentale vacillante, Vivien Leigh n’a cessé de travailler au cinéma comme au théâtre.</desc>

Holden is a very good actor given a very good role here as Sefton, a soldier that uniquely accepts his situation.  The other supporting, and even prominent roles are good but seems "intentionally" underdeveloped for the benefit of not complicating viewers with unnecessary information.

I have to say that although it may have lacked the grittiness of Spielberg's film, it still surpasses "Saving Private Ryan" for it's honest approach to it's characters such as the POW that responds to his wife's letter ("I believe it.") with a certain kind of feeling that can truly be described as honest and the German "Wake up caller" Scherbach's constant joking around with POWs while remaining true to his kommandant's wishes.  The 'Animal' and Shapiro characters were obviously created for comic relief but it should only be taken as that, comic relief (Hell, everyone's a comedian and at least they tried).

There arrives the British Ana Boulton (Geraldine Chaplin) , an ex-nanny accompanied by her hubby (Norman Brisky) and meets the three little girls she cared are now grown-up . There also shows up Natalia (Amparo Muñoz) who falls in love for Antonio . In this meeting , Ana to be aware that the stiff military José (José Maria Prada who actually passed away a bit later on) died three years ago ; Juan (José Vivó) abandoned his spouse Luchy (Charo Soriano) and Fernando (Fernando Fernán Gómez) carries out unsuccessful attempts to fly by Delta-wing . Meantime , Ana and the rare family go successively to José's tomb to pray him . Besides , Anna uncovers Juan , Fernando and Luchy attempt to kill their mom to get the valuable inheritance and her luxurious mansion to built an urbanization .\n\nDuring the seventies Carlos Saura shot a trilogy produced by Elias Querejeta about the selfish Spanish bourgeoisie or middle-class formed by ¨Jardín De Las Delicias¨ or "The Garden of Delights" (70) , ¨Ana Y Los Lobos¨ or ¨Anna and the wolves¨ (72) and ¨La Prima Angelica¨ or ¨Cousin Angelica¨ (73) . Carlos Saura directed in 1972 ¨Ana Y Los Lobos¨ in which a nanny/Geraldine Chaplin goes to educate three little girls at a mansion , there Ana is seduced , harassed , mistreated , raped by the elder sons : Fernando Fernan Gómez-José Vivó-José Maria Prada and finally killed . But in "Mama Turns 100" the omnipresent Ana is alive and married to Antonio/Norman Brisky . "Anna and the Wolves" had a symbolic and thoughtful tone , as the manor represented the peculiar Spain ruled by a dark Franquist period and the sons were the different political factions which discussed by that time ; and it got a sequel : "Mama Turns 100" with uneven results , as this one has a less provoking style than the original , being more a comedy that a brooding drama . This "Mama Turns 100" results to be a black as well as merry Dramedy dealing with a dysfunctional and utterly broken family in which some ruthless sons are embezzling mother's money and subsequently killing her . It is a coral film , a piece of nonsense and absurdity with grotesque roles magnificently played by a great plethora of actors . As nice acting by Geraldine Chaplin as an ex-nanny who returns a manor where she worked many years ago . Carlos Saura filmed 7 movies with Geraldine (his then wife) , and this one resulted to be their final collaboration . Excellent Fernando Fernan Gómez , as usual , he plays a weird man who is still living with his mummy and attempting to fly a hang glider . Special mention for Rafaela Aparicio who steals the show as a sympathetic and bigmouth grandmother . The picture contains an evocative and colorful cinematography by Teo Escamilla , Saura's regular . Being shot on location in Torrelodones , Madrid . \n\nThis Spanish/French co-production dark comedy was well but slowly written/directed by Carlos Saura , at his usual style . Saura is a good Spanish movies director who goes on nowadays filmmaking . He began working in cinema in 1959 when he filmed ¨Los Golfos ¨(1962) dealing with juvenile delinquency from a sociological point of view . Later on , he made ¨LLanto Por Un Bandido¨ or "Weeping for a Bandit" (1964) starred by an all European-star-cast . Saura is a well recognized filmmaker both nationally and internationally , and in proof of it he won a lot of prizes among which there are the following ones : Silver Bear in Festival of Berlin for ¨Peppermint Frappé¨ (1967) and the successful ¨La Caza¨ (1966) that also won numerous prizes in International Festivals and in which four characters facing each other and terminating into a jarring burst of violence and being full of political allegories . Saura achieved Special Jury Awards in Cannes for ¨La Prima Angélica¨ (1974) , and for ¨Cría Cuervos¨ (1976) . Also, the surrealistic and disconcerting comedy ¨Mamá Cumple Cien Años¨ (1979) got an Oscar nomination in 1979 as the best foreign film , and it also won the Special Jury Award at the San Sebastian Festival . He subsequently made ¨Deprisa , Deprisa¨ based on facts about juvenile delinquency in Spain of the 80s , as he tried to take a position in favour of outcast people and he got to make a both lyric and documentary-style cinema .

There arrives the British Ana Boulton (Geraldine Chaplin) , an ex-nanny accompanied by her hubby (Norman Brisky) and meets the three little girls she cared are now grown-up . There also shows up Natalia (Amparo Muñoz) who falls in love for Antonio . In this meeting , Ana to be aware that the stiff military José (José Maria Prada who actually passed away a bit later on) died three years ago ; Juan (José Vivó) abandoned his spouse Luchy (Charo Soriano) and Fernando (Fernando Fernán Gómez) carries out unsuccessful attempts to fly by Delta-wing . Meantime , Ana and the rare family go successively to José's tomb to pray him . Besides , Anna uncovers Juan , Fernando and Luchy attempt to kill their mom to get the valuable inheritance and her luxurious mansion to built an urbanization .\n\nDuring the seventies Carlos Saura shot a trilogy produced by Elias Querejeta about the selfish Spanish bourgeoisie or middle-class formed by ¨Jardín De Las Delicias¨ or "The Garden of Delights" (70) , ¨Ana Y Los Lobos¨ or ¨Anna and the wolves¨ (72) and ¨La Prima Angelica¨ or ¨Cousin Angelica¨ (73) . Carlos Saura directed in 1972 ¨Ana Y Los Lobos¨ in which a nanny/Geraldine Chaplin goes to educate three little girls at a mansion , there Ana is seduced , harassed , mistreated , raped by the elder sons : Fernando Fernan Gómez-José Vivó-José Maria Prada and finally killed . But in "Mama Turns 100" the omnipresent Ana is alive and married to Antonio/Norman Brisky . "Anna and the Wolves" had a symbolic and thoughtful tone , as the manor represented the peculiar Spain ruled by a dark Franquist period and the sons were the different political factions which discussed by that time ; and it got a sequel : "Mama Turns 100" with uneven results , as this one has a less provoking style than the original , being more a comedy that a brooding drama . This "Mama Turns 100" results to be a black as well as merry Dramedy dealing with a dysfunctional and utterly broken family in which some ruthless sons are embezzling mother's money and subsequently killing her . It is a coral film , a piece of nonsense and absurdity with grotesque roles magnificently played by a great plethora of actors . As nice acting by Geraldine Chaplin as an ex-nanny who returns a manor where she worked many years ago . Carlos Saura filmed 7 movies with Geraldine (his then wife) , and this one resulted to be their final collaboration . Excellent Fernando Fernan Gómez , as usual , he plays a weird man who is still living with his mummy and attempting to fly a hang glider . Special mention for Rafaela Aparicio who steals the show as a sympathetic and bigmouth grandmother . The picture contains an evocative and colorful cinematography by Teo Escamilla , Saura's regular . Being shot on location in Torrelodones , Madrid . \n\nThis Spanish/French co-production dark comedy was well but slowly written/directed by Carlos Saura , at his usual style . Saura is a good Spanish movies director who goes on nowadays filmmaking . He began working in cinema in 1959 when he filmed ¨Los Golfos ¨(1962) dealing with juvenile delinquency from a sociological point of view . Later on , he made ¨LLanto Por Un Bandido¨ or "Weeping for a Bandit" (1964) starred by an all European-star-cast . Saura is a well recognized filmmaker both nationally and internationally , and in proof of it he won a lot of prizes among which there are the following ones : Silver Bear in Festival of Berlin for ¨Peppermint Frappé¨ (1967) and the successful ¨La Caza¨ (1966) that also won numerous prizes in International Festivals and in which four characters facing each other and terminating into a jarring burst of violence and being full of political allegories . Saura achieved Special Jury Awards in Cannes for ¨La Prima Angélica¨ (1974) , and for ¨Cría Cuervos¨ (1976) . Also, the surrealistic and disconcerting comedy ¨Mamá Cumple Cien Años¨ (1979) got an Oscar nomination in 1979 as the best foreign film , and it also won the Special Jury Award at the San Sebastian Festival . He subsequently made ¨Deprisa , Deprisa¨ based on facts about juvenile delinquency in Spain of the 80s , as he tried to take a position in favour of outcast people and he got to make a both lyric and documentary-style cinema . In 1990 , he won two Goya , The Spanish Oscar , as best adapted screenplay writer and best director . Saura became an expert on Iberian musical adaptations as ¨Carmen¨ , ¨Amor Brujo¨ , ¨Bodas De Sangre¨ , ¨Sevillanas¨ , ¨Iberia¨ , ¨Salome¨ , ¨Fado¨ , ¨Flamenco¨ and even recently Opera as ¨Io , Don Giovanni¨","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1182,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1979-11-07","keywords":"full frontal female nudity,attempted flight,memory,hang glider,glider","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001036/","name":"Geraldine Chaplin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0616361/","name":"Amparo Muñoz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0273178/","name":"Fernando Fernán Gómez"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767022/","name":"Carlos Saura"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020931/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065243/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060888/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767022/","name":"Carlos Saura"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Without any money, they seek a job position for saxophone and bass players in another band and they are invited to play in a concert for one night only in a distant town. Joe borrows the car of a former girlfriend to travel and when they arrive in the parking garage, they witness the "Saint Valentine's Day Massacre" led by the infamous mobster Spats Columbo (George Raft). The criminals discover Joe and Jerry hidden in a corner and when the killers are ready to execute them, they succeed to escape. Joe and Jerry disguise, dressing like women and they head to Florida by train with an all-girl band using the names of Josephine and Daphne. They get close to singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) and Joe falls in love with her but she believes he is a woman. Meanwhile the millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) harasses Daphne inviting her to visit his yacht. When Spats and his henchmen arrive in the same hotel where Joe and Jerry are lodged for a mafia convention, the two musicians feel that they are in a dangerous situation.\n\nYesterday Tony Curtis died and I decided to watch "Some Like it Hot" again. This film is another masterpiece of Billy Wilder and certainly one of the best comedies of the cinema history. Jack Lemmon is hilarious and responsible for some of the funniest moments especially when Osgood flirts with Daphne. Marilyn Monroe performs the perfect dumb blonde stereotype. Last time I had seen this movie was on 18 August 2000. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Quanto Mais Quente Melhor" ("The Hotter, the Better")","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Comedy","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"1959-03-19","keywords":"sex comedy,comedy of errors,disguise,all girl band,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Some Like It Hot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2371683353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for the classic comedy Some Like It Hot, starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000054/","name":"Marilyn Monroe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000348/","name":"Tony Curtis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000493/","name":"Jack Lemmon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047869/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011112/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224634/","name":"I.A.L.

Without any money, they seek a job position for saxophone and bass players in another band and they are invited to play in a concert for one night only in a distant town. Joe borrows the car of a former girlfriend to travel and when they arrive in the parking garage, they witness the "Saint Valentine's Day Massacre" led by the infamous mobster Spats Columbo (George Raft). The criminals discover Joe and Jerry hidden in a corner and when the killers are ready to execute them, they succeed to escape. Joe and Jerry disguise, dressing like women and they head to Florida by train with an all-girl band using the names of Josephine and Daphne. They get close to singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) and Joe falls in love with her but she believes he is a woman. Meanwhile the millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) harasses Daphne inviting her to visit his yacht. When Spats and his henchmen arrive in the same hotel where Joe and Jerry are lodged for a mafia convention, the two musicians feel that they are in a dangerous situation.\n\nYesterday Tony Curtis died and I decided to watch "Some Like it Hot" again. This film is another masterpiece of Billy Wilder and certainly one of the best comedies of the cinema history. Jack Lemmon is hilarious and responsible for some of the funniest moments especially when Osgood flirts with Daphne. Marilyn Monroe performs the perfect dumb blonde stereotype. Last time I had seen this movie was on 18 August 2000. My vote is ten.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Quanto Mais Quente Melhor" ("The Hotter, the Better")","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Comedy","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"1959-03-19","keywords":"sex comedy,comedy of errors,disguise,all girl band,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Some Like It Hot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2371683353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for the classic comedy Some Like It Hot, starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000054/","name":"Marilyn Monroe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000348/","name":"Tony Curtis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000493/","name":"Jack Lemmon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047869/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011112/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224634/","name":"I.A.L.

I suppose anyone brought up on fin de siecle Hollywood would interpret that as `slow and boring'. But this was Hollywood tackling an intellectual piece with, well, intellect. I must confess that the thought of a 1945 Hollywood attempt at Oscar Wilde did not appeal. Memories of one or two previous efforts at English literary classics set alarm bells ringing. But this was in a class of its own. Beautifully photographed in black and white, apart from a couple shots of the painting itself, the aesthetics shimmer.\n\nI wasn't that convinced about some of the London scenes, especially the low-life portrayal of the East End. The opium den and the `Two Turtles', where Gray first meets Sibyl Vane, look rather too genteel. Compare this view of such places with those created by David Lean, just a couple of years later, in `Oliver Twist'. And this, in a sense, detracts from the depths to which Gray descends in order to be forever youthful and live life with scant regard for others. And in many years of watching BBC Victorian costume dramas I don't recall seeing such outfits on the backs of London's society ladies! However some of the other detail is first class. In particular Sir Thomas's decision to remain at table (`never could resist Aunt Agatha's quails') in spite of Lord Henry's outrageous comments rings true through to today. As the script had it `think like a Liberal, eat like a Tory'.\n\n The acting is excellent with Hurd Hatfield's portrayal quite remarkable in that he wears the same expression virtually throughout, in order, no doubt, to conceal his true emotions. George Sanders, as Lord Henry, steals every scene he's in thanks to a rapid delivery of Wilde's witticisms that would have Groucho Marx and Woody Allen in awe. Angela Lansbury is, perhaps, a little too demure for a theatrical singer from the East End but, no doubt, this was a result of director's orders.\n\nEssential viewing for anyone interested in the history of film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12538,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1945-03-03","keywords":"painting,painter,soul,hedonist,deal with the devil","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2741026585","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001695/","name":"George Sanders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0368836/","name":"Hurd Hatfield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001656/","name":"Donna Reed"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0928492/","name":"Oscar Wilde"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In particular Sir Thomas's decision to remain at table (`never could resist Aunt Agatha's quails') in spite of Lord Henry's outrageous comments rings true through to today. As the script had it `think like a Liberal, eat like a Tory'.\n\n The acting is excellent with Hurd Hatfield's portrayal quite remarkable in that he wears the same expression virtually throughout, in order, no doubt, to conceal his true emotions. George Sanders, as Lord Henry, steals every scene he's in thanks to a rapid delivery of Wilde's witticisms that would have Groucho Marx and Woody Allen in awe. Angela Lansbury is, perhaps, a little too demure for a theatrical singer from the East End but, no doubt, this was a result of director's orders.\n\nEssential viewing for anyone interested in the history of film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12538,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1945-03-03","keywords":"painting,painter,soul,hedonist,deal with the devil","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2741026585","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001695/","name":"George Sanders","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0368836/","name":"Hurd Hatfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001656/","name":"Donna Reed"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0928492/","name":"Oscar Wilde"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I came out of my local art house quivering. Even now, as I write, I detect a hint of paranoia.  I would go as far as to say Orson Welles' The Trial is the most frightening film I've ever beheld.

A fabulous film  one of the best.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100727,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Thriller","Western"],"datePublished":"1952-07-30","keywords":"one against many,sheriff,old west,fistfight,outlaw gang","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"High Noon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3442326553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmViZTI3MTgtZmQxNi00NmNjLWJiMjEtZmIyNzA3NGYxOTc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmViZTI3MTgtZmQxNi00NmNjLWJiMjEtZmIyNzA3NGYxOTc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000011/","name":"Gary Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000038/","name":"Grace Kelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593775/","name":"Thomas Mitchell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003593/","name":"Fred Zinnemann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136675/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0286025/","name":"Carl Foreman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192356/","name":"John W.

    <desc lang="fr">Différente des divas qui l'ont précédée, l'Italienne Anna Magnani, actrice sensuelle au regard magnétique, a offert un nouveau visage au cinéma : celui d'une femme libre, impressionnante de gravité et d'aplomb. Ce documentaire retrace la vie et la carrière riche en coups d'éclats et en traversées du désert d'une actrice douée, excessive et volcanique, à travers les souvenirs de son fils Luca et des cinéastes qui l'ont dirigée. Visconti, Fellini et Renoir racontent, notamment, le bouillonnant talent créatif dont elle nourrissait ses interprétations.</desc>

Neorealistic dramas of the forties and the fifties depict a country in comparison of which Transilvanya seems Disneyland, and that's not reasonable; comedies of the sixties and seventies are quite silly and superficial. This film, along with "C'eravamo tanto amati" in my opinion, is a perfectly balanced synthesis of both streams. There's fun and there's poverty, laughter and desperation, and this makes it the most truthful social portrait of this strange, controversial place I live in. It's a good summary of recent national history as well. And it contains two or three of the highest peaks of comedy of the entire world's cinema, see the argument with the restaurant owner for the bill (I fear it works only in Italian, though)or the dinner at the aristocratic family the evening of the elections for the choice between monarchy and republic. This is worth a couple of lines. Silvio, a leftist journalist and former guerrilla soldier against fascists, and his wife are rejected by restaurants because of their lack of money. They meet an aristocrat they know who invites them for dinner. The reason is not generosity but the fact that at that dinner there are thirteen people, and a common belief was that the circumstance would bring bad luck. At the table a full inventory of the meanest and most grotesque old fashioned conservative characters of the time, who, in an embarrassing way, try to hide their opinion on the new despicable hosts and to be kind to them. As the dishes arrive the couple forget good manners and make a show of themselves. Conversation falls on politics and Silvio enworsen his situation with some bitter comments, while his wife kicks him under the table. Suddenly come the results of the elections: Italians chose republic! Someone faint, some other curse, but Silvio and his wife hug each other. The monarchists, now mad, leave the room and here comes the scene you'll remember: the butler comes, bearing a bottle of champagne, solemnly he approaches the two proletarians and fills their glasses in silence.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1961-12-22","keywords":"italy,journalist,husband wife relationship,communist party,commedia all'italiana","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814773/","name":"Alberto Sordi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0557159/","name":"Lea Massari"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0264770/","name":"Franco Fabrizi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0728271/","name":"Dino Risi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032861/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814242/","name":"Rodolfo Sonego"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Neorealistic dramas of the forties and the fifties depict a country in comparison of which Transilvanya seems Disneyland, and that's not reasonable; comedies of the sixties and seventies are quite silly and superficial. This film, along with "C'eravamo tanto amati" in my opinion, is a perfectly balanced synthesis of both streams. There's fun and there's poverty, laughter and desperation, and this makes it the most truthful social portrait of this strange, controversial place I live in. It's a good summary of recent national history as well. And it contains two or three of the highest peaks of comedy of the entire world's cinema, see the argument with the restaurant owner for the bill (I fear it works only in Italian, though)or the dinner at the aristocratic family the evening of the elections for the choice between monarchy and republic. This is worth a couple of lines. Silvio, a leftist journalist and former guerrilla soldier against fascists, and his wife are rejected by restaurants because of their lack of money. They meet an aristocrat they know who invites them for dinner. The reason is not generosity but the fact that at that dinner there are thirteen people, and a common belief was that the circumstance would bring bad luck. At the table a full inventory of the meanest and most grotesque old fashioned conservative characters of the time, who, in an embarrassing way, try to hide their opinion on the new despicable hosts and to be kind to them. As the dishes arrive the couple forget good manners and make a show of themselves. Conversation falls on politics and Silvio enworsen his situation with some bitter comments, while his wife kicks him under the table. Suddenly come the results of the elections: Italians chose republic! Someone faint, some other curse, but Silvio and his wife hug each other. The monarchists, now mad, leave the room and here comes the scene you'll remember: the butler comes, bearing a bottle of champagne, solemnly he approaches the two proletarians and fills their glasses in silence.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1961-12-22","keywords":"italy,journalist,husband wife relationship,communist party,commedia all'italiana","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814773/","name":"Alberto Sordi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0557159/","name":"Lea Massari","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0264770/","name":"Franco Fabrizi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0728271/","name":"Dino Risi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032861/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814242/","name":"Rodolfo Sonego"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Perhaps people are reacting to the insidiousness of the world of corporate espionage, pornography, lovelessness, pleasurelessness, etc. on display in every corner of the movie. Although its final 30 minutes or so veer toward incoherence--the meaning of what ultimately happens seems less interesting as a resolution than in (for example) "Mulholland Drive"--it's a cool, controlled, provocative rethinking of the modern techno thriller. It's a far more subtle and nuanced movie than the kind of head trip movies that kids go for these days ("Requiem for a Dream," bleh!), and the Sonic Youth score and cinematography are terrific.\n\nI was originally attracted to the film on the strengths of Assayas' other films--all three I've seen ("Irma Vep", "Late August/Early Sept.", "Les Destinees Sentimentales") excellent and each in its own way unique.

Perhaps people are reacting to the insidiousness of the world of corporate espionage, pornography, lovelessness, pleasurelessness, etc. on display in every corner of the movie. Although its final 30 minutes or so veer toward incoherence--the meaning of what ultimately happens seems less interesting as a resolution than in (for example) "Mulholland Drive"--it's a cool, controlled, provocative rethinking of the modern techno thriller. It's a far more subtle and nuanced movie than the kind of head trip movies that kids go for these days ("Requiem for a Dream," bleh!), and the Sonic Youth score and cinematography are terrific.\n\nI was originally attracted to the film on the strengths of Assayas' other films--all three I've seen ("Irma Vep", "Late August/Early Sept.", "Les Destinees Sentimentales") excellent and each in its own way unique. His work is eclectic and unpredictable in the best sense, seemingly at ease with big or small productions--in the great tradition of Jonathan Demme or Michael Winterbottom or Louis Malle. This is probably the only one of his films so far that could have attracted an American audience, but the chilliness of its surfaces apparently has scared a few too many away.

    <desc lang="fr">Le 22 mars 1895, à la Société d'encouragement pour l'Industrie Nationale, à Paris, Auguste et Louis Lumière dévoilent leur invention, le cinématographe à une assistance triée sur le volet. Parmi les participants de cette séance privée, qui précède de quelques mois la célèbre projection publique du film «La Sortie des usines Lumière», on trouve notamment l'inventeur et ingénieur Léon Gaumont et sa secrétaire de 22 ans, Alice Guy. La jeune femme est fascinée par le procédé. Alice, qui a connu une enfance internationale, a rapidement intégré, comme secrétaire, Le comptoir général de photographie.</desc>

I love David Fincher, and he does not disappoint in terms of direction.  In general, it's full of great visuals.  The opening sequence and a couple other scenes are an incredible testament to the realistic computer graphics available today.  Color, focus, angle, and a myriad of other elements also make this film stimulating visually.  All the actors do their parts justice; Jodie Foster is convincing, the daughter pulls off apathy and so forth, Whitaker comes across as a reluctant man forced by circumstance, and there's a great (albeit small) performance by Cop #1.\n\nHowever, good acting and good direction do not make this film.  The plot moves snappily for the first half of the film, but almost every twist is predictable, and the pace begins to drag, hiccuping along into the second half. On a positive note, there is a great deal of dead-on comedy woven into the lulls; but afterwards it almost feels forced.  Also, gore was added to the film for no apparent reason.  To make matters worse, I was very unsatisfied by the climax and resolution.  To what degree Koepp deserves the blame for these mismatched, unpleasant elements I do not know, but in my opinion he hasn't written a great script since Jurassic Park, which had all the comedy of Panic Room, but must have stolen the suspense from the second half.\n\nOverall, I'd give this movie 2 out of 5.  The plot simply disappoints. Worth seeing if you're a fan of Fincher or any of the actors, but not worth buying."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268510,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-06-19","keywords":"panic,panic room,cat and mouse,secret room,female protagonist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Panic Room","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2896101657","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODJiZmU2ODAtYWQ1My00ZjM3LWJmYzAtODNlNzE2OTc4ZjI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODJiZmU2ODAtYWQ1My00ZjM3LWJmYzAtODNlNzE2OTc4ZjI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Columbia Tristar"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001845/","name":"Forest Whitaker"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000399/","name":"David Fincher"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030084/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036309/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I love David Fincher, and he does not disappoint in terms of direction.  In general, it's full of great visuals.  The opening sequence and a couple other scenes are an incredible testament to the realistic computer graphics available today.  Color, focus, angle, and a myriad of other elements also make this film stimulating visually.  All the actors do their parts justice; Jodie Foster is convincing, the daughter pulls off apathy and so forth, Whitaker comes across as a reluctant man forced by circumstance, and there's a great (albeit small) performance by Cop #1.\n\nHowever, good acting and good direction do not make this film.  The plot moves snappily for the first half of the film, but almost every twist is predictable, and the pace begins to drag, hiccuping along into the second half. On a positive note, there is a great deal of dead-on comedy woven into the lulls; but afterwards it almost feels forced.  Also, gore was added to the film for no apparent reason.  To make matters worse, I was very unsatisfied by the climax and resolution.  To what degree Koepp deserves the blame for these mismatched, unpleasant elements I do not know, but in my opinion he hasn't written a great script since Jurassic Park, which had all the comedy of Panic Room, but must have stolen the suspense from the second half.\n\nOverall, I'd give this movie 2 out of 5.  The plot simply disappoints. Worth seeing if you're a fan of Fincher or any of the actors, but not worth buying.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268510,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-06-19","keywords":"panic,panic room,cat and mouse,secret room,female protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Panic Room","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2896101657","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODJiZmU2ODAtYWQ1My00ZjM3LWJmYzAtODNlNzE2OTc4ZjI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODJiZmU2ODAtYWQ1My00ZjM3LWJmYzAtODNlNzE2OTc4ZjI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Columbia Tristar","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001845/","name":"Forest Whitaker"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000399/","name":"David Fincher"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030084/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036309/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Even when they describe complex and controversial characters they try to explain and to put in context the motivation of deeds which in the perspective of history seem evil. Paolo Sorrentino's 'Il Divo' is quite the contrary, it is a negative biography about a character who dominated the Italian politics for most of the second part of the 20th century, the leader of the Christian-Democratic Party and seven-times Prime Minister of Italy, Giulio Andreotti. The film does not lack complexity - quite the contrary - and the historical context of the 80s and 90s is described in detail, but the effect is willingly opposite than in usual biographies. Even political actions which would have seen candid or neutral seem to catch a strong significance and are seen through the perspective of the corruption and Mafia-relations which seem to have dominated Italian political life of the period.\n\nMy knowledge about the Italian politics is too superficial to make a definite judgment about the correctness of the facts presented on screen. What I can say after seeing the film is that it does not seem to pretend to be objective. Even if there is no explicit statement, there is neither any positive angle we brought into the film or positive dimension that is not questioned. Even the relationship with his wife ('I knew all these years what kind of man I married') or helping the poor (which looks more like a political exercise deprived of sincerity). There are however many other scenes (like the repeated walk on empty streets surrounded by cohorts of security people, the reception after his last nomination as Prime Minister) which describe not only the outer-worldness of the man, but also of the whole system.\n\nEven more amazing is the fact that Andreotti was alive when this film was made (he actually died about a month ago) and has seen at least part of the film, allegedly walking out after a while. So this is not only a biography, but a pamphlet directed against a living politician. Andreotti, by the way, was no stranger to the Italian cinema industry, he played an important role in establishing the rules that protected the local industry against foreign (especially Hollywood) imports in the 50s, but also the establishment of a de-facto censorship over the content of the productions which was in place for many decades. Is this film also kind of a revenge of the now free industry over this character? Maybe.\n\nTo a very large extent 'Il DIvo' relies on the extraordinary acting performance of Toni Servillo. He makes one of these creations which in time tend to superpose and replace the visual representation we have about the real-life person. Great acting indeed, but do we end by understanding better Giulio Andreotti the man? I doubt it. Paolo Sorrentino certainly knows how to construct complex characters which do not show easily their intense internal beings. Looking now retrospectively he did the same thing in This Must Be the Place (which he made later, but I saw it before). He does not however serve the viewers with ready prepared answers about the motivation of his heroes. I knew very little about Andreotti before seeing this film, I know many more facts now, but the man remains a mystery.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16813,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-05-28","keywords":"prime minister,politician,cold war era,crooked politician,shady","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Il Divo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1745617689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNzc0OTg5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQxNzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNzc0OTg5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQxNzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has been elected to Parliament seven times since is was established in 1946."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785842/","name":"Toni Servillo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093718/","name":"Anna Bonaiuto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0097917/","name":"Giulio Bosetti"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815204/","name":"Paolo Sorrentino"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132227/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003461/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0223818/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815204/","name":"Paolo Sorrentino"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the 1800s, two elderly maiden ladies (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in remote Jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities, and personal happiness in order to continue their long-dead father's religious ministry to the small flock he served. One of the women's youthful admirers sends to them a Frenchwoman, Babette (Stéphane Audran), whose husband and son have been killed in France and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate. Although they do not really require her services, the sisters engage her as maid and cook--and as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined; indeed, the entire village admires and depends upon her.\n\nOne day, however, Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now, by village standards, a wealthy woman. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France, the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation. The meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember--but not for reasons that might be expected, for Babette's feast proves to be food for both body and soul, and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her.\n\nThe film is extraordinary in every way, meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them. As the film progresses, we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to God and their all-too-human frailties, and the scenes in which Babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful, and incredibly memorable. There have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love, but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of BABETTE'S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul. Highly, highly recommended.\n\nGary F.

On the other hand he hates conformity, conventions, market-oriented society, the establishment  His latest opus "Le Grand Appartement (The Very Big Apartment) is the perfect epitome of all of the philosophic likes and dislikes of the French director, regularly illustrated in all his films, from his first feature "Les Zozos" to "Les Maris, les Femmes, Les Amants" to "La Pagaille" to "La Dilettante" (all telltale titles indeed!).\n\nIn this one you get them all: - Francesca, a libertarian heroine with a sense of responsibility - a place in which people of all ages and generations, with a good number of unconventional artists among them, live together somehow or other, a bit like in the Utopian communities of the 1970's. And as heaven cannot exist without its counterpart hell their "ideal" world is is threatened by obnoxious representatives of the mainstream capitalist society, such as the bailiff, the money-grubbing landlady and lawyer. The viewer is plunged at once in the shambolic atmosphere of the big apartment and is made an immediate accomplice to these engaging although imperfect  characters. The plot is a bit lazy following two main guidelines, Mathieu's affair and the landlady's case against Francesca, but Thomas often indulges in the never-ending discussions between the members of the group. Which is a minor sin as the story matters less than the characters and the events less than the overall atmosphere. And it is to be said that the viewer (at least this viewer, for not everybody liked this pic) feels good in the company of this young "Mother Courage" (Laetitia Casta, not just a brainless top model), of her insecure but self-centered husband (Mathieu Amalric, always at ease with unease), of their parasitic movie maker friend Adrien (Pierre Arditi, at once charming, funny and annoying), and their various eccentric grannies, relatives, kiddies and occasional visitors.\n\nThere are good lines, a few hilarious scenes (particularly the sequences involving "cat on a hot tin roof" Véronique ( played gleefully by lively newcomer Stéphanie Pasterkamp), a lot of relevant digs at bureaucracy and consumer society. And let's not forget this conversation between Casta and her sister Victoria about yes or no women should keep their hairs under their armpits!

On the other hand he hates conformity, conventions, market-oriented society, the establishment  His latest opus "Le Grand Appartement (The Very Big Apartment) is the perfect epitome of all of the philosophic likes and dislikes of the French director, regularly illustrated in all his films, from his first feature "Les Zozos" to "Les Maris, les Femmes, Les Amants" to "La Pagaille" to "La Dilettante" (all telltale titles indeed!).\n\nIn this one you get them all: - Francesca, a libertarian heroine with a sense of responsibility - a place in which people of all ages and generations, with a good number of unconventional artists among them, live together somehow or other, a bit like in the Utopian communities of the 1970's. And as heaven cannot exist without its counterpart hell their "ideal" world is is threatened by obnoxious representatives of the mainstream capitalist society, such as the bailiff, the money-grubbing landlady and lawyer. The viewer is plunged at once in the shambolic atmosphere of the big apartment and is made an immediate accomplice to these engaging although imperfect  characters. The plot is a bit lazy following two main guidelines, Mathieu's affair and the landlady's case against Francesca, but Thomas often indulges in the never-ending discussions between the members of the group. Which is a minor sin as the story matters less than the characters and the events less than the overall atmosphere. And it is to be said that the viewer (at least this viewer, for not everybody liked this pic) feels good in the company of this young "Mother Courage" (Laetitia Casta, not just a brainless top model), of her insecure but self-centered husband (Mathieu Amalric, always at ease with unease), of their parasitic movie maker friend Adrien (Pierre Arditi, at once charming, funny and annoying), and their various eccentric grannies, relatives, kiddies and occasional visitors.\n\nThere are good lines, a few hilarious scenes (particularly the sequences involving "cat on a hot tin roof" Véronique ( played gleefully by lively newcomer Stéphanie Pasterkamp), a lot of relevant digs at bureaucracy and consumer society. And let's not forget this conversation between Casta and her sister Victoria about yes or no women should keep their hairs under their armpits! The subject might sound superficial but it in fact breaks a taboo. How many times has the subject been directly addressed in a movie (besides "Bridget Jones" of course)? It is very refreshing to see a renowned top model like Laetitia Casta advocating for one of the liberties women have not acquired yet!\n\nFor Pascal Thomas the whole world is a mess but a shambles is better, for out of it life is born.

The title character has serious body-image issues (unfounded of course) and serious sibling rivalry issues. Her sister's announcement of her engagement drives Jojo to claim a similar attachment, though at rising 30 she is living alone in her grandma's Paris apartment with her cat. Jojo's engagement is entirely imaginary, leading her into a maelstrom of deception and silliness worthy of Meg Ryan's worst. \n\nThe film is enormously derivative, and any fan of fluff will recognise the sources: the many, many "gotta have a boyfriend to show off at the party" films, the news story a few years back of the Japanese woman living in someone's apartment without the owner's knowledge; even the background music is strongly reminiscent of same in "You've Got Mail" (I was not the only person who noticed this when we watched it.) The individual actors do what they can, and their performances are good, but the script was weak and the end patched on. While watching this, we were all tempted more than once to just stop the film. I've seen many romcoms that manage to wrap up the silliness in a satisfying way, but this is not one of them. IMDb's board says that people who liked this film also liked "Vilaine" (which receives more than one nod in Josephine). Vilaine is a much better film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1408,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-06-19","keywords":"triple f rated,f rated,based on comic book,male nudity,male rear nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1317583897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGEwNzNkMzQtMTkxMi00MTg5LWFlNzItMjk0MDM3MTBmMDQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGEwNzNkMzQtMTkxMi00MTg5LWFlNzItMjk0MDM3MTBmMDQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0077622/","name":"Marilou Berry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0623854/","name":"Mehdi Nebbou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3757235/","name":"Bérengère Krief"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0643130/","name":"Agnès Obadia"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0367060/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0313479/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0643130/","name":"Agnès Obadia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1142065/","name":"Samantha Mazeras"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4717265/","name":"Pénélope Bagieu"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The individual actors do what they can, and their performances are good, but the script was weak and the end patched on. While watching this, we were all tempted more than once to just stop the film. I've seen many romcoms that manage to wrap up the silliness in a satisfying way, but this is not one of them. IMDb's board says that people who liked this film also liked "Vilaine" (which receives more than one nod in Josephine). Vilaine is a much better film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1408,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-06-19","keywords":"triple f rated,f rated,based on comic book,male nudity,male rear nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1317583897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGEwNzNkMzQtMTkxMi00MTg5LWFlNzItMjk0MDM3MTBmMDQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGEwNzNkMzQtMTkxMi00MTg5LWFlNzItMjk0MDM3MTBmMDQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0077622/","name":"Marilou Berry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0623854/","name":"Mehdi Nebbou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3757235/","name":"Bérengère Krief"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0643130/","name":"Agnès Obadia"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0367060/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0313479/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0643130/","name":"Agnès Obadia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1142065/","name":"Samantha Mazeras","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4717265/","name":"Pénélope Bagieu"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But the basic elements seemed like they'd adapt well to film. However, when this came out I heard very mixed things about it, mostly that it was very pretty to look at but not very compelling otherwise. So it's taken me a long time to get to it.\n\nIndeed, it's a very good-looking movie, maybe more genteel than the story needed. You don't get much sense of conflict except in isolated scenes, and the dynamic between the brothers seemed less intense than what I remembered from the book--maybe because Brad Pitt is at the height of his "I don't need to act, just stand around and look pretty" early phase, his charaacter never seems much of a troubled soul, let alone a doomed one. The much more briefly seen figure of the romantic lead's brother is far vivid as someone who's his own worst enemy. Craig Sheffer's character is better defined, but on the other hand you can see why that actor's career didn't really take off--he's perfectly fine, but there's no memorable personality or particular charisma behind the competence. The supporting performances are decent enough.\n\nIt's an OK movie, but all its expensive craftsmanship can't substitute for the real inspiration this story really needed to come alive onscreen. Redford is usually a solid director, but he's very literal-minded, and has no particular flair for action or tension. He's good at elevating dialogue- and issue-driven material like "Ordinary People," but this film needed a poet's sensibility, and Redford is more like a dutiful transcriptionist. Then again, plenty of people think the book is a great work of art, because it acts the part of being one. Similarly, this movie may strike some as a classic because it looks and sounds as if stuffed with gravitas. I just wish I actually FELT that gravitas, rather than feeling the movie's earnest self-importance without being particularly moved by the characters, the story or even the picture-postcard photography.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55790,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1992-10-30","keywords":"fishing,river,teenager,self discovery,coming of age","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A River Runs Through It","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3568566553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFlNTliMzUtOWI3Ni00YWRjLTlmZjUtOTFmNzM4MGQ4ZDIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFlNTliMzUtOWI3Ni00YWRjLTlmZjUtOTFmNzM4MGQ4ZDIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001729/","name":"Craig Sheffer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000643/","name":"Tom Skerritt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000602/","name":"Robert Redford"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052092/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034515/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533805/","name":"Norman Maclean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295030/","name":"Richard Friedenberg"}],"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I was the only bloke on my own.\n\nNow, many enjoy a romantic film; generally, I don't. Audrey Tautou was definitely the selling point for me. I'm sure a good number will find Delicacy a delightful film, full of life's quirks and nicely Gallic, too.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the scenes are in and around the workplace, the direction is boring and the camera-work often rather lazy. And, the film is getting on for being seriously long - 108mins for a rom-com is pushing it a bit.\n\nThankfully, the characters are rather more interesting with our lovely Tautou generally rather underplaying her lead role and came across as being slightly disinterested, though this may have been intentional.

I was the only bloke on my own.\n\nNow, many enjoy a romantic film; generally, I don't. Audrey Tautou was definitely the selling point for me. I'm sure a good number will find Delicacy a delightful film, full of life's quirks and nicely Gallic, too.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the scenes are in and around the workplace, the direction is boring and the camera-work often rather lazy. And, the film is getting on for being seriously long - 108mins for a rom-com is pushing it a bit.\n\nThankfully, the characters are rather more interesting with our lovely Tautou generally rather underplaying her lead role and came across as being slightly disinterested, though this may have been intentional. There are a couple of scenes that she acts masterfully, though and these help keep us interested.\n\nThe scenario goes something like this - Nathalie (Tautau) is distraught when her perfect life partner tragically dies.

Bad Faith tackles the same core issues, and while it does have its funny moments, contains more thoughtful insights to this real world predicament.\n\nIsmael (Roschidy Zem, who also directed this movie) and Clara (Cecile De France) are the perfect cross-cultural couple who has spent the last 4 years in a trouble-free relationship. Being non-practising in their respective religions (he's Muslim while she's Jew), the notion of religion, race and culture doesn't factor into their relationship until the coming of an unexpected baby. The consideration of having to inform their respective parents fed on their fears of having them reject their other half, and it even boils right down to details such as the baby's name, whom Ismael is dead set with naming him after his dad.\n\nThis exploration of unfounded fears provide much verbose insight to some of the nagging thoughts one would probably have when trying to appease the older generation, who in their earnestness would like to see an in-law coming from the same cultural/religious background for ease of assimilating with one another, and the potential avoidance of conflicts. At one point, one of the parents requested their child to consider all the trouble they would expect from frowning neighbours in their community, which stem from the lack of understanding, and fueled by deep prejudice and discrimination.\n\nWhich is a reminder that usually, a union of 2 actually is a union of more, which includes immediate family members, like it or not, who play a huge role in determining if the union thereafter would be stress-free. Clara's parents Victor (Jean-Pierre Cassel) and Lucie (Martine Chevallier) become confused with their daughter's choice for a husband, and the former works at Ismael being converted to Judaism to appease his wife, much to Ismael's amusement. On the other hand, Ismael finds difficulty in breaking the news to his mother, for fear of what he thinks will be a downright disapproval given Clara's background.\n\nThis examination of issues will test the resolve, depth of love and trust that the couple has for each other as it tears through the fabric of their open-mindedness and beliefs, and it's not always just between the two couple though, as Ismael's best friend Milou (Pascal Elbe) who is also a Jew, provide yet another outlet for the venting of frustration and deep rooted fears.\n\nBut don't be mistaken it's not all doom and gloom. Despite some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments, Bad Faith does provide for some critical moments where you're more than likely to be finding yourself rooting for the couple against all adversary that come their way. Both leads are charismatic enough for anyone in the audience to want to wish their characters well (The last time I saw Cecile De France was in the bloody gore movie High Tension, so it's a very different take here to see her in a romantic comedy) and it does play on some of our unfounded fears, so it's really just taking things as they come, while remaining optimistic that they will indeed turn out for the better, especially when you have love conquering all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":625,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-12-06","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0208426/","name":"Cécile de France"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954704/","name":"Roschdy Zem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253018/","name":"Pascal Elbé"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954704/","name":"Roschdy Zem"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060537/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954704/","name":"Roschdy Zem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253018/","name":"Pascal Elbé"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0755389/","name":"Agnès de Sacy"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But if you do not see this one, you did not miss anything important.\n\nSo for you who are still interested the storyline: Jean-Jacques is a highly creative chef, but his imaginative duck rolls are not at all appreciated by his boss. The time has come for him to leave his secure job behind and open his own restaurant... Claude is a instructor for corporate entrepreneurs, but he would prefer to be a writer. It's time for him to give it all up and finally write his novel... Together, the two men could offer each other support in times of need, no longer be under stress and make their dreams come true...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-01-01","keywords":"male objectification,male full frontal nudity,hairy chest,pubic hair,male pubic hair","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180404/","name":"Clovis Cornillac","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687914/","name":"Denis Podalydès","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0480831/","name":"Axelle Laffont"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893107/","name":"Eric Veniard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028908/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070074/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893107/","name":"Eric Veniard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452723/","name":"Husky Kihal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065892/","name":"Julie Lopes-Curval"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Looked it up on IMDb; not so good - an average of 5/10. Scroll down further and voilà! Written by Tom Hanks himself, gotta see it. And I'm glad I did.\n\nFirst, let me get the 'acting' part out of the way - It's good. Not mind-blowing, but most certainly good enough to be worth the US$9 weekend price of a movie ticket here in Singapore. The actors were good enough that I felt connected, and that's as good as it ever has to be.\n\nAs for the plot - nothing jaw-droppingly complicated and twisted, but then again neither was Forest Gump. And what a big success that movie proved to be. Don't expect character development to blow you away, but it did, at the very least, impress me.\n\nOf course, if you walk into the theater expecting "Harold &amp; Kumar" or "Chuck &amp; Larry" humor, you would most definitely be sorely disappointed. Some others have criticized the film, saying that it had "cheap laughs" at best. Now that isn't necessarily true, because it all depends on what your expectations are.\n\nSo hear this - Larry Crowne isn't an all-out-LOL-fest, it's a wholesome film sprinkled with subtle, clever, and thoughtful humor.\n\nIn my opinion, this film was an excellent cross-section representation of the sandwiched American Middle-class - too rich to qualify for welfare, too poor to save any money. Most people (outside the United States) wouldn't know the America shown throughout this film - where folks are priced out of their own states, where they attend community colleges that aren't crazy over keg parties and crawling with bikini-straddling blonds, where students have to juggle work and school, where they might have to choose the former over the latter too often.\n\nHollywood glamorizes the American lifestyle each and every chance it gets, and this film provides a rare glimpse into the real America where most people reside.\n\nAll things considered, I would consider this film a feel-good movie, and there's much more to it than meets the eye. If you enjoyed Forest Gump, you'd most likely enjoy this one - even if the feel-goodness sets in slightly more subtly.\n\nOne final thing - I've never written a review for any movie before, ever. But I felt that the reviews here (as of 9th July 11) were doing Larry Crowne such injustice that I had to write this to balance it out.\n\nCheers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65756,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-07-01","keywords":"character name as title,unsuccessful,male protagonist,feet,high heels","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Larry Crowne - Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1973459993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxOTc0NDY2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0NTk1NQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxOTc0NDY2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0NTk1NQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After losing his job, a middle-aged man (Tom Hanks) reinvents himself by going back to college."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2089529/","name":"Sarah Mahoney"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251081/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0889522/","name":"Nia Vardalos"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Some others have criticized the film, saying that it had "cheap laughs" at best. Now that isn't necessarily true, because it all depends on what your expectations are.\n\nSo hear this - Larry Crowne isn't an all-out-LOL-fest, it's a wholesome film sprinkled with subtle, clever, and thoughtful humor.\n\nIn my opinion, this film was an excellent cross-section representation of the sandwiched American Middle-class - too rich to qualify for welfare, too poor to save any money. Most people (outside the United States) wouldn't know the America shown throughout this film - where folks are priced out of their own states, where they attend community colleges that aren't crazy over keg parties and crawling with bikini-straddling blonds, where students have to juggle work and school, where they might have to choose the former over the latter too often.\n\nHollywood glamorizes the American lifestyle each and every chance it gets, and this film provides a rare glimpse into the real America where most people reside.\n\nAll things considered, I would consider this film a feel-good movie, and there's much more to it than meets the eye. If you enjoyed Forest Gump, you'd most likely enjoy this one - even if the feel-goodness sets in slightly more subtly.\n\nOne final thing - I've never written a review for any movie before, ever. But I felt that the reviews here (as of 9th July 11) were doing Larry Crowne such injustice that I had to write this to balance it out.\n\nCheers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65756,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-07-01","keywords":"character name as title,unsuccessful,male protagonist,feet,high heels","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Larry Crowne - Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1973459993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxOTc0NDY2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0NTk1NQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxOTc0NDY2N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDk0NTk1NQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After losing his job, a middle-aged man (Tom Hanks) reinvents himself by going back to college.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2089529/","name":"Sarah Mahoney"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251081/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0889522/","name":"Nia Vardalos"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's been 80 years since THE WIZARD OF OZ was released and 50 years since Judy Garland died. So why do we still care so much? Of course the obvious reason is that, for many generations, her adventures as Dorothy Gale from Kansas marked the first time many of us kids could put ourselves in the shoes (mine weren't ruby sparkles) of a lead character in a movie. Her fantastical journey ignited our imaginations and whisked us away to fight witches and flying monkeys, while making wonderful friends in a corn patch and enchanted forest. Oh, and that voice! However, there is another side to this coin. Judy's story is also an example of the dark and tarnished side of Hollywood ... she pulled back more than one curtain.\n\nRenee Zellweger (Oscar winner for COLD MOUNTAIN, 2003) stars as Judy Garland, and her performance will likely put her in line for her fourth Oscar nomination. The film basically covers the last year of Judy's life, and director Rupert Goold (TRUE STORY, 2015) is working from a script by Tom Edge adapted from Peter Quilter's stage play, "End of the Rainbow". There is no Lollipop Guild here. Instead, the harsh realities of Judy's life are explored. The film opens with Judy and her kids, Joe and Lorna, performing on stage ... and then being unceremoniously denied a room at a nearby luxury hotel. See, Judy's career is in a bad way (admittedly undependable and uninsurable) - as is her health. She is broke, has no home, and offers for roles or performances have dried up. She ends up at her ex-husband Sid Luft's (Rufus Sewell) home, which after some former-spouse bickering, is where the kids stay.\n\nWith no other real prospective gigs, Judy accepts an offer from Bernard Delfont (Michael Gambon) to perform at his Talk of the Town theatre in London. Most of the film covers her time in London, and the challenges for all involved. She's 46 years old in the winter of 1968, and though her voice no longer carries the sublime purity of those early years, Judy still has incredible stage presence and an ability to connect with the audience. The challenges occur for her assigned assistant Rosalyn Wilder (who served as a consultant on the film, and is played here by rising star Jessie Buckley), as well as Judy herself. She misses her kids, and is battling loneliness and an addiction to pills - causing her to rarely eat or sleep. When her "friend" (and fifth husband) Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock) shows up, Judy's attitude perks up, but her already questionable dependability falters.\n\nFlashbacks to Judy's teenage years at MGM are used to portray how the studio and industry took control of her body, soul and career. Watching studio head Louis B Mayer (Richard Cordery) bully young Judy (played by newcomer Darci Shaw) by pretending to be a father figure while keeping her weight in line with a diet of cigarettes, diet pills, and soup, is just painful. These scenes, including those with young Judy's frequent co-star Mickey Rooney, help us understand why she was in such a state by the time she hit London. Ms. Zellweger embodies the blend of frailty and determination and talent, as well as the insecurities that simultaneously drove Judy and held her back. Of course, few singers have ever possessed the vocal talent of Judy, but Zellweger admirably brings the appropriate strain and pain to the songs she sings for the movie, including "By Myself" and "The Trolley Song".\n\nBorn Frances Ethel Gumm, Judy Garland first hit the stage at age 2, and never experienced a "normal" childhood or traditional relationship. Despite her immense talent, she was never able to find peace with the pressures of performing. Years of abuse led to an early death, not long after she finished her London run. The film never backs away from the tragic story, but also allows one of the brightest stars of an era to shine through. For those who only know Judy as that homesick girl from Kansas, or maybe also as the rosy-cheeked youngster on the Trolley in the holiday favorite MEET ME IN ST LOUIS (directed by her future husband Vincente Minnelli), there is likely a shock factor in seeing the broken icon in middle age. The film also deals with that always-present bond she had with her audience, especially with the gay community - although a certain sequence of the film seems quite improbable.\n\nFor a film like this to work (it was not sanctioned by Judy's daughter Liza Minnelli), it all rides on the lead performance. Renee Zellweger beautifully captures both the tragic essence and the stunning talent of the late 1960's Judy Garland, an iconic and revered entertainment figure. The film allows us to understand the lifelong mistreatment and heartbreak of this woman, as well as the strength and joy she received while performing live. Balancing the "early" Judy with the "later" Judy was a brilliant way of bringing her life full circle. Ms. Zellweger's performance goes so much deeper than singing on stage ... she embodies the insecurity and frailties of a woman who was never afforded the opportunity to live her own life.\n\nNOTE: There was a 2001 TV mini-series entitled "Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows", based on daughter Lorna Luft's memoir, in which Judy Davis (lip-synching to Ms. Garland's songs) delivered an impressive and Emmy winning performance.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45465,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"london england,concert,year 1968,ex husband ex wife relationship,sleeplessness","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing !?!?!

At the movie's beginning, we are informed that over 100,000 wild mustangs roam in the US, from which several hundreds are taken to prisons each year for training by inmates. The opening scenes bring us one of those round-ups, as a chopper is directing a herd of mustangs towards captivity. We are introduced to Roman, locked up (for what crime?) in a maximum security prison in Nevada. "I'm not good with people", he tells the reclassification officer, so she puts him in the outdoor maintenance program. Initially it's just cleaning up horse manure, but eventually he gets to work with one of the mustangs. In a parallel story, Roman is visited by his highly pregnant daughter, and their meeting is - strained...

She also co-wrote the script. She brings a multi-faceted story: yes, there is the redemption side where a hardened criminal finds new hope when bonding with a mustang, but there is also the complicated father-daughter angle (which surprised me on several occasions as that played out), and of course there is the aspect of life in prison. Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts was made to play the role of Roman: a very physical yet nuanced performance (in the same way that it reminded me of Marlon Brando--but I'm not saying that Schoenaerts is in the league of Brando!). Bruce Dern has a small role as the heard of the mustang training program. The photography is eye-candy from start to finish. And then there are the mustangs, themselves a character in the movie. In the end, the biggest treasure that was uncovered in this film may well be Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre. I can't wait to see what she will do next.

Had Pierre Curie not been killed as he was, it is likely that he would have eventually died of the effects of radiation, as did his wife, their daughter Irène, and her husband Frédéric Joliot.\n\nI'm a great fan of Rosamund Pike and enjoyed her performance in this very dull average film I suggest read the book or watch the far superior 1943 film with Greer Garson "Madam Curie." and Walter Pidgeon as Pierre.\n\nIt was nominated for 7 Oscars and a much better film directed by Mervyn LeRoy and based on Ève Curie the daughter of Madam Curie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15015,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-06-15","keywords":"scientist,physicist,science,physics,chemistry","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1577631257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUxMzMxYWQtZjM5Mi00ZGYzLTgyNzUtZWFjNDQ5NTliYjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUxMzMxYWQtZjM5Mi00ZGYzLTgyNzUtZWFjNDQ5NTliYjBmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"A story of the scientific and romantic passions of Marie Sklodowska-Curie (Polish scientist) and Pierre Curie, and the reverberation of their discoveries throughout the 20th century.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683253/","name":"Rosamund Pike","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275431/","name":"Yvette Feuer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1597296/","name":"Mirjam Novak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2277869/","name":"Marjane Satrapi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2113666/","name":"Jack Thorne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9706688/","name":"Lauren Redniss"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Will the brothers be triumphant","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0439123/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"chuck-526"},"dateCreated":"2011-11-17","inLanguage":"English","name":"1002 Arabian Nights, maybe","reviewBody":"This is a great fairy tale animation, both for kids and for "older kids"; it's among the best animations I've seen in the last decade. (I'm surprised it's not better known in the U.S., and suspect the issue is incomplete understanding of the language options, leading to the mis-conclusion that subtitles are necessary. -see below-) It's rather like another episode of "1001 Arabian Nights". Like any fairy tale, it plays fast and loose with time (16th century or 20th?) and place (Arabia or Persia?). There is no gore, very little blood, no glorification of violence, no double entendre talk (well one raised eyebrow once) ...and no "good guys" or animals die. Although it started out a bit slow and simple, I was soon pulled in so thoroughly I couldn't even contemplate pausing the DVD while I went to the bathroom.\n\nThe animation backgrounds appear to be typical 2D paintings, sometimes with multiple layers. Two things about the backgrounds stand out: First, they are highly detailed and variegated. And second, they use a lot of different strong colors at every opportunity - stained glass windows, meadow flowers, a spice market, dyed yarn, architectural tiles, geometric building decorations, etc. The magical figures appear to be 3D models, but so outrageously patterned and colored they're a feast for the eyes. The human figures also appear to be 3D models, but very simple ones, and in most cases projected as just simple flat areas of solid colors. Clothing mostly doesn't "drape", although flags, pennants, and sashes wave here and there.\n\nA couple effects are used especially well. One is the movement of point source lights. Walls and rooms subtly change color from one end to the other. Direct sunlight in the observatory is blinding. Fireflies light a scene. Darkened rooms gradually turn into brilliantly light ones as individual lights come on. And djinns cause showers of sparks. The other is swirling particles. Dust comes together into imagined figures (rather like seeing figures in the clouds). Fog envelops figures so thoroughly they disappear. A crystal prison shatters and the shards form an arch before disappearing.\n\nIn summary, the animation doesn't attempt to do 3D model animation better than Pixar, instead going off in a completely different direction. Rather than being clever and realistic, the animation flaunts its gorgeousness and the focus is on the story line. The figures are adequate to convey the story, but without any attempt to be marvels in their own right. Another difference from typical Pixar wannabes is there are no pop culture or current events references here; rather than presenting jokes every few tens of seconds, this animation relies simply on impeccable pacing of the story itself.\n\nThe "moral" of understanding diverse cultures and its benefits is hammered home again and again. Even the end credits call attention to the diverse cultures the animators came from.\n\nA perfectly serviceable English audio track exists; it was on the DVD I got from Netflix in late 2011. Younger viewers and others not comfortable with subtitles may find this the best way to make this animation accessible. The mismatch between mouth movements and the English audio is not distracting. This simpler view is complete and enjoyable; there's no need to understand any more.\n\nBut if you want to look a little deeper, it quickly becomes apparent that characters often switch between speaking French and speaking Arabic, sometimes even to different individuals in the same scene. Some of the jokes only halfway make sense if you're not aware of the language switches. And in a couple places the language switches are even relevant to the story line itself. Unless you know either French or Arabic, or have very quick ears, you may not be able to pick out all the language switches.

(I'm surprised it's not better known in the U.S., and suspect the issue is incomplete understanding of the language options, leading to the mis-conclusion that subtitles are necessary. -see below-) It's rather like another episode of "1001 Arabian Nights". Like any fairy tale, it plays fast and loose with time (16th century or 20th?) and place (Arabia or Persia?). There is no gore, very little blood, no glorification of violence, no double entendre talk (well one raised eyebrow once) ...and no "good guys" or animals die. Although it started out a bit slow and simple, I was soon pulled in so thoroughly I couldn't even contemplate pausing the DVD while I went to the bathroom.\n\nThe animation backgrounds appear to be typical 2D paintings, sometimes with multiple layers. Two things about the backgrounds stand out: First, they are highly detailed and variegated. And second, they use a lot of different strong colors at every opportunity - stained glass windows, meadow flowers, a spice market, dyed yarn, architectural tiles, geometric building decorations, etc. The magical figures appear to be 3D models, but so outrageously patterned and colored they're a feast for the eyes. The human figures also appear to be 3D models, but very simple ones, and in most cases projected as just simple flat areas of solid colors. Clothing mostly doesn't "drape", although flags, pennants, and sashes wave here and there.\n\nA couple effects are used especially well. One is the movement of point source lights. Walls and rooms subtly change color from one end to the other. Direct sunlight in the observatory is blinding. Fireflies light a scene. Darkened rooms gradually turn into brilliantly light ones as individual lights come on. And djinns cause showers of sparks. The other is swirling particles. Dust comes together into imagined figures (rather like seeing figures in the clouds). Fog envelops figures so thoroughly they disappear. A crystal prison shatters and the shards form an arch before disappearing.\n\nIn summary, the animation doesn't attempt to do 3D model animation better than Pixar, instead going off in a completely different direction. Rather than being clever and realistic, the animation flaunts its gorgeousness and the focus is on the story line. The figures are adequate to convey the story, but without any attempt to be marvels in their own right. Another difference from typical Pixar wannabes is there are no pop culture or current events references here; rather than presenting jokes every few tens of seconds, this animation relies simply on impeccable pacing of the story itself.\n\nThe "moral" of understanding diverse cultures and its benefits is hammered home again and again. Even the end credits call attention to the diverse cultures the animators came from.\n\nA perfectly serviceable English audio track exists; it was on the DVD I got from Netflix in late 2011. Younger viewers and others not comfortable with subtitles may find this the best way to make this animation accessible. The mismatch between mouth movements and the English audio is not distracting. This simpler view is complete and enjoyable; there's no need to understand any more.\n\nBut if you want to look a little deeper, it quickly becomes apparent that characters often switch between speaking French and speaking Arabic, sometimes even to different individuals in the same scene. Some of the jokes only halfway make sense if you're not aware of the language switches. And in a couple places the language switches are even relevant to the story line itself. Unless you know either French or Arabic, or have very quick ears, you may not be able to pick out all the language switches. The best way to understand them (for me at least) was to select "French" as the spoken language track and "English for the hearing impaired" (_not_ the regular "English") as the subtitle track. The "English for the hearing impaired" subtitles not only provide the dialog itself, but also indicate what language is being spoken. In fact, these subtitles are some of the best I've ever seen at conveying multi-lingual content.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3034,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2006-10-25","keywords":"racism,princess,nanny,lion,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3787964185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRkYjk4ZWUtOGE0ZC00OGQ2LWI3MWMtY2E4OTUwOTkzZDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRkYjk4ZWUtOGE0ZC00OGQ2LWI3MWMtY2E4OTUwOTkzZDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0969770/","name":"Cyril Mourali","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1947858/","name":"Karim M'Riba","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007814/","name":"Hiam Abbass"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0643664/","name":"Michel Ocelot"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085679/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102807/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036163/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0643664/","name":"Michel Ocelot"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The basketball player "big brother" Morris Chestnut worked well as a trouble gifted basketball player who reluctantly takes Bow Wow under his wings and albeit predictable softens up in his parental role with the youngster.  The scene where they paint geometry lessons on the side of his mansion was hilarious and keep up the importance of school!  Kids do the darnest things and I can see a youngster after a pair of magical shoes clinging to a tree in a thunderstorm.  Okay, as a parent thats dangerous and would not want to see my youngster dangling from this tree BUT I do remember my own exploits as a child doing much of the same type of daring challenges.  Kids will be kids so this gives excellent opportunity for the parent to talk with their child about keeping it safe!  The NBA should be elated to have been giving a more good-guy image then their typical bad boy look.  Very satisfied with this film portraying a positive image for my children to watch.

Was pleased seeing a young rapper placed in a non-stereotypical role that valued family and teamwork themes.  The basketball player "big brother" Morris Chestnut worked well as a trouble gifted basketball player who reluctantly takes Bow Wow under his wings and albeit predictable softens up in his parental role with the youngster.  The scene where they paint geometry lessons on the side of his mansion was hilarious and keep up the importance of school!  Kids do the darnest things and I can see a youngster after a pair of magical shoes clinging to a tree in a thunderstorm.  Okay, as a parent thats dangerous and would not want to see my youngster dangling from this tree BUT I do remember my own exploits as a child doing much of the same type of daring challenges.  Kids will be kids so this gives excellent opportunity for the parent to talk with their child about keeping it safe!  The NBA should be elated to have been giving a more good-guy image then their typical bad boy look.  Very satisfied with this film portraying a positive image for my children to watch.

As it turns out, the flock exists and is headed by Jewel's long lost father Eduardo (Andy Garcia) and guarded by her old flame Roberto (Bruno Mars).

It's been tunneling through a gold mine ever since. While Rio 2 might seem like a cash cow for some viewers, it is still a delightful animation with foot-tapping music to get your groove on.

It's not supposed to be "To Kill A Mockingbird" -- it's a fun experience.\n\nStephen Sondhemim's songs are stellar: "Back in Business" is energetic, "Sooner or Later" is just right, "What Can You Lose" is haunting -- even tunes like "Live Alone and Like It" add to the story\n\nGot to love the giddily over-the-top performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Headly, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, supporting villains...

The excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes "A Grand Day Out," "The Wrong Trousers," and also "A Close Shave" some of the best animated footage ever put on television. Winning several Oscars and also countless other awards, Nick Park became quite the popular man in the U.K., yet his impact on the United States has not been big. After the third Wallace and Gromit short, there was all this speculation about a full-length Wallace and Gromit movie, yet for years nothing had happened. Then in 2000 instead of a full-length Wallace and Gromit film, we get another brilliant claymation film from Nick Park, which was Chicken Run, which almost got nominated for best picture in the Academy Awards. Perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove Park to finally work on a Wallace and Gromit project.\n\n5 years later (these kinds of films do take long you know) and a lot of anticipation, Wallace and Gromit finally hits the big screen. Despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this movie delivers in so many ways. This film will be a delight for both kids and parents. With tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults. This rather difficult technique is one that only Pixar has already perfected and DreamWorks has had a lot of trouble doing lately. Despite the DreamWorks logo slapped onto the poster, this film is mainly from the very creative staff of Aardman Animations.\n\nWallace and Gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople's crops from being ruined by rabbits, which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately. Their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection. Complications arise when Wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople. To add to that, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of Victor. Simple plot yes, but there is more than meets the eye, be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way, kind of like in the other Wallace and Gromit cartoons.\n\nIn animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film. Despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage, the payoff is fantastic. There is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice. Even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film. Whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible, or it is the oh-so-adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film, most Curse of the Were-Rabbit's humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late. Just picture the movie Madagascar, except funnier much fewer pop culture references, and better animation.\n\nCasting was great, even though in a film with not much dialogue, it was not that important. Peter Sallis yet again does a wonderful job as Wallace, even though in this movie there was no stand-out quote that can be used anytime (The Wrong Trousers: "It's the wrong trousers Gromit, and they've gone wrong!"). Ralph Fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain Victor and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit "Fight Club") lends her lovely voice as she plays Wallace's love interest. Even though nothing could top the final chase in "The Wrong Trousers," Curse of the Ware-Rabbit did have plenty of action scenes, including one fantastically done chase scene between Gromit and Victor's evil dog. Last but not least, the rabbits really steal the show at some moments. Whether it is their cute expressions, their funny movements, or their howling, the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars. The funniest rabbit in the movie is the "cursed" rabbit himself, to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter.\n\nBottom Line: Despite not being as memorable as "The Wrong Trousers", this film is just as good and entertaining as Chicken Run. Unlike almost every movie to come out this year, the movie does not drag at all, clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun, it will leave everyone watching it asking for more. There is very little wrong with the film; it was a pure delight to watch. This film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar, uncut, raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-Year-Old Virgin, Wedding Crashers, and Sin City) and for families and those who want harmless entertainment; that is a good thing. Highly recommend, this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade.

As the director states in the bonus audio track, the production team did not identify and write to a "target market" when developing the screen writing, they did not follow the dreary Hollywood "recipe" for film-making, and, most importantly, they did use non-actors to portray almost all the lead and back-up roles. \n\nTinle, the lead character, is a treasure. The first time I viewed the movie, I thought, 'what a wonderful actor.' His timing is exact yet unpredictable, his personality forceful, his face is exquisite, his form unique and authentic. A natural, I thought. Indeed, he plays himself in a quasi-autobiography, and what a wonderful character he is.\n\nThis is a movie about an ancient civilization we are losing and, sadly, will soon be lost. Really, its a documentary, and, as the director states, will certainly be used by future historians as a visual artifact of what is soon to become the lost Dolpo civilization of Nepal. The soundtrack conditions you to this heartbreaking reality.\n\nThe movie is successful on many levels: a mother's lost love (who hasn't seen her adult child since he was eight); a loving grandfather/grandson relationship, which is painfully lost; a wife who loses her husband, and a young boy who loses his father then attempts to make sense out of the loss; a young religious man who chooses the 'difficult' path over the easy monastic life; a classic confrontation between generations; and an old man whose entire life is built on strength, perseverance, and admiration, but then who ultimately must let go of it all to those who are destined to succeed him.\n\nI loved this movie. It made me think of my mother, an artist, whom I miss dearly. Himalaya is a work of art.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1999-12-15","keywords":"nepal,buddhism,himalayas,salt,caravan","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Himalaya","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2494365977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0YjQ5YjMtNTE2Yi00ODJlLTllMDctMWE5Yjk5ZGJhNTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0YjQ5YjMtNTE2Yi00ODJlLTllMDctMWE5Yjk5ZGJhNTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0508303/","name":"Thilen Lhondup"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477312/","name":"Gurgon Kyap"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874661/","name":"Lhakpa Tsamchoe"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0885108/","name":"Eric Valli"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213340/","name":"Michel Debats"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058643/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013404/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0044383/","name":"Nathalie Azoulai"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206797/","name":"Olivier Dazat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0306627/","name":"Louis Gardel"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When his son dies returning from Tibet's salt lakes, Tinle blames Karma, his son's friend, refuses to give Karma his blessing as the new chief, and organizes a rival caravan to take the salt to lower Nepal to trade for grain. He, a few old men, his son's widow, his grandson, and his second son, a monk, set out on the arduous journey. Fearing storms, Karma has led his caravan out of the village before the auspicious day ordained by the lamas. Tinle's group catches Karma's before the final pass; the two stubborn men lock wills with Tinle's grandson watching." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0210727/","name":"Himalaya - l'enfance d'un chef","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTE4YWQxODUtNjE3Ni00MDExLTljZGEtYmU4N2U3MmU1OWZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTMxODk2OTU@._V1_.jpg","description":"An aging chief's last stand, lessons for the new, and the education of a young chief-to-be played against harsh Nature in Nepal's Dolpo.

As the director states in the bonus audio track, the production team did not identify and write to a "target market" when developing the screen writing, they did not follow the dreary Hollywood "recipe" for film-making, and, most importantly, they did use non-actors to portray almost all the lead and back-up roles. \n\nTinle, the lead character, is a treasure. The first time I viewed the movie, I thought, 'what a wonderful actor.' His timing is exact yet unpredictable, his personality forceful, his face is exquisite, his form unique and authentic. A natural, I thought. Indeed, he plays himself in a quasi-autobiography, and what a wonderful character he is.\n\nThis is a movie about an ancient civilization we are losing and, sadly, will soon be lost. Really, its a documentary, and, as the director states, will certainly be used by future historians as a visual artifact of what is soon to become the lost Dolpo civilization of Nepal. The soundtrack conditions you to this heartbreaking reality.\n\nThe movie is successful on many levels: a mother's lost love (who hasn't seen her adult child since he was eight); a loving grandfather/grandson relationship, which is painfully lost; a wife who loses her husband, and a young boy who loses his father then attempts to make sense out of the loss; a young religious man who chooses the 'difficult' path over the easy monastic life; a classic confrontation between generations; and an old man whose entire life is built on strength, perseverance, and admiration, but then who ultimately must let go of it all to those who are destined to succeed him.\n\nI loved this movie. It made me think of my mother, an artist, whom I miss dearly. Himalaya is a work of art.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1999-12-15","keywords":"nepal,buddhism,himalayas,salt,caravan","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Himalaya","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2494365977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0YjQ5YjMtNTE2Yi00ODJlLTllMDctMWE5Yjk5ZGJhNTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0YjQ5YjMtNTE2Yi00ODJlLTllMDctMWE5Yjk5ZGJhNTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0508303/","name":"Thilen Lhondup","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477312/","name":"Gurgon Kyap","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874661/","name":"Lhakpa Tsamchoe"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0885108/","name":"Eric Valli","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213340/","name":"Michel Debats"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058643/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013404/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0044383/","name":"Nathalie Azoulai","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206797/","name":"Olivier Dazat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0306627/","name":"Louis Gardel"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His major peculiarity was that he undertook this journey with the unwavering support of his screenwriter wife Huguette Boisvert who made sure that proper emphasis was placed on the importance of marital relations, no matter how depraved the surroundings !\n\nThe blandly titled NAKED LOVERS (original French title : LA FILLE A LA FOURRURE) proves a delightfully brain-fried mix of lowbrow sci fi thrills and graphic sex. Just as they are about to consummate their union, a pair of newly weds (Alain Saury and Ursula White) are astonished to spot the husband's dead first wife (voluptuous German sex starlet turned French fornication film superstar Barbara Moose) staring through the window. Well, you certainly would be, wouldn't you ? Rather than going for the bizarre spectacle of boinking zombies though (for which I'll direct you towards Joe D'Amato's EROTIC NIGHTS OF THE LIVING DEAD), the plot gives us aliens - from the planet Eros, naturally - taking over the bodies of our recently deceased to mingle unnoticed (?) with mankind and hump a few comely specimens in the process. Highlight of this atmospherically photographed yet supremely silly skin flick is a cast-inclusive daisy chain group grope in a moonlit forest, with synchronized position changes to boot !","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1978-01-25","keywords":"alien,possessed,erotica,softcore,sex","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041425/","name":"Didier Aubriot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767062/","name":"Alain Saury"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0162792/","name":"Ursula White"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0682749/","name":"Claude Pierson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109054/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060888/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092407/","name":"Huguette Boisvert"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His major peculiarity was that he undertook this journey with the unwavering support of his screenwriter wife Huguette Boisvert who made sure that proper emphasis was placed on the importance of marital relations, no matter how depraved the surroundings !\n\nThe blandly titled NAKED LOVERS (original French title : LA FILLE A LA FOURRURE) proves a delightfully brain-fried mix of lowbrow sci fi thrills and graphic sex. Just as they are about to consummate their union, a pair of newly weds (Alain Saury and Ursula White) are astonished to spot the husband's dead first wife (voluptuous German sex starlet turned French fornication film superstar Barbara Moose) staring through the window. Well, you certainly would be, wouldn't you ? Rather than going for the bizarre spectacle of boinking zombies though (for which I'll direct you towards Joe D'Amato's EROTIC NIGHTS OF THE LIVING DEAD), the plot gives us aliens - from the planet Eros, naturally - taking over the bodies of our recently deceased to mingle unnoticed (?) with mankind and hump a few comely specimens in the process. Highlight of this atmospherically photographed yet supremely silly skin flick is a cast-inclusive daisy chain group grope in a moonlit forest, with synchronized position changes to boot !","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1978-01-25","keywords":"alien,possessed,erotica,softcore,sex","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041425/","name":"Didier Aubriot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767062/","name":"Alain Saury","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0162792/","name":"Ursula White"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0682749/","name":"Claude Pierson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109054/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060888/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092407/","name":"Huguette Boisvert"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's however a very different cake he's baked this time. The frenetic unfolding of events in "Truands" makes place for a slow moving, basically simple story revealing itself.

And if you are, then know that my review is based on my fandom and in relation to the series itself. Therefore, it will be in the context of horror films, slasher films, and more importantly, the series itself. With that out of the way, who would have though the fifth film would be the one. Ever since the original, the series has sort of meandered around, trying to recapture the initial wonder of death playing the part of a slasher and killing off a group of people. \n\nYes, Final Destination 5 is truly the best sequel since the first. There hasn't been this much tension and creativity since the original, and practically every scene is filled with an uncomfortable level of anxiety. This is what the film has truly been missing, whether spoiled by the trailers before it or just a lack of creativity. For the most part, Final Destination 3 and 4 (TFD) lacked the necessary level of creativity and menace that was present in the first film, and even in the second. However, we have plenty of that here and a few nice twists as well. While the kills are also pretty ridiculous, most are plausible and, unlike TFD, should please fans with their level of gore and brutality.\n\nThe filmmaking qualities here reach above the standard the film has set. It looks great, with plenty of swift and enticing editing that will make your skin crawl with anticipation. The acting, while still not of any award winning caliber, or even really all that great, is decent enough here. The portrayals are more realistic this time around. While the film had though to settle into the I-found-the-answers-on-the-internet routine, here we have a smooth flow in which characters sort of lose their mind trying to figure things out. And while some might have called the main couple's relationship cringe worthy, I actually found it to be quite well played out as the couple has real issues they work through on top of everything that's going on. Suffice to say, it's nice to see the FD series making better attempts at developing it's characters. Still not great, but better.\n\nWith that said, this is Final Destination, and problems persist. Despite better attempts at character development, the majority still play fodder for death's machinations. Sure, we learn a little about them, but it's not any more than the bare minimum: this guys a jerk, that girls wild, etc etc. There is also one kill, in particular, that, while brutal, defies logic. Sure, it's FD, but there is a certain point of ridiculousness where the line is drawn. The characters trying to figure out what's going on is also getting old. There's certainly a reason here, which I won't spoil, why our characters don't know about what is happening in the same way characters from previous films know. But this leads to the problem of it being explained too quickly. This might contradict what I said above, but what I mean is that Tony Todd's character if far too quick to reveal information and the new twist. In comparison to FD1, where things had a slow, natural pacing, here we get a couple death scenes, and explanation, and then more death scenes. The progression is better, but still not as good as the first two films. \n\nFans will truly enjoy this solid sequel. There are a couple twists, and the final scene will blow everyone away. It's beyond what you would expect, and very nearly worth seeing the film alone. But with a handful of creative and brutal twists and a decently put together film, this should certainly warrant a decent box office and, maybe unfortunately, another sequel or two."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110636,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-08-12","keywords":"suspension bridge,gymnast,death of protagonist,eyeball run over by car,fall out window","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3590233113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Survivors of a suspension bridge collapse frantically work together to try and outwit Death and its sinister agenda."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194900/","name":"Nicholas D'Agosto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068187/","name":"Emma Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0260224/","name":"Arlen Escarpeta"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702797/","name":"Steven Quale"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0236019/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2104063/","name":"Eric Heisserer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714695/","name":"Jeffrey Reddick"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For the most part, Final Destination 3 and 4 (TFD) lacked the necessary level of creativity and menace that was present in the first film, and even in the second. However, we have plenty of that here and a few nice twists as well. While the kills are also pretty ridiculous, most are plausible and, unlike TFD, should please fans with their level of gore and brutality.\n\nThe filmmaking qualities here reach above the standard the film has set. It looks great, with plenty of swift and enticing editing that will make your skin crawl with anticipation. The acting, while still not of any award winning caliber, or even really all that great, is decent enough here. The portrayals are more realistic this time around. While the film had though to settle into the I-found-the-answers-on-the-internet routine, here we have a smooth flow in which characters sort of lose their mind trying to figure things out. And while some might have called the main couple's relationship cringe worthy, I actually found it to be quite well played out as the couple has real issues they work through on top of everything that's going on. Suffice to say, it's nice to see the FD series making better attempts at developing it's characters. Still not great, but better.\n\nWith that said, this is Final Destination, and problems persist. Despite better attempts at character development, the majority still play fodder for death's machinations. Sure, we learn a little about them, but it's not any more than the bare minimum: this guys a jerk, that girls wild, etc etc. There is also one kill, in particular, that, while brutal, defies logic. Sure, it's FD, but there is a certain point of ridiculousness where the line is drawn. The characters trying to figure out what's going on is also getting old. There's certainly a reason here, which I won't spoil, why our characters don't know about what is happening in the same way characters from previous films know. But this leads to the problem of it being explained too quickly. This might contradict what I said above, but what I mean is that Tony Todd's character if far too quick to reveal information and the new twist. In comparison to FD1, where things had a slow, natural pacing, here we get a couple death scenes, and explanation, and then more death scenes. The progression is better, but still not as good as the first two films. \n\nFans will truly enjoy this solid sequel. There are a couple twists, and the final scene will blow everyone away. It's beyond what you would expect, and very nearly worth seeing the film alone. But with a handful of creative and brutal twists and a decently put together film, this should certainly warrant a decent box office and, maybe unfortunately, another sequel or two.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110636,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-08-12","keywords":"suspension bridge,gymnast,death of protagonist,eyeball run over by car,fall out window","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3590233113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Survivors of a suspension bridge collapse frantically work together to try and outwit Death and its sinister agenda.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194900/","name":"Nicholas D'Agosto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068187/","name":"Emma Bell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0260224/","name":"Arlen Escarpeta"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702797/","name":"Steven Quale"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0236019/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2104063/","name":"Eric Heisserer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714695/","name":"Jeffrey Reddick"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Writer/director/actor Edward Norton paid homage to the classics in this movie. Featuring an All-Star cast, there was no way he could lose with the characters' performances. I think that is the one drawback of the film, with such a stellar cast he had to give everyone time and the movie boasts a runtime of 2:24 minutes. A bit lengthy for a crime drama/who done it because there will be slower portions of the film. However, it was never boring and the dialogue is spot-on with the snappiness of Sin City but it doesn't come across as a caricature.

Writer/director/actor Edward Norton paid homage to the classics in this movie. Featuring an All-Star cast, there was no way he could lose with the characters' performances. I think that is the one drawback of the film, with such a stellar cast he had to give everyone time and the movie boasts a runtime of 2:24 minutes. A bit lengthy for a crime drama/who done it because there will be slower portions of the film. However, it was never boring and the dialogue is spot-on with the snappiness of Sin City but it doesn't come across as a caricature.

Nolan has outdone himself !!","reviewBody":"What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?\n\nDom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!\n\nBut then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'\n\nThen what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a "forger" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. \n\nThere is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.\n\nLeonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.\n\nTo conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! \n\nMy Rating: 10/10\n\nThanks &amp; Regards","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2165826,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?\n\nDom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!\n\nBut then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'\n\nThen what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a "forger" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. \n\nThere is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.\n\nLeonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.\n\nTo conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! \n\nMy Rating: 10/10\n\nThanks &amp; Regards","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2165826,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I feel this movie is a victim of the studio going wild with a pair of scissors, trying to make it short(er) (even at 2 hours) to please the mainstream audience, but while doing that, this movie loses a lot of substance.

The movie also takes place in the late 80's(?) or early 90's, but I don't feel like time was important here, which makes things a little confusing. I have no idea if they've been at something for a week, a month, or five years. \n\nThe whole movie also feels a little rushed in the sense that it tries to get to the end as quickly as possible. It lacks the details; Slow down a little, speak to us, breathe.

This is one for those who love their European cinema with a Gallic twist - recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1717,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-24","keywords":"fan,singer,beautician,f rated,text messaging","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452161/","name":"Sandrine Kiberlain","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0480850/","name":"Laurent Lafitte","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0218615/","name":"Pascal Demolon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0380831/","name":"Jeanne Herry"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044413/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0365291/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0380831/","name":"Jeanne Herry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1342890/","name":"Gaëlle Macé"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.\n\nWe first see Richard (played by Paul Walter Hauser in one of the year's best performances) as a supply clerk at a law firm in 1986. His awkward ways and surprising efficiency catches the eye of attorney Watson Bryant (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell), a quasi-connection that comes into play a decade later. We then jump ahead those 10 years to find Richard being fired from his campus security job at a college due to his over-zealous focus on protocol. Fortunately for Richard, the Olympics are coming to Atlanta, so finding work as a security guard is pretty easy.\n\nAtlanta's Centennial Olympic Park is shown with crowds of people cheering at a Kenny Rogers and later dancing the Macarena. As one of the on-site security guards, Richard spots a suspicious backpack that turns out to be holding the bomb that detonates, creating tragedy for many. As the viewing audience, we know that Richard's actions saved lives and he most definitely was not responsible for planting the bomb. And it's that knowing that places us as close as possible to the Richard Jewell experience.\n\nFour-time Oscar winner Clint Eastwood directs yet another story of a working-class hero. Only this time, he blatantly calls out what he sees as two evil forces: the U.S. Government (the FBI) and the media. Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, SHATTERED GLASS) based his script on the 1997 Vanity Fair article "American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell" by Marie Brenner (who also wrote the article that was the source for THE INSIDER, 1999). It can be argued that Eastwood comes down hard on the FBI and the media, but you might consider putting yourself in Richard Jewell's shoes before crying foul.\n\nJon Hamm has perfected the role of cocksure FBI agent and here he plays Tom Shaw as the man totally focused on proving Richard Jewell was the perpetrator. Much has been made of Eastwood's depiction of Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde, who directed this year's surprise hit BOOKSMART). It's a bit curious that the uproar is over what some interpret as a reporter trading intimate relations for a scoop, yet Eastwood's contempt seems focused more on the idea of trying a citizen's case in public ... while lacking any real evidence outside of a profile. The reporter (Ms. Scruggs passed away in 2001) is certainly portrayed as an ultra-aggressive reporter desperate for a headline story, but the implied consensual affair occurred after the inside information was provided - and the FBI agent was actually surprised... "Is this really going to happen?" Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.\n\nTwo key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right.

Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.\n\nWe first see Richard (played by Paul Walter Hauser in one of the year's best performances) as a supply clerk at a law firm in 1986. His awkward ways and surprising efficiency catches the eye of attorney Watson Bryant (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell), a quasi-connection that comes into play a decade later. We then jump ahead those 10 years to find Richard being fired from his campus security job at a college due to his over-zealous focus on protocol. Fortunately for Richard, the Olympics are coming to Atlanta, so finding work as a security guard is pretty easy.\n\nAtlanta's Centennial Olympic Park is shown with crowds of people cheering at a Kenny Rogers and later dancing the Macarena. As one of the on-site security guards, Richard spots a suspicious backpack that turns out to be holding the bomb that detonates, creating tragedy for many. As the viewing audience, we know that Richard's actions saved lives and he most definitely was not responsible for planting the bomb. And it's that knowing that places us as close as possible to the Richard Jewell experience.\n\nFour-time Oscar winner Clint Eastwood directs yet another story of a working-class hero. Only this time, he blatantly calls out what he sees as two evil forces: the U.S. Government (the FBI) and the media. Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, SHATTERED GLASS) based his script on the 1997 Vanity Fair article "American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell" by Marie Brenner (who also wrote the article that was the source for THE INSIDER, 1999). It can be argued that Eastwood comes down hard on the FBI and the media, but you might consider putting yourself in Richard Jewell's shoes before crying foul.\n\nJon Hamm has perfected the role of cocksure FBI agent and here he plays Tom Shaw as the man totally focused on proving Richard Jewell was the perpetrator. Much has been made of Eastwood's depiction of Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde, who directed this year's surprise hit BOOKSMART). It's a bit curious that the uproar is over what some interpret as a reporter trading intimate relations for a scoop, yet Eastwood's contempt seems focused more on the idea of trying a citizen's case in public ... while lacking any real evidence outside of a profile. The reporter (Ms. Scruggs passed away in 2001) is certainly portrayed as an ultra-aggressive reporter desperate for a headline story, but the implied consensual affair occurred after the inside information was provided - and the FBI agent was actually surprised... "Is this really going to happen?" Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.\n\nTwo key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right. A rush to judgment can be seen as an abuse of power, whether it's by the media, a law enforcement agency, or folks on social media. At this stage of his career, director Eastwood seems more interested in telling stories than showing one. He offers up little visual artistry outside of the terrific performances, but this story ... it's a doozy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74442,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

CA., CALI, Colombia &amp; ORLANDO, FL\n\nIf you are among the millions of people who enjoy films with Jodie Foster We have good news!.... Ms. Foster really takes off in this entertaining cinematic offering in the sky! A good deal of time has passed since we saw her in Panic Room (2002), but for my taste, this FLIGHTPLAN proves itself as an even better vehicle to showcase her talent. The movie demonstrates similitude to a Hitchcock thriller from the golden age of Hollywood, both in style and in its storyline development. Guaranteed to keep you in respiratory crisis almost from start to finish! In the role of Kyle Pratt, aircraft engine engineer and mother of 6 year old Katerina, Foster shows tremendous range of nuanced emotion, in a performance that easily could have given her a fifth Oscar nomination. FLIGHTPLAN has a very smooth take-off, but does not take long to encounter serious turbulence.\n\nSoon after boarding an international flight, Kyle falls asleep, with her daughter alongside her. Upon waking, she discovers that Katerina, apparently, has disappeared without leaving so much as the slightest trace! Progressively, Jody Foster shows us an entire catalog of emotions. Concern and nervousness, followed sequentially by frustration; anguish and despair; then confusion and guilt; which ultimately give way to stoic resignation and unsettling doubts about her own sanity. The primary secret of FIGHTPLAN's success is that it enables the viewer to experience some of these emotions simultaneously right along with its lead character.\n\nUnfortunately, there is one black hole in the skies of FLIGHTPLAN. It's the kind of vacuum that prevents a "good" movie from being an absolutely phenomenal one! Without flying into any spoilers by divulging anything specific as to the identity of the on board bad guy(s), I will share the following with you: The team responsible for creating FLIGHTPLAN, in an extremely odd and inexplicable decision, chose not to reveal the slightest clue as to any of the background, history, formation, training, experience, MOTIVATION (outside of the $$$), previous or present internal conflicts, mental state and developmental thought processes of the villain(s)!\n\nThis lapse is even more striking when contrasted with the background provided for protagonist Jodie Foster's character, Kyle, whose personality is meticulously constructed, with deliberation and great attention to detail. Because of this, the bad guy(s) end-up projecting a kind of "Terminator-Light" image, seemingly lifted straight out of a comic book, thusly rendering the viewer totally indifferent to their intervention or plight in the film! The cast of FLIGHTPLAN, in general, submit solid and credible portrayals. Peter Sarsgaard, a veteran actor who has participated in numerous films, but who always has remained a bit under the radar in Hollywood, appears in a supporting role. His part is the most important one after Ms. Foster's. Sarsgaard's interpretation of a "Marshall" (a kind of national airways police) seems somewhat enigmatic and secretive.\n\nBess Wohl, who plays daughter, Katerina, has not had much on-screen experience, but is competent in her role as innocent child victim. As the pilot, we have Sean Bean, in a refreshing change of pace role. Most certainly recognizable owing to his turns as villain in several high profile films. He is quite convincing as the crew chief who gradually loses patience with a passenger who proves to be simply too problematic.\n\nIn 2005, few films managed to stay on top of box office for two consecutive weeks. This distinction is well-deserved in the case of FLIGHTPLAN, which was assigned a "PG -13" rating. It seems a great option for families with children over 8 or 9. For small kids, especially if they might feel anxious about a little girl forcibly abducted from her mother, do a pre-screening 7.5*....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!

That said, thirty years before "Nos Jours Heureux", Claude Millers' debut film "La Meilleure Façon De Marcher" (1976) used this type of place as a backdrop to depict an ambiguous relationship between two counselors who were admirably portrayed by Patrick Deweare and Patrick Bouchitey. And at a pinch, one could also quote Gérard Jugnot's "Scout Toujours..." (1985).\n\nBut here, it's a true children's holiday camp that is depicted here. Set in 1992, a manager Vincent (Jean Paul Rouve) has to run a children's holiday camp for three weeks and to face the unexpected concerning the place, his colleagues, various problems linked to children about the rooms, trips, their belongings. Very often, what seem at first little problems end up becoming great ones which can sometimes be solved in a curious and humorist way.\n\nBecause it's the tone used by the two directors to relate these crazy three weeks. I must admit it's a shame they have recourse to clichés to depict several types of counselors between shy Caroline, seducing Lisa who doesn't leave Vincent indifferent, big mouth Daniel. OK, these stereotypes are the motors to several comical sequences but I would have liked more originality. The same goes for the kids between the witty one, the anguished one who keeps on asking a thousand questions about all and nothing. And of course, girls are one of their biggest interests during their holidays.\n\nThat said, the energy of the actors, the nostalgic look adopted by the directors, the funny ways big problems are solved or circumvented are enough to honestly have fun and to spend a really good time in front of this vibrant comedy although it is cluttered with clichés. But as they're not too overwhelming, one can forget them without any remorse. One will also forget a too cozy end.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3625,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"young love,summer vacation,summer camp,train,summer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4043619865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0OTA3N2QtZTcwMi00NjliLTgzM2ItNzFlNTg1MTkxNDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0OTA3N2QtZTcwMi00NjliLTgzM2ItNzFlNTg1MTkxNDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0077622/","name":"Marilou Berry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1082477/","name":"Omar Sy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619923/","name":"Olivier Nakache"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865918/","name":"Éric Toledano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098808/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069340/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006560/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619923/","name":"Olivier Nakache"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865918/","name":"Éric Toledano"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Buck is an extremely likeable protagonist who goes on a compelling journey of self discovery. Despite being a dog and not having a word of dialogue, Buck is an incredibly interesting, three dimensional character with a well developed arc. The CGI used to bring him to life is amazing. While it doesn't always look natural, Buck's CGI model is so expressive and can cause the viewer to experience a variety of different emotions, despite not even being there. Harrison Ford also does well as the elderly, depressed John Thornton, carrying a great deal of tragedy and mystery about his past throughout the movie. The movie also features stunning cinematography, with several beautiful shots and camera angles. It's a true joy to look at. However, there are a few problems with the movie. For starters, John Thornton narrates a lot throughout the movie, despite not being present for, and therefore having no way of knowing about, the events that he's describing. Another issue is Dan Stevens' character; Hal. Hal is an entirely unnecessary, one dimensional antagonist, who just doesn't work with the story this movie is trying to tell. His presence also completely derails John Thornton's resolution. However, despite these problems, I still recommend The Call Of The Wild. It's a fantastic movie, with an incredible protagonist and stunningly beautiful visuals that you shouldn't miss.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43688,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2020-02-21","keywords":"1890s,remake,alaska,snow,dog","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi264945433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRjNGU1MDItMDcyZC00ZTNmLWI1Y2ItN2Q1NjE5YmQ5Yzg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRjNGU1MDItMDcyZC00ZTNmLWI1Y2ItN2Q1NjE5YmQ5Yzg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A sled dog struggles for survival in the Alaskan wild."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1082477/","name":"Omar Sy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4446254/","name":"Cara Gee"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0781821/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172422/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0518711/","name":"Jack London"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10950558/","name":"Egerton Ryerson Young"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Buck is an extremely likeable protagonist who goes on a compelling journey of self discovery. Despite being a dog and not having a word of dialogue, Buck is an incredibly interesting, three dimensional character with a well developed arc. The CGI used to bring him to life is amazing. While it doesn't always look natural, Buck's CGI model is so expressive and can cause the viewer to experience a variety of different emotions, despite not even being there. Harrison Ford also does well as the elderly, depressed John Thornton, carrying a great deal of tragedy and mystery about his past throughout the movie. The movie also features stunning cinematography, with several beautiful shots and camera angles. It's a true joy to look at. However, there are a few problems with the movie. For starters, John Thornton narrates a lot throughout the movie, despite not being present for, and therefore having no way of knowing about, the events that he's describing. Another issue is Dan Stevens' character; Hal. Hal is an entirely unnecessary, one dimensional antagonist, who just doesn't work with the story this movie is trying to tell. His presence also completely derails John Thornton's resolution. However, despite these problems, I still recommend The Call Of The Wild. It's a fantastic movie, with an incredible protagonist and stunningly beautiful visuals that you shouldn't miss.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43688,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2020-02-21","keywords":"1890s,remake,alaska,snow,dog","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi264945433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRjNGU1MDItMDcyZC00ZTNmLWI1Y2ItN2Q1NjE5YmQ5Yzg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRjNGU1MDItMDcyZC00ZTNmLWI1Y2ItN2Q1NjE5YmQ5Yzg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A sled dog struggles for survival in the Alaskan wild.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1082477/","name":"Omar Sy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4446254/","name":"Cara Gee"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0781821/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172422/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0518711/","name":"Jack London","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10950558/","name":"Egerton Ryerson Young"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Every once in a while, particularly during summer months when studios are rolling out their blockbuster hopefuls, you'll see a couple of movies released that seem to be mirror images of one-another. Not exactly the same, but similar enough that it seems like they must have some common ancestor.\n\nThe reason why this happens is pretty straight forward and has to do with the unusual way the movie industry works. Often, the scripts for movies aren't developed in-house by the studios, but rather purchased from freelance writers who come up with an idea and then "pitch" it to multiple studios looking for a buyer.\n\nThe process works for both the writers and the studios. There is a catch, however, which is that the person pitching relies upon a studio honoring an informal agreement not to use an idea without compensating the creator. The problem is that less scrupulous studio executives will have no problem passing on an idea and then blatantly copying it for their own movie. And even though everyone involved knows what's happening, it's pretty rare for anyone to actually sue over it, so it tends to keep happening.\n\nA famous example of this (famous in the relative sense) happened with the movies 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. The original author who pitched 'Deep Impact' watched a studio exec take copious notes during the pitch, pass on it, and then rush to create a script and get his ripped off version made in time to compete with 'Deep Impact', which was purchased by another studio.\n\nThis usually happens when someone creates a script that captures the zeitgeist; that taps into an idea that just clicks with what people are talking and thinking about and it becomes the "must have" idea of the year.\n\nUnless you're an industry insider, it can be difficult to know which movie was the original concept and which was the ripoff, but generally the original idea will be more polished and well thought out. 'Armageddon', for example, famously had such huge plot holes that the cast was complaining about them during filming.\n\n'Olympus Has Fallen' (OHF) came out around the same time as 'White House Down' (WHD). Both movies feature an attack on the white house with an invading force, aided by a turncoat secret service agent, conquering the presidential security in an attempt to take him hostage. Both movies also have a protagonist who isn't secret service, but has some connection to the agency and ultimately proves that he deserves to be guarding the president. Both movies involve protecting a child caught in the crossfire. Both have failed attempts by special forces to re-take the building. Both involve explosions that destroy the building. Both movies involve forcing a change to foreign policy. And so on, you get the idea.\n\nI don't know which was the original, but I have a guess. The movies were made during the presidency of Barack Obama. After he was elected, there was a lot of speculation about whether he would be the subject of an assassination attempt. To African Americans Obama represented an almost unbelievable event: one of their own elected to the most powerful office in the nation. And there was a great deal of angst about losing him violently, the way a number of prominent black leaders had been lost in the past. I think that was the kernel that sparked the original screenplay; this clash of the old power base and the new one in the symbolic seat of national power.\n\nTo my mind, WHD was the liberal take on the idea while OHF was the conservative counter. WHD featured a charismatic black president clearly modeled after Obama, right down to his attempts to quit smoking. The villains are white supremacist types backed by the old-guard military industrial complex who are fearful of the changes the president was making to foreign policy. And the protagonist is a millennial trying to prove he was worthy of the responsibility of protecting the president, perhaps an analogy for the young political activists that brought new methods of campaigning to Obama's election.\n\nOHF, by contrast, features a white male president with villains who were almost exclusively Asian, and rather than representing the supporters of the status quo they are actively looking to tear down American force abroad, suggesting that the bad guys can't stand how effective the traditional American foreign policy is. In other words, the message is "we are winning and they are getting desperate". Even the protagonist is more representative of the target audience: a middle-aged man with a penchant for defiantly vowing to destroy the villains and defend our way of life.\n\nNeither movie is particularly deep; it's mostly about the action sequences. In other words, these are popcorn movies. But I do think it's interesting how two such similar base ideas can manifest such different messages. While WHD is about the (then) rising tide of the progressive political movement and the supposed fear within groups that traditionally held power in the US, OHF is all about the traditional conservative message of Jingoism and the need to protect ourselves from the parts of the world that don't share our values.\n\nWhatever the case may be, OHF was successful enough to green light a second film 'London Has Fallen', which is a continuation of the themes, only with (primarily) middle-eastern villains instead of Asian ones, and an upcoming 'Angel Has Fallen'. Personally, I thought OHF was decent but unspectacular. I enjoyed it enough when I saw it on HBO or Netflix or wherever, but I probably wouldn't pay to see it in the theater.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"politics,political thriller,u.s. president,political assassination,white house","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exclusive Debut","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3461588761","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning finds himself trapped inside the White House in the wake of a terrorist attack; using his inside knowledge, Banning works with national security to rescue the President from his kidnappers."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001173/","name":"Aaron Eckhart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332840/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4950667/","name":"Creighton Rothenberger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4951717/","name":"Katrin Benedikt"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Every once in a while, particularly during summer months when studios are rolling out their blockbuster hopefuls, you'll see a couple of movies released that seem to be mirror images of one-another. Not exactly the same, but similar enough that it seems like they must have some common ancestor.\n\nThe reason why this happens is pretty straight forward and has to do with the unusual way the movie industry works. Often, the scripts for movies aren't developed in-house by the studios, but rather purchased from freelance writers who come up with an idea and then "pitch" it to multiple studios looking for a buyer.\n\nThe process works for both the writers and the studios. There is a catch, however, which is that the person pitching relies upon a studio honoring an informal agreement not to use an idea without compensating the creator. The problem is that less scrupulous studio executives will have no problem passing on an idea and then blatantly copying it for their own movie. And even though everyone involved knows what's happening, it's pretty rare for anyone to actually sue over it, so it tends to keep happening.\n\nA famous example of this (famous in the relative sense) happened with the movies 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. The original author who pitched 'Deep Impact' watched a studio exec take copious notes during the pitch, pass on it, and then rush to create a script and get his ripped off version made in time to compete with 'Deep Impact', which was purchased by another studio.\n\nThis usually happens when someone creates a script that captures the zeitgeist; that taps into an idea that just clicks with what people are talking and thinking about and it becomes the "must have" idea of the year.\n\nUnless you're an industry insider, it can be difficult to know which movie was the original concept and which was the ripoff, but generally the original idea will be more polished and well thought out. 'Armageddon', for example, famously had such huge plot holes that the cast was complaining about them during filming.\n\n'Olympus Has Fallen' (OHF) came out around the same time as 'White House Down' (WHD). Both movies feature an attack on the white house with an invading force, aided by a turncoat secret service agent, conquering the presidential security in an attempt to take him hostage. Both movies also have a protagonist who isn't secret service, but has some connection to the agency and ultimately proves that he deserves to be guarding the president. Both movies involve protecting a child caught in the crossfire. Both have failed attempts by special forces to re-take the building. Both involve explosions that destroy the building. Both movies involve forcing a change to foreign policy. And so on, you get the idea.\n\nI don't know which was the original, but I have a guess. The movies were made during the presidency of Barack Obama. After he was elected, there was a lot of speculation about whether he would be the subject of an assassination attempt. To African Americans Obama represented an almost unbelievable event: one of their own elected to the most powerful office in the nation. And there was a great deal of angst about losing him violently, the way a number of prominent black leaders had been lost in the past. I think that was the kernel that sparked the original screenplay; this clash of the old power base and the new one in the symbolic seat of national power.\n\nTo my mind, WHD was the liberal take on the idea while OHF was the conservative counter. WHD featured a charismatic black president clearly modeled after Obama, right down to his attempts to quit smoking. The villains are white supremacist types backed by the old-guard military industrial complex who are fearful of the changes the president was making to foreign policy. And the protagonist is a millennial trying to prove he was worthy of the responsibility of protecting the president, perhaps an analogy for the young political activists that brought new methods of campaigning to Obama's election.\n\nOHF, by contrast, features a white male president with villains who were almost exclusively Asian, and rather than representing the supporters of the status quo they are actively looking to tear down American force abroad, suggesting that the bad guys can't stand how effective the traditional American foreign policy is. In other words, the message is "we are winning and they are getting desperate". Even the protagonist is more representative of the target audience: a middle-aged man with a penchant for defiantly vowing to destroy the villains and defend our way of life.\n\nNeither movie is particularly deep; it's mostly about the action sequences. In other words, these are popcorn movies. But I do think it's interesting how two such similar base ideas can manifest such different messages. While WHD is about the (then) rising tide of the progressive political movement and the supposed fear within groups that traditionally held power in the US, OHF is all about the traditional conservative message of Jingoism and the need to protect ourselves from the parts of the world that don't share our values.\n\nWhatever the case may be, OHF was successful enough to green light a second film 'London Has Fallen', which is a continuation of the themes, only with (primarily) middle-eastern villains instead of Asian ones, and an upcoming 'Angel Has Fallen'. Personally, I thought OHF was decent but unspectacular. I enjoyed it enough when I saw it on HBO or Netflix or wherever, but I probably wouldn't pay to see it in the theater.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"politics,political thriller,u.s. president,political assassination,white house","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exclusive Debut","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3461588761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning finds himself trapped inside the White House in the wake of a terrorist attack; using his inside knowledge, Banning works with national security to rescue the President from his kidnappers.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001173/","name":"Aaron Eckhart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332840/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4950667/","name":"Creighton Rothenberger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4951717/","name":"Katrin Benedikt"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The con-man Philippe Miller (played distinctly with a confident restraint by François Cluzet) enters the town planning to pocket cash bribes paid out by suppliers in return for contracts. However Philippe ends up becoming emotionally involved with the inhabitants of the town, romantically with its major Stephane (Emmanuelle Devos) and counterintuitively decides to force through the construction.

His revelatory "I've wasted too much time" highlights that personal gain is no longer essential, as he finds calm and happiness within his new role. The road he builds becomes a material accomplishment, a landmark to his success. (Shame that apparently in true-life the road had to be torn apart to avoid 'profiteering from illegal activities').\n\nNonetheless the dramatic impact has less to do with Philippe himself and more with the social turmoil initiated by the would-be builder's appearance. Despite various misgivings and warning signs none of them is followed through, as everyone becomes too involved in the change that is enacted. Happiness filters through the town summarised by a spectacular dance of heavy-duty construction vehicles around the bewildered Philippe.\n\nMuch akin to movies such as "Jerry Maguire" Giannoli however manages to keep the thrilling emotionality, which transgresses the con genre, and connects its with an astute European social-realism. "In the Beginning" does however tend to plod too carefully and meticulously through the whole sheenanigans, purposefully avoiding short-cuts, movie gimmickry and the sorts. That does cause the story to stall midway through and cause a certain overstatement of the messages on society. The solid runtime will dissuade many from viewing, even moreso that 30+ minutes seems essentially purposeless. Nonetheless the striking portrayals complemented by forceful direction wins big with a thoroughly satisfying movie underlining the need of self-fulfilment for personal dignity.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2370,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-11-11","keywords":"scam,highway,beetle,deception,road construction","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi582467865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmOTVjNmYtOGQ2OC00YTA2LTkxNmItYjdhOTk2ZDEyOWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmOTVjNmYtOGQ2OC00YTA2LTkxNmItYjdhOTk2ZDEyOWI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0167388/","name":"François Cluzet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0222922/","name":"Emmanuelle Devos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000367/","name":"Gérard Depardieu"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0316306/","name":"Xavier Giannoli"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126452/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0210188/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0316306/","name":"Xavier Giannoli"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1161469/","name":"Daniel Karlin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738925/","name":"Marcia Romano"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Looking at the implosion of a family from the perspective of a 14-year-old member of said family, the film is thematically similar to Revolutionary Road (2008) and Blue Valentine (2010), and aesthetically similar to the Texas scenes in The Tree of Life (2011) (the period detail drips off the screen, whilst the use of a child as the focaliser colours much of what's depicted). And although Wildlife is a piece of remarkably nostalgic filmmaking, at the same time, it tells somewhat of a progressive story, demonstrating the uncertainty with which second-wave feminism manifested itself at a grassroots level prior to really taking off in 1963. Although it's essentially a character study, the film also suggests the 1950s-style clean-cut, neatly trimmed, rigidly defined way of life, built around the perfect nuclear family wherein a wife must be subservient to her husband, is about to become a thing of the past.\n\nSet in Great Falls, Montana in 1960, the film tells the story of the peripatetic Brinson family; father Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal), mother Jeannette (Carey Mulligan), and 14-year-old son Joe (Ed Oxenbould). When Jerry loses his job and takes off in a misguided attempt to reaffirm his masculinity by fighting a forest fire, something is awoken in Jeanette, who, for the first time, allows herself to admit she has become deeply unhappy, and overnight, her behaviour changes dramatically, as she rebels against her domesticity. Determined to forge a new identity, she is adamant she won't become one of the "standing dead" (the term used for trees that survive a forest fire).\n\nImportantly, the film is set three years prior to Betty Friedan's ground-breaking The Feminine Mystique (1963), which redefined the parameters of all gender-based topics, depicting a society in which women were no longer content to do their husband's bidding and raise children. Initially, Jeanette is depicted as a quintessential 1950s wife and mother, almost to the point of cliché; she cooks, cleans, washes the clothes, does the dishes, sees that Joe attend to his homework, and when Jerry loses his job, it is Jeanette who goes out looking for work for both of them. She knows that her (unspoken and unacknowledged) role in this patriarchal society is to hold the family together, but it's a role that is nothing like she thought it would be when she was younger. Although she and Jerry seem to love one another, or they certainly used to, she clearly feels trapped by her domestic situation.\n\nThat her transformation happens so quickly is the key point; when she goes to bed, she's a wife and mother, trapped in her domestic environment, but when she wakes the next morning, she realises that she has an opportunity to escape, perhaps the best opportunity she will ever get. This has been building up for years, but she has gotten so used to feeling lost that when she gets a chance to change things, she doesn't even recognise it as such, at least not at first. Once she does, however, Jeanette makes a conscious decision to stop performing the role delegated by men. As much of the female population of the western hemisphere would be asking over the next ten or so years, Jeanette wants to know, "is this all there is?" She wants more than simply getting through the day. In this sense, she recalls Nora Helmer from Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House (1879), or any number of Tennessee Williams heroines - a woman who wakes up to find she has become deeply unhappy despite attaining everything she once wanted, and who sets out to do whatever it takes to alter her course.\n\nThat all is not well in the Brinson household is hinted at in the opening scene, where Jerry and Jeanette have a couple of inconsequential but noticeable disagreements over dinner (such as whether Joe should continue pursuing football). This scene establishes an assuredness and subtlety-of-hand that lasts for the entire film, with Dano's directorial work proving unexpectedly sophisticated. For example, something he does several times is have characters walk off-screen to speak, whilst keeping the camera trained on Joe as he tries to listen, with the dialogue barely perceptible from just off the edge of the frame. As well as being an excellent use of off-screen space, something you don't see too often, this technique ties us rigidly to Joe's POV early on, inculcating us into his worldview. Another very nice piece of direction is an early montage cutting between Jeanette riding her bike, Jerry driving the car, and Joe riding the bus, in which each character is facing a different direction, each in isolation from the other two. It's basic cinematic shorthand, showing instead of telling, but it's very well done. Equally impressive is the penultimate scene, where Dano uses the windows of the Brinson house to block the characters in such a way as to suggest both their inner emotions, and the prevailing theme at this point of the film. For the most part, however, Dano's direction is invisible, relying far more on static painterly compositions than camera movement.\n\nThe acting, as you would expect, is universally superb. On paper, Jeanette and Warren Miller (a superb Bill Camp), an older man who becomes romantically interested in her, are very much the villains of the piece, but Mulligan and Camp's performances are so full of warmth and genuine emotion that you simply can't look at them as antagonists, and the film itself never judges them. Mulligan plays Jeanette as utterly weary, much older than her years, at times fragile, at times rock solid, both vulnerable and manipulative. Full of anger, she simply can't hold in her emotions any more. Unfortunately, in letting them out, she betrays Joe by forgetting he is only 14-years-old. When she starts drunkenly dancing with him at Miller's house, the scene is deeply uncomfortable, but Mulligan's performance is such that we don't condemn her, at least, not completely. She never allows the audience to lose sight of the fact that although she is behaving rather poorly, she is a prisoner, and is reacting against her restraints as best she can.\n\nOf course, there are a few problems. Essentially a tale of marital angst, the narrative is not especially original - we've seen this story before, many times in fact, and for all the craft on display, Dano never really manages to say anything wholly new. Additionally, his measured direction is also too good in places - everything is so ordered, neat, and trim, that at times, the milieu doesn't seem lived-in, but more an abstract concept of what the period was like. Additionally, there are a few lines that sound great on paper, but which are just not the kind of things one says in real life. For example, Jeanette tells Joe, "I feel like I need to wake up, but I don't know what from, or what to". Later she says, "I wish I was dead. If you have a better plan for me, tell me. Maybe it'll be better than this". This kind of dialogue seems more interested in hitting thematic waypoints than developing character beats. Similarly, late in the film, Jerry says to Joe, "It's a wild life. Isn't it, son?" Proclaiming the film's title in this context doesn't even remotely work, and the line feels totally out of place, to the point of ripping you out of the narrative.\n\nOn the one hand, Wildlife is about how society was changing in 1960, and on the other, about how that change manifests itself within the Brinson family. Yes, it's another "death of the American dream" story in a long line of such films, but here, the focus is, for the most part, on character rather than theme, with Jeanette functioning in kind of a synecdochical manner; our specific entry point, she is the individual that facilitates an examination of the masses. And yes, Dano may take his eye off the ball a couple of times, with the odd bit of clunky dialogue, and a somewhat too picture-postcard perfection, but all in all, this is an excellent directorial debut.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26988,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-01-01","keywords":"1960s,unemployment,photography,infidelity,firefighter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1986312985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A boy witnesses his parents' marriage falling apart after his mother finds another man."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590837/","name":"Ed Oxenbould"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0585931/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0564372/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625497/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1443740/","name":"Zoe Kazan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285840/","name":"Richard Ford"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Looking at the implosion of a family from the perspective of a 14-year-old member of said family, the film is thematically similar to Revolutionary Road (2008) and Blue Valentine (2010), and aesthetically similar to the Texas scenes in The Tree of Life (2011) (the period detail drips off the screen, whilst the use of a child as the focaliser colours much of what's depicted). And although Wildlife is a piece of remarkably nostalgic filmmaking, at the same time, it tells somewhat of a progressive story, demonstrating the uncertainty with which second-wave feminism manifested itself at a grassroots level prior to really taking off in 1963. Although it's essentially a character study, the film also suggests the 1950s-style clean-cut, neatly trimmed, rigidly defined way of life, built around the perfect nuclear family wherein a wife must be subservient to her husband, is about to become a thing of the past.\n\nSet in Great Falls, Montana in 1960, the film tells the story of the peripatetic Brinson family; father Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal), mother Jeannette (Carey Mulligan), and 14-year-old son Joe (Ed Oxenbould). When Jerry loses his job and takes off in a misguided attempt to reaffirm his masculinity by fighting a forest fire, something is awoken in Jeanette, who, for the first time, allows herself to admit she has become deeply unhappy, and overnight, her behaviour changes dramatically, as she rebels against her domesticity. Determined to forge a new identity, she is adamant she won't become one of the "standing dead" (the term used for trees that survive a forest fire).\n\nImportantly, the film is set three years prior to Betty Friedan's ground-breaking The Feminine Mystique (1963), which redefined the parameters of all gender-based topics, depicting a society in which women were no longer content to do their husband's bidding and raise children. Initially, Jeanette is depicted as a quintessential 1950s wife and mother, almost to the point of cliché; she cooks, cleans, washes the clothes, does the dishes, sees that Joe attend to his homework, and when Jerry loses his job, it is Jeanette who goes out looking for work for both of them. She knows that her (unspoken and unacknowledged) role in this patriarchal society is to hold the family together, but it's a role that is nothing like she thought it would be when she was younger. Although she and Jerry seem to love one another, or they certainly used to, she clearly feels trapped by her domestic situation.\n\nThat her transformation happens so quickly is the key point; when she goes to bed, she's a wife and mother, trapped in her domestic environment, but when she wakes the next morning, she realises that she has an opportunity to escape, perhaps the best opportunity she will ever get. This has been building up for years, but she has gotten so used to feeling lost that when she gets a chance to change things, she doesn't even recognise it as such, at least not at first. Once she does, however, Jeanette makes a conscious decision to stop performing the role delegated by men. As much of the female population of the western hemisphere would be asking over the next ten or so years, Jeanette wants to know, "is this all there is?" She wants more than simply getting through the day. In this sense, she recalls Nora Helmer from Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House (1879), or any number of Tennessee Williams heroines - a woman who wakes up to find she has become deeply unhappy despite attaining everything she once wanted, and who sets out to do whatever it takes to alter her course.\n\nThat all is not well in the Brinson household is hinted at in the opening scene, where Jerry and Jeanette have a couple of inconsequential but noticeable disagreements over dinner (such as whether Joe should continue pursuing football). This scene establishes an assuredness and subtlety-of-hand that lasts for the entire film, with Dano's directorial work proving unexpectedly sophisticated. For example, something he does several times is have characters walk off-screen to speak, whilst keeping the camera trained on Joe as he tries to listen, with the dialogue barely perceptible from just off the edge of the frame. As well as being an excellent use of off-screen space, something you don't see too often, this technique ties us rigidly to Joe's POV early on, inculcating us into his worldview. Another very nice piece of direction is an early montage cutting between Jeanette riding her bike, Jerry driving the car, and Joe riding the bus, in which each character is facing a different direction, each in isolation from the other two. It's basic cinematic shorthand, showing instead of telling, but it's very well done. Equally impressive is the penultimate scene, where Dano uses the windows of the Brinson house to block the characters in such a way as to suggest both their inner emotions, and the prevailing theme at this point of the film. For the most part, however, Dano's direction is invisible, relying far more on static painterly compositions than camera movement.\n\nThe acting, as you would expect, is universally superb.

Mulligan plays Jeanette as utterly weary, much older than her years, at times fragile, at times rock solid, both vulnerable and manipulative. Full of anger, she simply can't hold in her emotions any more. Unfortunately, in letting them out, she betrays Joe by forgetting he is only 14-years-old. When she starts drunkenly dancing with him at Miller's house, the scene is deeply uncomfortable, but Mulligan's performance is such that we don't condemn her, at least, not completely. She never allows the audience to lose sight of the fact that although she is behaving rather poorly, she is a prisoner, and is reacting against her restraints as best she can.\n\nOf course, there are a few problems. Essentially a tale of marital angst, the narrative is not especially original - we've seen this story before, many times in fact, and for all the craft on display, Dano never really manages to say anything wholly new.

Yet whatever little duplication Wilson employs endears as he sweetly visits his heroes, falls in love, and comes to terms with his writer's voice and his mismatched engagement. But that engagement is the troublesome present; the past offers the chance to experience history on a human level that only someone who writes for now and reveres the past can do. \n\nThe magic and the realism, both requiring hard work from the protagonist, lead to surprising understanding of human nature, the delusion of nostalgia and Paris, and hope for a present that brings love and inspiration.\n\n"For all we know, Paris might be the hottest place in the universe."

How tempting!

Enticed by the money, Antoine, with the help of his friend Étienne, begins his search. He follows trails through Paris's night scene, gets beaten up and bitten, and meets Jordan's sister, Violaine.

The film reveals truth through taking the viewer on a journey to the past through the memories of people who witnessed the worst days of the conflict.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":56574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Documentary","Animation","Biography"],"datePublished":"2008-06-12","keywords":"lebanon,israel defense forces,animated documentary,mass murder,israel lebanon war","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Waltz with Bashir: Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3976855577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMDc3MTMyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg4NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMDc3MTMyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg4NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for Waltz with Bashir, directed by  Ari Folman.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0284369/","name":"Ari Folman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2924645/","name":"Ron Ben-Yishai","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2923235/","name":"Ronny Dayag"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0284369/","name":"Ari Folman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232356/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055455/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0284369/","name":"Ari Folman"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Otherwise this experiment in sociability and soulsearching has its charms.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":954,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-15","keywords":"summer,madrid spain,female protagonist,four word title,month in title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3108027417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYxY2JjZGYtZDNmZS00ZDU0LThmMzQtMWExZTY5NjM0OWE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYxY2JjZGYtZDNmZS00ZDU0LThmMzQtMWExZTY5NjM0OWE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3188127/","name":"Itsaso Arana","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5229490/","name":"Vito Sanz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831099/","name":"Isabelle Stoffel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0343903/","name":"Jonás Trueba"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0531697/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0157422/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071642/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3188127/","name":"Itsaso Arana","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0343903/","name":"Jonás Trueba"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In some key scenes she pivots to pride, and even arrogance, all of which convey the turmoil in the character.\n\nThe story is familiar enough and done in a style that is not hackneyed, using other elements, in locations and minor characters, to present the loneliness and failure of Harfouch's character.\n\nAn engaging film that is worth seeing again.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1825,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2019-11-07","keywords":"60th birthday,mother son conflict,piano teacher,suicidal thoughts,mother son relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi977779737","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY0MTNlYzktNWQxZi00MzRjLThmZTEtZjZlZjZjOWU4NjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY0MTNlYzktNWQxZi00MzRjLThmZTEtZjZlZjZjOWU4NjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3605549/","name":"Mala Emde"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771713/","name":"Tom Schilling"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0090674/","name":"Rainer Bock"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1673756/","name":"Jan-Ole Gerster"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323020/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051615/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002254/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092424/","name":"Blaz Kutin"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The writing has the qualities of an excellent short story; it builds through character and opens up the themes to the piece by episodes which are proportionate and cohere.\n\nCarrying the film, Harfouch, delivers a nuanced and strong performance in which she seems to have multiple ways to convey pain and regret, disappointment and disillusion. In some key scenes she pivots to pride, and even arrogance, all of which convey the turmoil in the character.\n\nThe story is familiar enough and done in a style that is not hackneyed, using other elements, in locations and minor characters, to present the loneliness and failure of Harfouch's character.\n\nAn engaging film that is worth seeing again.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1825,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2019-11-07","keywords":"60th birthday,mother son conflict,piano teacher,suicidal thoughts,mother son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi977779737","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY0MTNlYzktNWQxZi00MzRjLThmZTEtZjZlZjZjOWU4NjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY0MTNlYzktNWQxZi00MzRjLThmZTEtZjZlZjZjOWU4NjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3605549/","name":"Mala Emde","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771713/","name":"Tom Schilling","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0090674/","name":"Rainer Bock"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1673756/","name":"Jan-Ole Gerster"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323020/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051615/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002254/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092424/","name":"Blaz Kutin"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

One could take almost any frame in this film and hang it on a wall as a work of art. I could have watched this film in mute and enjoyed just the visual majesty of every scene.\n\nAfter doing work in films like the Spy Kids franchise, Antonio Banderas is developing a reputation, in my mind, as a recognizable actor who brings attention to otherwise obscure movies, not to drive up the budget, but to elevate attention to the art. I would have never watched Automata, had I not been wondering what Antonio Banderas was doing in that movie; only to be wonderfully surprised again. In this movie, I would say that his acting was adequate, but once again, after the Automata experience, I decided to give the movie a chance. I am so glad I did.\n\nMy favorite scenes were those involving Rupert Everett (Monsinor) and Golshifteh Farahani (Conchita). The cinematography was almost like watching an oil painting, with barely any movement, yet the tension and intensity of every scene was incredible. Was it sexual? Was it a power struggle? Was is a tug-of-war of morality? I could have watched them all day.\n\nThe little girl in the film, Allegra Allen (Maria), as most child actors tend to be, is just too precocious in this movie and the character almost did not work for me.

One could take almost any frame in this film and hang it on a wall as a work of art. I could have watched this film in mute and enjoyed just the visual majesty of every scene.\n\nAfter doing work in films like the Spy Kids franchise, Antonio Banderas is developing a reputation, in my mind, as a recognizable actor who brings attention to otherwise obscure movies, not to drive up the budget, but to elevate attention to the art. I would have never watched Automata, had I not been wondering what Antonio Banderas was doing in that movie; only to be wonderfully surprised again. In this movie, I would say that his acting was adequate, but once again, after the Automata experience, I decided to give the movie a chance. I am so glad I did.\n\nMy favorite scenes were those involving Rupert Everett (Monsinor) and Golshifteh Farahani (Conchita). The cinematography was almost like watching an oil painting, with barely any movement, yet the tension and intensity of every scene was incredible. Was it sexual? Was it a power struggle? Was is a tug-of-war of morality? I could have watched them all day.\n\nThe little girl in the film, Allegra Allen (Maria), as most child actors tend to be, is just too precocious in this movie and the character almost did not work for me. In my opinion, the point of view of the story shifted too much from the child in the beginning, the father in the middle, and the mother at the end. I believe the story would have been better served if the arc of Conchita's story would have remained the focus throughout.\n\nThere was an "affair of the heart" storyline which was totally unnecessary, in my opinion, and only included to generate more scenes and conflict for secondary actors. I believe the movie would have been just fine without diving into that part of the story and leaving it as wistful glances between two characters.\n\nThe story, whether parts are true or fictionalized, is simple enough and I would suggest, secondary to this film.\n\nYou should watch this movie if only for watching how beautiful the craft of movie making can be.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2669,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2016-04-01","keywords":"cave,discovery,father daughter relationship,19th century,spain","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Finding Altamira","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi760264473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyOGYzM2ItMzEwNC00Nzg1LThiYTItZjI2ZjhlYWYxZTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyOGYzM2ItMzEwNC00Nzg1LThiYTItZjI2ZjhlYWYxZTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Finding Altamira","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0796316/","name":"Clément Sibony","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000391/","name":"Rupert Everett"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0399853/","name":"Hugh Hudson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0585110/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0523978/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0663878/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381757/","name":"Olivia Hetreed","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006856/","name":"José Luis López-Linares"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

With a stunning central performance by Gary Oldman, confident and passionate directing from Joe Wright, and a brilliant screenplay from start to finish, Darkest Hour is a simply exceptional film.\n\nWhen telling a story as well-known as that of Winston Churchill and the Second World War, being both exciting and historically accurate isn't always easy, but that's where the unique take on the historical drama of Darkest Hour comes in.\n\nYes, it does tell of the extreme intensity of the early days of the war, the political manoeuvring in Westminster as Churchill was appointed Prime Minister, and the very real and impending threat that the fall of Britain could very well mean the end of freedom-loving Western civilisation, which are all absolutely fascinating to watch unfold, but they're all parts of history that you arguably already know very well.\n\nThat's why the film's decision to bring a brilliant sense of humour and a strong passion to proceedings is so effective. The importance of the events being portrayed on screen is never downplayed, and there are indeed some very intense and emotionally powerful moments, but there's so much more to Darkest Hour than just history, something that made it such a refreshing watch compared to how most Oscar-bait biographies turn out.\n\nAbove all, what impressed me most about the film was the fact that it's just so funny. It's by no means a comedy, but this isn't a pompous and dry historical drama, but one that takes glee in pointing out the eccentricities in its main character, eccentricities which are undoubtedly a part of why Churchill is so lauded and respected to this day.\n\nWhile the film praises Churchill's bulldog spirit in fighting the fight against the Nazis, it's always keen to show him in a slightly brighter light, almost as if he was a man who stumbled into the most important job in history by coincidence. In that, there are so many genuinely hilarious scenes as Churchill's quirky personality clashes with the more uptight politicians of Westminster, a part of the film that I felt not only made everything more entertaining, but helped to give the movie an incredibly refreshing energy, allowing me to see Churchill in a very relatable, personal light rather than just as a historical figure from a textbook.\n\nAs well as being downright hilarious at points, there's a real passion behind the film's depiction of the darkest hours of the war. With Churchill being forced over to opening peace talks with Hitler, the film does an incredible job at inspiring you to a point of fever pitch, fully backing Churchill's bulldog spirit to fight and defend freedom to the very last moment, meaning that the internal conflict he suffers throughout the film is such a riveting focal point.\n\nThis is an undoubtedly patriotic film, and heaps a lot of praise onto Churchill's gusto, but that doesn't mean it's overly jingoistic. There may be a case that Brits watching the film will feel more emotion from its incredible passion, but I still feel that most of that comes from how well the character of Churchill is developed throughout, from a bumbling, mumbling, lovable old man to a truly honest and principled leader.\n\nFinally, we have to talk about Gary Oldman's performance, which is amazing. For one, thanks of course in part to the make-up and costume teams, it's pretty impossible to tell that you're watching Gary Oldman in this movie. But not only does he look nothing like Oldman, and so much more like Churchill, but everything about Oldman's performance, from the smallest details about Churchill to his fantastic passion and energy on screen, pulls you further and further into the moment, and creates an exceptionally convincing portrayal of the great man and the situation surrounding him, which I was blown away by.\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved Darkest Hour. It's an undoubtedly riveting historical drama about a crucial turning point in global history, but more than that, it's full of incredible energy from start to finish, with amazing and still appropriate humour throughout combined with stunning patriotic passion, making for a genuinely exciting and properly entertaining film that does so much more than your typical Oscar-bait fare.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":184944,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-12-22","keywords":"world war two,speech,prime minister,politics,winston churchill character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3915626777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk0OTM5MDIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2Nzk2MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk0OTM5MDIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2Nzk2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"This true story begins at the precipice of World War II as, within days of becoming Prime Minister of Great Britain, Winston Churchill (Academy Award nominee Gary Oldman) must face one of his most turbulent and defining trials: exploring a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany, or standing firm to fight for the ideals, liberty and freedom of a nation.

 --- Description: Darkest Hour: Directed by Joe Wright. With Gary Oldman, Kristin Scott Thomas, Ben Mendelsohn, Lily James. In May 1940, the fate of World War II hangs on Winston Churchill, who must decide whether to negotiate with Adolf Hitler, or fight on knowing that it could mean the end of the British Empire." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt4555426/","name":"Darkest Hour","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTU4MjMwOTgyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQzNjY2NDM@._V1_.jpg","description":"In May 1940, the fate of World War II hangs on Winston Churchill, who must decide whether to negotiate with Adolf Hitler, or fight on knowing that it could mean the end of the British Empire.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt4555426/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"themadmovieman","dateCreated":"2017-12-03","inLanguage":"English","name":"Historically fascinating, but most importantly filled with exhilarating energy, humour and passion throughout","reviewBody":"Not only is this a riveting account of one of the most important moments of the Second World War, but it's also an exhilarating drama that goes beyond being a simple biography by bringing humour, energy and passion to every moment. With a stunning central performance by Gary Oldman, confident and passionate directing from Joe Wright, and a brilliant screenplay from start to finish, Darkest Hour is a simply exceptional film.\n\nWhen telling a story as well-known as that of Winston Churchill and the Second World War, being both exciting and historically accurate isn't always easy, but that's where the unique take on the historical drama of Darkest Hour comes in.\n\nYes, it does tell of the extreme intensity of the early days of the war, the political manoeuvring in Westminster as Churchill was appointed Prime Minister, and the very real and impending threat that the fall of Britain could very well mean the end of freedom-loving Western civilisation, which are all absolutely fascinating to watch unfold, but they're all parts of history that you arguably already know very well.\n\nThat's why the film's decision to bring a brilliant sense of humour and a strong passion to proceedings is so effective. The importance of the events being portrayed on screen is never downplayed, and there are indeed some very intense and emotionally powerful moments, but there's so much more to Darkest Hour than just history, something that made it such a refreshing watch compared to how most Oscar-bait biographies turn out.\n\nAbove all, what impressed me most about the film was the fact that it's just so funny. It's by no means a comedy, but this isn't a pompous and dry historical drama, but one that takes glee in pointing out the eccentricities in its main character, eccentricities which are undoubtedly a part of why Churchill is so lauded and respected to this day.\n\nWhile the film praises Churchill's bulldog spirit in fighting the fight against the Nazis, it's always keen to show him in a slightly brighter light, almost as if he was a man who stumbled into the most important job in history by coincidence. In that, there are so many genuinely hilarious scenes as Churchill's quirky personality clashes with the more uptight politicians of Westminster, a part of the film that I felt not only made everything more entertaining, but helped to give the movie an incredibly refreshing energy, allowing me to see Churchill in a very relatable, personal light rather than just as a historical figure from a textbook.\n\nAs well as being downright hilarious at points, there's a real passion behind the film's depiction of the darkest hours of the war. With Churchill being forced over to opening peace talks with Hitler, the film does an incredible job at inspiring you to a point of fever pitch, fully backing Churchill's bulldog spirit to fight and defend freedom to the very last moment, meaning that the internal conflict he suffers throughout the film is such a riveting focal point.\n\nThis is an undoubtedly patriotic film, and heaps a lot of praise onto Churchill's gusto, but that doesn't mean it's overly jingoistic. There may be a case that Brits watching the film will feel more emotion from its incredible passion, but I still feel that most of that comes from how well the character of Churchill is developed throughout, from a bumbling, mumbling, lovable old man to a truly honest and principled leader.\n\nFinally, we have to talk about Gary Oldman's performance, which is amazing. For one, thanks of course in part to the make-up and costume teams, it's pretty impossible to tell that you're watching Gary Oldman in this movie. But not only does he look nothing like Oldman, and so much more like Churchill, but everything about Oldman's performance, from the smallest details about Churchill to his fantastic passion and energy on screen, pulls you further and further into the moment, and creates an exceptionally convincing portrayal of the great man and the situation surrounding him, which I was blown away by.\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved Darkest Hour. It's an undoubtedly riveting historical drama about a crucial turning point in global history, but more than that, it's full of incredible energy from start to finish, with amazing and still appropriate humour throughout combined with stunning patriotic passion, making for a genuinely exciting and properly entertaining film that does so much more than your typical Oscar-bait fare.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":184944,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-12-22","keywords":"world war two,speech,prime minister,politics,winston churchill character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3915626777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk0OTM5MDIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2Nzk2MzI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk0OTM5MDIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2Nzk2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"This true story begins at the precipice of World War II as, within days of becoming Prime Minister of Great Britain, Winston Churchill (Academy Award nominee Gary Oldman) must face one of his most turbulent and defining trials: exploring a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany, or standing firm to fight for the ideals, liberty and freedom of a nation. As the unstoppable Nazi forces roll across Western Europe and the threat of invasion is imminent, and with an unprepared public, a skeptical King, and his own party plotting against him, Churchill must withstand his darkest hour, rally a nation, and attempt to change the course of world history.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000198/","name":"Gary Oldman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4141252/","name":"Lily James","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000218/","name":"Kristin Scott Thomas"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942504/","name":"Joe Wright"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346224/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565026/","name":"Anthony McCarten"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sure, they're not Pixar. Sure, they're too hung up on star power and pop culture references. But I've still enjoyed the majority their films more than I have a lot of what's out there. And I love the first two "Shrek" movies. Their funny, entertaining, terrifically animated, and, too me, some of the best animated love stories that have been made. Most fairy tale romances perpetuate the idea that love is for beautiful people (even the masterpiece "Beauty and the Beast" has it's cake and eats it too on this point), and Princes and Princesses are better than common people. "Shrek"'s idea of finding happiness in who you are was much more palatable to me. i found the first film a delight, and the second even better.\n\nBut the third was only okay. The humor wasn't nearly as clever or funny, and the heart just wasn't there like it used to be. "Shrek Forever After" isn't as good as those first two. But it's a big step back in the right direction.\n\nThe story begins with Shrek getting used to being a father. He loves Fiona and the kids, but he misses his old life as a menacing ogre. He's seen more as a lovable tourist attraction now, and he doesn't like it. So, he makes a deal with the mysterious Rumpletiltskin (surprisingly NOT voiced by a name actor) to get one day back in his old life. In exchange, he gives up one day from his past. A day from his childhood that he doesn't even remember.\n\nUnfortuntaely, that day turns out to be the day he was born, and this leads to an "It's a Wonderful Life" scenario where Shrek doesn't know Fiona, Donkey, Puss-in-Boots, or any of his friends, and Rumplestiltskin rules the Kingdom with a tiny iron fist. The resulting story is a great deal of fun, with Fiona now a warrior leading an ogre rebellion, the Gingerbread Man fighting as a gladiator against Animal Crackers, and so forth. The humor isn't back to it's highest heights, but there are a good number of genuine laughs. And the heart is back bigtime.

Sure, they're not Pixar. Sure, they're too hung up on star power and pop culture references. But I've still enjoyed the majority their films more than I have a lot of what's out there. And I love the first two "Shrek" movies. Their funny, entertaining, terrifically animated, and, too me, some of the best animated love stories that have been made. Most fairy tale romances perpetuate the idea that love is for beautiful people (even the masterpiece "Beauty and the Beast" has it's cake and eats it too on this point), and Princes and Princesses are better than common people. "Shrek"'s idea of finding happiness in who you are was much more palatable to me. i found the first film a delight, and the second even better.\n\nBut the third was only okay. The humor wasn't nearly as clever or funny, and the heart just wasn't there like it used to be. "Shrek Forever After" isn't as good as those first two. But it's a big step back in the right direction.\n\nThe story begins with Shrek getting used to being a father. He loves Fiona and the kids, but he misses his old life as a menacing ogre. He's seen more as a lovable tourist attraction now, and he doesn't like it. So, he makes a deal with the mysterious Rumpletiltskin (surprisingly NOT voiced by a name actor) to get one day back in his old life. In exchange, he gives up one day from his past. A day from his childhood that he doesn't even remember.\n\nUnfortuntaely, that day turns out to be the day he was born, and this leads to an "It's a Wonderful Life" scenario where Shrek doesn't know Fiona, Donkey, Puss-in-Boots, or any of his friends, and Rumplestiltskin rules the Kingdom with a tiny iron fist. The resulting story is a great deal of fun, with Fiona now a warrior leading an ogre rebellion, the Gingerbread Man fighting as a gladiator against Animal Crackers, and so forth. The humor isn't back to it's highest heights, but there are a good number of genuine laughs. And the heart is back bigtime. I found "Shrek Forever After" surprisingly touching..\n\nOkay, it's not as good as "Toy Story 3" is likely to be, nor is it as good as "How to train your Dragon". but I had a blast with "Shrek Forver After" Evren Buyruk","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":193214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-06-02","keywords":"ogre,donkey,alternate timeline,friend,deal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shrek Forever After: Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2299660057","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NDAzMzI2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI1OTM0Mw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NDAzMzI2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI1OTM0Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A bored and domesticated Shrek pacts with deal-maker Rumpelstiltskin to get back to feeling like a real ogre again, but when he's duped and sent to a twisted version of Far Far Away -- where Rumpelstiltskin is king, ogres are hunted, and he and Fiona have never met -- he sets out to restore his world and reclaim his true love.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000552/","name":"Eddie Murphy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593610/","name":"Mike Mitchell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458441/","name":"Josh Klausner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501359/","name":"Darren Lemke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0825308/","name":"William Steig"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This movie is the most underrated movie of all time.\n\nJust make sure you acquire a GOOD translation, if one exists.  Carl "the Butcher" Macek's Streamline Pictures release got horrible ratings due to his unchecked editors, unfaithful translators and third-rate voice actors. Fan-made subtitled copies are far more enjoyable, but quality is still not guaranteed.

Let's define difficult, shall we? Is it difficult to see the first openly gay politician gunned down by his closeted colleague? Is it difficult to see a reformed convict put to death by our country for his crimes? Is it difficult to see a mother choose which one of her children dies during the Holocaust? I'd argue that these answers add up to a resounding yes. Yet, no one threw those phrases of "too difficult" around.\n\nI've watched hundreds of films throughout my short 29-year history and I've seen some difficult cinema. Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List" can make anyone quiver in shame as it shows the despicable reality of the Holocaust. Paul Greengrass' "United 93", which is almost an emotional biopic of America's darkest hour, makes me want to crawl up into a ball and cry. And finally, Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ", one of the highest grossing films of all-time, shows the labor of our sins fleshed out into the beaten skin of an honest man. And still, no one threw these hyperbolic terms out saying, "it's too hard watch." Is it because this is an American tragedy, done by Americans? Is it the guilt of someone's ancestors manifesting it in your tear ducts? I can't answer that. Only the person who says it can. The structure of this country is built on the backs and blood of slaves. But slavery didn't just exist in America, it was everywhere. It was horrifying what occurred for over 200 years and believe it or not, still exists in some parts of the world TODAY.\n\nNow when approaching the powerful film by McQueen and distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, there is a resounding honesty that McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley inhabit. There are no tricks or gimmicks, no cheap takes on a side story or character that is put there for time filling or a life-lesson for Solomon to learn. Everything is genuine. Is the film heartbreaking? Oh my God yes. Did I cry for several minutes after the screening? Embarrassingly so. I was enamored the entire time, head to toe, moment to moment.\n\nI have long admired the talent that's been evident in the works of Chiwetel Ejiofor. I've known he was capable of what he has accomplished as Solomon Northup and he hits it out of the park. He has the urgency, worry, and drive to get home to his family and executes every emotion flawlessly even when all hope seems to be lost. Where he shines incredibly are the small nuances that he takes as the story slows down, you notice aspects of Solomon that make him even more believable.\n\nAs Edwin Epps, Solomon's last owner, Michael Fassbender digs down deep into some evil territory. Acts as the "Amon Goeth" of our tale, he is exactly what you'd expect a person who believes this should be a way of life to behave. He's vile and strikes fear into not only the people he interacts with but with the viewers who watch. As Mrs. Epps, Sarah Paulson is just as wretched. Abusive, conniving, entitled, and I loved every second of her.\n\nMark my words; Lupita Nyong'o is the emotional epicenter of the entire film. The heartache, tears, and anger that will grow inside during the feature will have our beautiful "Patsey" at the core. She is the great find of our film year and will surely go on to more dynamic and passionate projects in the future. You're watching the birth of a star.\n\nHans Zimmer puts forth a very pronounced score, enriched with all the subtle ticks that strike the chords of tone. One thing that cannot be denied is the exquisite camera work of Sean Bobbit. Weaving through the parts of boat and then through the grassroots of a cotton field, he puts himself in the leagues of Roger Deakins and Seamus McGarvey as one of the most innovative and exciting DP's in the business. Especially following his work in "The Place Beyond the Pines" earlier this year. Simply marvelous.\n\nOscar chances, since I know many of you are wondering. Put the Oscar's in my hands, you have a dozen nominations reap for the taking. Best Picture, Director, Lead Actor, Supporting Actor, dual Supporting Actresses, Adapted Screenplay, Production Design, Cinematography, Costume Design, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score. There's also a strong and rich sound scope that is present. The sounds of nature as the slaves walk or as Solomon approaches his master's house is noticed. The big question is, can it win? I haven't seen everything yet so I cannot yet if it deserves it or not. I can say, if critics and audiences can get off this "difficult" watch nonsense and accept the cinematic endeavor as a look into our own history as told from a great auteur, there's no reason it can't top the night. I'm very aware that seeing this film along with Steve McQueen crowned by Oscar is nearly erasing 85 years of history in the Academy. Are they willing and ready to begin looking into new realms and allowing someone not necessarily in their inner circles to make a bold statement as McQueen and Ridley take in "12 Years a Slave?" I remain hopeful.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":664413,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2013-11-08","keywords":"slavery,separation from family,torture,kidnapping,racism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi302032921","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MjI1OTI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMwODQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MjI1OTI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMwODQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the antebellum United States, Solomon Northup, a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0252230/","name":"Chiwetel Ejiofor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0931324/","name":"Michael Kenneth Williams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2588606/","name":"Steve McQueen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0120121/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136967/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0725983/","name":"John Ridley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1185849/","name":"Solomon Northup"}],"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Weaving through the parts of boat and then through the grassroots of a cotton field, he puts himself in the leagues of Roger Deakins and Seamus McGarvey as one of the most innovative and exciting DP's in the business. Especially following his work in "The Place Beyond the Pines" earlier this year. Simply marvelous.\n\nOscar chances, since I know many of you are wondering. Put the Oscar's in my hands, you have a dozen nominations reap for the taking. Best Picture, Director, Lead Actor, Supporting Actor, dual Supporting Actresses, Adapted Screenplay, Production Design, Cinematography, Costume Design, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score. There's also a strong and rich sound scope that is present. The sounds of nature as the slaves walk or as Solomon approaches his master's house is noticed. The big question is, can it win? I haven't seen everything yet so I cannot yet if it deserves it or not. I can say, if critics and audiences can get off this "difficult" watch nonsense and accept the cinematic endeavor as a look into our own history as told from a great auteur, there's no reason it can't top the night. I'm very aware that seeing this film along with Steve McQueen crowned by Oscar is nearly erasing 85 years of history in the Academy. Are they willing and ready to begin looking into new realms and allowing someone not necessarily in their inner circles to make a bold statement as McQueen and Ridley take in "12 Years a Slave?" I remain hopeful.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":664413,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2013-11-08","keywords":"slavery,separation from family,torture,kidnapping,racism","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi302032921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MjI1OTI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMwODQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MjI1OTI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMwODQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the antebellum United States, Solomon Northup, a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0252230/","name":"Chiwetel Ejiofor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0931324/","name":"Michael Kenneth Williams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2588606/","name":"Steve McQueen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0120121/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136967/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0725983/","name":"John Ridley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1185849/","name":"Solomon Northup"],"duration":"PT2H14M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It explains the bound between the two protagonists. Once again Department Q delivers an emotional and strongly written police adventure.

The pace, direction and writing has been excellent. I have watched and re-watched every episode over the past 3 seasons and really can't understand why they would cancel this show for the ages. First I was not a person that watched West Wing. I was younger and dumber for the show to stick. this show grabbed me from the get go and I have never been more surprised with it's greatness.\n\nHBO - why oh why are buying into the big network belief that the public is not getting what you bring us. This show is why I subscribe to your network and seeing it leave is a shame. The past episode "Oh Shenandoah" was brilliant is so many ways. It left me thinking about my father and how we can challenge ourselves in moments of being tested. I came here to tell everyone I will watch the last episode with sadness and wish I could continue this great program going forward, but it's over. I will save these three seasons and remember every episode with fondness and hope to see these great actors, directors and writers in the future where they can continue to express themselves without worrying about ratings or money driven desires.\n\nThank you for 3 great seasons!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":108689,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-06-24","keywords":"newsroom,ethics,television producer,news reporting,tv news","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001099/","name":"Jeff Daniels","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0607865/","name":"Emily Mortimer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0302330/","name":"John Gallagher Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0284741/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3499276825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjVjNmNhNTEtYWQyZi00OTljLWI1YjUtMGMyNGFlOWM4NDg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjVjNmNhNTEtYWQyZi00OTljLWI1YjUtMGMyNGFlOWM4NDg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This season the writers appear to be focusing on the development of the characters. They are finally giving Alex a soul by showing the inner turmoils he possesses which gives reason for his rude demeanor.\n\nSimilar to a lot of other shows, in my opinion, the supporting cast steal the show! Christina (Sandra Oh) is my favorite because her character is so complex and hilarious! It may also be because she is the comic relief, along with George (T.R Knight).\n\nThis show is great...and it just keeps getting better! Tune in! I highly recommend it!

The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. \n\nSandra Oh stands out for her comic timing, but the entire cast is superb. It's not as grave as ER, but is just as compelling. Also, it's a little more accessible than ER and some of the more serious medical dramas. The show is definitely worth catching--if you can't watch it when it airs, TiVo it or rent the first season DVD. It's well worth the time spent! It's great for marathon viewings!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":270305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The pace, direction and writing has been excellent. I have watched and re-watched every episode over the past 3 seasons and really can't understand why they would cancel this show for the ages. First I was not a person that watched West Wing. I was younger and dumber for the show to stick. this show grabbed me from the get go and I have never been more surprised with it's greatness.\n\nHBO - why oh why are buying into the big network belief that the public is not getting what you bring us. This show is why I subscribe to your network and seeing it leave is a shame. The past episode "Oh Shenandoah" was brilliant is so many ways. It left me thinking about my father and how we can challenge ourselves in moments of being tested.

Taking place shortly after World War I, Van Damme plays Chris Dubois, a humble indentured servant figure with Rocky-like ambitions to become a big fighting champion. Dubois has set his sights on some very elite and secret tournament in some mystical forbidden city, to which only the best fighter in every country of the world gets an invitation.\n\nTo get into the tournament, Dubois enlists the help of a mischievous figure, Lord Dobbs. In one of the many parts of the plot I was unable to follow, Lord Dobbs owes him some unknown favor so he buys his freedom and makes arrangements to get the kid to Beijing, with the aide of an attractive blonde newspaper editor, Carrie Newton (Gunn).\n\nDobbs is played by seven-time James Bond alumni Roger Moore, who I'm so used to seeing as Bond that I half-expected him to, at a crucial point in the movie, bag the attractive news lady, beat someone up, or use some cool gadget. Sadly, Moore only accomplishes one of these three things (uses a cool gadget) and fails miserably at it. However, Moore does carry one James Bond-like trait to this part which is being a smooth talker which gets Dubois in trouble in the first place. Apparently, Dubois was never really entered into the tournament, so he must win over the guy who's slated to fight for the U.S. and get his invitation, which raises the question, isn't Dubois French?\n\nAnyway, there's no reason to fret over little things like that, because considering the plot is secondary to the action, it's pretty well-thought out, and besides the action doesn't disappoint.\n\nThe tournament where most of the actions scenes come from is probably my favorite thing about the movie because the single elimination bracketed format has the same thrill as watching something like NCAA's March Madness. The only difference is that except for rooting for your favorite colleges, you root for Industrial Era superpowers. The other plus of this was that the clashing of such a diverse array of fighting styles (sumo wrestling, Scottish fist fighting, Brazillian street fighting, and the like) led to some great action scenes.\n\nMy main complaint about the action is that Van Damme's fight scenes attempt to create suspense by him being knocked down and then supposedly against our expectations, getting back up and winning. This just becomes predictable, and besides, because the Master of Ceremonies usually hits the gong after a guy gets knocked down, Dubois would have realistically been out in the second round after getting the crap beat out of him by the Spaniard. Even if he did get back up, he wouldn't have been able to overpower the other guy after having taken so many hits. If he is such a skillful fighter, why doesn't he just win the fight efficiently without all the drama? He reminds me of the present-day LA Lakers who slack off the entire regular season, knowing that they only really have to work during the playoffs.\n\nThis gag would have been an effective if it was restricted to only happening in the film's climatic finale. Instead, to top the earlier fights, the tournament's final match really got to be a disappointment. The master of ceremonies was incredibly generous with the gong, deciding to let the fight continue even after Dubois got knocked down twice and kicked out of the ring, where he is beaten up some more and magically throws in a couple kicks at the right moment and walks away with the medallion.\n\nAnyway, the film is a decently played out story that has its moments.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25361,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1996-04-26","keywords":"martial arts tournament,orphan,golden dragon,lost city,slow motion scene","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000549/","name":"Roger Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001664/","name":"James Remar"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086487/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003583/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119730/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245235/","name":"Frank Dux"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12026427/","name":"Steven Klein"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The master of ceremonies was incredibly generous with the gong, deciding to let the fight continue even after Dubois got knocked down twice and kicked out of the ring, where he is beaten up some more and magically throws in a couple kicks at the right moment and walks away with the medallion.\n\nAnyway, the film is a decently played out story that has its moments.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25361,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1996-04-26","keywords":"martial arts tournament,orphan,golden dragon,lost city,slow motion scene","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000549/","name":"Roger Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001664/","name":"James Remar"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086487/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003583/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119730/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245235/","name":"Frank Dux","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000241/","name":"Jean-Claude Van Damme","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12026427/","name":"Steven Klein"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The film features a relatively simple but clever premise: Superhottie Kylie Travis stars as Karen Warren, a police negotiator who's on vacation in Texas. She gets into a car accident and has to hitchhike with a somewhat odd, but seemingly friendly couple, Frank and Rayanne (James Belushi and Shannon Whirry). \n\nBut everything goes horribly wrong when Frank discovers Rayanne has been cheating on him and he murders her right in front of Karen's eyes, who proceeds to run to the nearest building, a government-owned complex run by a single occupant, a scientist named Brian (Frank Whaley). There, he accidentally activates the time travel device he was working on, sending Karen back twenty minutes, just as she's been picked up by Frank. She then becomes determined to stop the horrible crime for occurring, but unfortunately, the body count grows even larger and she must go back again to prevent an even larger massacre.\n\nRetroactive's appeal holds mainly to sci-fi action fans. The plot has a lot of twists and turns, which keeps the film unpredictable and suspenseful. But the real treat is for action fans, who should strap in for an adrenaline-pumping thrill ride. From the moment Travis is sent back in time, the film deliver non-stop excitement. There are tense shootouts and fast-paced car chases, the latter of which boasts some of the most exhilarating stunts since The Road Warrior. From a visceral point-of-view, Retroactive surpasses most of Hollywood's recent summer blockbusters. \n\nThe film still has its flaws, none of them surprisingly having to do with a sense of repetition, considering each action setpiece has the same basic setting and situation (car chase on a lonely desert highway, shootout at a gas station). Credit director Louis Morneau for keeping each sequence fresh and taut with suspense. The set-up may be the same, but the results and resolutions considerably differ. Rather, what I do have a problem with is some technical error during the shootouts. Belushi is shown firing a six-bullet revolver at one point, but clearly fires more than ten rounds. Another similar blatant miscalculation occurs again near the end. Plot holes and leaps of logic are expected in this kind of film, but the number of shots fired from a gun shouldn't be that hard to keep track of.\n\nAs the film's tough heroine, the absolutely gorgeous Kylie Travis is refreshingly intelligent and strong-willed. She occasionally has trouble holding back that British accent of hers, but still comes across quite well (looks great in that black tank-top, too). James Belushi is a lot of fun as the psychotic villain, clearly relishing the over-the-top role, even though his character does lose menace through some ridiculous one-liners. Frank Whaley is quite good as the young scientist, hampered only by a single scene that requires him to forget the logic of his own device which Travis corrects him on.\n\nWith blistering, fast-paced action and a fun story, Retroactive proves to be a highly enjoyable way to spend ninety minutes. Most of the running time features a tight tank-top and pants wearing Kylie Travis kicking ass, so that alone is enough to recommend the film."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6028,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1997-01-01","keywords":"time travel,alternate timeline,crime of passion,race against time,rampage","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000902/","name":"Jim Belushi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0871406/","name":"Kylie Travis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0924204/","name":"Shannon Whirry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007128/","name":"Louis Morneau"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001995/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010022/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358228/","name":"Michael Hamilton-Wright"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0833866/","name":"Robert Strauss"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046093/","name":"Phillip Badger"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

We have seen an influx of Alien takeovers recently and it is getting a bit stale I must admit. Don't get me wrong, I love films about ET's taking over, but Hollywood has beaten that horse to death. "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" is a welcome change to this trend pitting us measly humans against our closest ancestors, Great Apes. Directed by Rupert Wyatt ("The Escapist") and supported by the unbelievable WETA Digital ("King Kong", "Lord of the Rings", "Avatar") for special effects. "Apes" is a wonder of motion capture, an intelligent heart felt script with great direction. Unfortunately, the human actors left a lot to be desired. But this film isn't about the humans, it's all about the Simians.\n\nAs plots go, this is pretty basic. James Franco plays Will Rodman, a brilliant scientist with a breakthrough drug that just may cure Alzheimer's. Rodman and his team are using chimpanzee's to test this new drug and in the process find out that it increases intelligence as well as repair cells in the brain. One of the test subjects gets loose in an intense sequence and ultimately put down. It turns out that she had just given birth to a beautiful baby chimp who inherited this new "altered" gene. Rodman decides the only moral thing to do is to take the baby home while a co-worker tries to find a sanctuary but once Rodman finds out that this little ball of fur has the intelligence of a human child twice it's age he decides to keep and raise the chimp as a child. It's only a matter of time that our chimp Caesar figures out he is not like the other children in the neighborhood.

We have seen an influx of Alien takeovers recently and it is getting a bit stale I must admit. Don't get me wrong, I love films about ET's taking over, but Hollywood has beaten that horse to death. "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" is a welcome change to this trend pitting us measly humans against our closest ancestors, Great Apes. Directed by Rupert Wyatt ("The Escapist") and supported by the unbelievable WETA Digital ("King Kong", "Lord of the Rings", "Avatar") for special effects. "Apes" is a wonder of motion capture, an intelligent heart felt script with great direction. Unfortunately, the human actors left a lot to be desired. But this film isn't about the humans, it's all about the Simians.\n\nAs plots go, this is pretty basic. James Franco plays Will Rodman, a brilliant scientist with a breakthrough drug that just may cure Alzheimer's. Rodman and his team are using chimpanzee's to test this new drug and in the process find out that it increases intelligence as well as repair cells in the brain. One of the test subjects gets loose in an intense sequence and ultimately put down. It turns out that she had just given birth to a beautiful baby chimp who inherited this new "altered" gene. Rodman decides the only moral thing to do is to take the baby home while a co-worker tries to find a sanctuary but once Rodman finds out that this little ball of fur has the intelligence of a human child twice it's age he decides to keep and raise the chimp as a child. It's only a matter of time that our chimp Caesar figures out he is not like the other children in the neighborhood. Rodman is forced to give up Caesar to an "Ape Sanctuary" and there begins some of the most exhilarating revolutionary action I've ever seen.\n\nTechnically, this film is massive. The work WETA Digital did with motion capture (mo-cap) is truly a wonder to behold. Visual Effects Supervisor with WETA Digital Joe Letteri stated that they built on the technology used in "Avatar" to produce the most realistic and accurate portrayal of the actors suited to play the Simians. Andy Serkis (Gollum from "Lord of the Rings" and Kong from "King Kong") plays chimp Caesar. Serkis manages to fool all of us into believing he is a real animal with super intelligence. His facial emotions and mannerisms should most certainly nominate him for an Oscar. There is a real connection that the audience feels with Caesar and it is all thanks to Serkis' work. Without such an experienced mo-cap actor, this film would not have been such a success.\n\nNot only is the technology used to create the revolution amazing, the action is top notch as well. Many times I found myself with my jaw on the floor from the intense sequences put to screen. Everything from a simple terrifying look from an angry ape to the full out battle on the Golden Gate Bridge was pulled off without a hitch.

We have seen an influx of Alien takeovers recently and it is getting a bit stale I must admit. Don't get me wrong, I love films about ET's taking over, but Hollywood has beaten that horse to death. "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" is a welcome change to this trend pitting us measly humans against our closest ancestors, Great Apes. Directed by Rupert Wyatt ("The Escapist") and supported by the unbelievable WETA Digital ("King Kong", "Lord of the Rings", "Avatar") for special effects. "Apes" is a wonder of motion capture, an intelligent heart felt script with great direction. Unfortunately, the human actors left a lot to be desired. But this film isn't about the humans, it's all about the Simians.\n\nAs plots go, this is pretty basic. James Franco plays Will Rodman, a brilliant scientist with a breakthrough drug that just may cure Alzheimer's. Rodman and his team are using chimpanzee's to test this new drug and in the process find out that it increases intelligence as well as repair cells in the brain. One of the test subjects gets loose in an intense sequence and ultimately put down. It turns out that she had just given birth to a beautiful baby chimp who inherited this new "altered" gene. Rodman decides the only moral thing to do is to take the baby home while a co-worker tries to find a sanctuary but once Rodman finds out that this little ball of fur has the intelligence of a human child twice it's age he decides to keep and raise the chimp as a child. It's only a matter of time that our chimp Caesar figures out he is not like the other children in the neighborhood. Rodman is forced to give up Caesar to an "Ape Sanctuary" and there begins some of the most exhilarating revolutionary action I've ever seen.\n\nTechnically, this film is massive. The work WETA Digital did with motion capture (mo-cap) is truly a wonder to behold. Visual Effects Supervisor with WETA Digital Joe Letteri stated that they built on the technology used in "Avatar" to produce the most realistic and accurate portrayal of the actors suited to play the Simians. Andy Serkis (Gollum from "Lord of the Rings" and Kong from "King Kong") plays chimp Caesar. Serkis manages to fool all of us into believing he is a real animal with super intelligence. His facial emotions and mannerisms should most certainly nominate him for an Oscar. There is a real connection that the audience feels with Caesar and it is all thanks to Serkis' work. Without such an experienced mo-cap actor, this film would not have been such a success.\n\nNot only is the technology used to create the revolution amazing, the action is top notch as well. Many times I found myself with my jaw on the floor from the intense sequences put to screen. Everything from a simple terrifying look from an angry ape to the full out battle on the Golden Gate Bridge was pulled off without a hitch. Many points to the pacing of the films action as it could have been the crutch that killed this beast of a film. One of the most amazing scenes in my opinion is when a group of apes are fleeing over top a suburban neighborhood through the trees. While this is going on we see some people on the street while leaves upon leaves are falling to the ground. This level of detail is apparent in every shot, brilliant work by the production team.\n\nMy only problems with this film is the acting from Franco and Freida Pinto, who plays the love interest. They both seemed to "phone it in" as it were. They were not overly impressive and just seemed stale. Maybe the director wanted them to tone it down so that Serkis would have more of an impact acting as a voiceless chimp. Either way, as I said in the beginning, this film wasn't about the humans. It's about compassion, freedom and understanding and on those levels the film is a grand success.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":508228,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-08-05","keywords":"ape,chimpanzee,planet of the apes,alzheimer's disease,when animals attack","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1615502617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Trailer #2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012501/","name":"Rupert Wyatt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415425/","name":"Rick Jaffa"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798646/","name":"Amanda Silver"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0099541/","name":"Pierre Boulle"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This level of detail is apparent in every shot, brilliant work by the production team.\n\nMy only problems with this film is the acting from Franco and Freida Pinto, who plays the love interest. They both seemed to "phone it in" as it were. They were not overly impressive and just seemed stale. Maybe the director wanted them to tone it down so that Serkis would have more of an impact acting as a voiceless chimp. Either way, as I said in the beginning, this film wasn't about the humans. It's about compassion, freedom and understanding and on those levels the film is a grand success.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":508228,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-08-05","keywords":"ape,chimpanzee,planet of the apes,alzheimer's disease,when animals attack","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1615502617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Trailer #2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012501/","name":"Rupert Wyatt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415425/","name":"Rick Jaffa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798646/","name":"Amanda Silver","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0099541/","name":"Pierre Boulle"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This deals with the story of New Zealand's intrepid mountaineer Robert "Rob" Edwin Hall : Jason Clarke , who on May 10, 1996, successfully led 19 clients to the summit without a single fatality , but subsequently , things go wrong . Rob Hall together with Scott Fischer: Jake Gyllenhaal , teamed up on a joint expedition . All of them set out to scale a famous and risked mountain to ascend Mount Everest only to come face to face with a relentless fight for survival when they start their final ascent since the peak and descend to the base campament and challenging the harshest conditions and imaginable odds .\n\n Nice film with spectacular scenes , snowbound , thrills , emotion , a lot of ropes ,and piolets ; and , of course , fight for life in which at the end, a furious blizzard struck and they have to survive at whatever means , facing off blistering winds and freezing temperatures . Beautiful Nepal scenary fails to totally compensate for a number of slow-moving scenes . Each person's true nature is revealed as they scale the peak , which many climbers have defied and failed in previous attempts, but , finally the two teams must endure in an epic battle to survive against nearly impossible risks . The trip to scale the first highest peak involves a long palaver among them , and much parley between persons of different countries , cultures or level of sophistication . As the climbers argue with other partners , porters , challenges from old rivals and beyond the cliche dialogue . As the main issue results to be a violent storm strikes the mountain, engulfing the adventurers in one of the fiercest blizzards ever , as they suffer several dangers , in which the climbers encounter innumerable odds along the way , including an ascent of sheer rock face , an avalanche and a fall down perpendicular mountain ice . Protagonists give good acting delivering philosophical debating , at times .The main cast and support cast are pretty good , full of known actors as John Hawkes , Emily Watson , Sam Worthington , Keira Knightley ,Vanessa Kirby , Clive Standen , Robin Wright , Naoko Mori , Elizabeth Debicki , Michael Kelly , among others . The film is frankly well ; however, slightly overwrought ,with several dreary lapses , but exciting and stirring .This one belongs to ¨Climbling Subgenre¨ with important films such as " The White Tower" with Glenn Ford , Claude Rains , " The Eiger sanction" with Clint Eastwood, George Kennedy, Jack Cassidy and "K2¨by Frank Roddan with Matt Craven , Michael Biehn and Julia Nickson .\n\nIt contains a sensitive as well as thrilling musical score by Dario Marianelli . Impressive photography by Salvatore Tonino who does wonders shooting the moutainous outdoors , showing impressive landscapes and breathtaking mountains . It was actually shot on location in South Base Camp, Mount Everest, Nepal , Tenzing-Hillary Airport, Lukla, Nepal ,Namche Bazaar, Kathmandu , Nepal and Val Senales, Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy . The motion picture was well directed by Baltasar Kormakur whose intention is made clear early on : the hard climbing and the omnipotence of nature as metaphor , as well as a sour denounce on the increasing demand for expeditions to Everest, being based on real events . Baltasar who was born in Reykjavik, Iceland , he is a writer/Producer/filmmaker, an artisan who has directed a number of decent movies of all kinds of genres . As he has directed¨Contraband," which was a remake of Oskar Johansson's "Reykjavik Rotterdam," and he produced through his Blueeyes Productions, along with Working Title Films. Kormákur's next films were the thriller "2 Guns," starring Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg, ¨The missionary , ¨The Oath¨ , ¨Adrift¨ , among others . Rating : 7/10 . Better than average .","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":207781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Biography"],"datePublished":"2015-09-16","keywords":"mount everest,mountain climbing,survival,mountain,man versus nature","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"IMAX Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946006297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NjUxNDE3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE1OTY0NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NjUxNDE3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE1OTY0NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the incredible events surrounding an attempt to reach the summit of the world's highest mountain, Everest documents the awe-inspiring journey of two different expeditions challenged beyond their  limits by one of the fiercest snowstorms ever encountered by mankind.

This deals with the story of New Zealand's intrepid mountaineer Robert "Rob" Edwin Hall : Jason Clarke , who on May 10, 1996, successfully led 19 clients to the summit without a single fatality , but subsequently , things go wrong . Rob Hall together with Scott Fischer: Jake Gyllenhaal , teamed up on a joint expedition . All of them set out to scale a famous and risked mountain to ascend Mount Everest only to come face to face with a relentless fight for survival when they start their final ascent since the peak and descend to the base campament and challenging the harshest conditions and imaginable odds .\n\n Nice film with spectacular scenes , snowbound , thrills , emotion , a lot of ropes ,and piolets ; and , of course , fight for life in which at the end, a furious blizzard struck and they have to survive at whatever means , facing off blistering winds and freezing temperatures . Beautiful Nepal scenary fails to totally compensate for a number of slow-moving scenes . Each person's true nature is revealed as they scale the peak , which many climbers have defied and failed in previous attempts, but , finally the two teams must endure in an epic battle to survive against nearly impossible risks . The trip to scale the first highest peak involves a long palaver among them , and much parley between persons of different countries , cultures or level of sophistication . As the climbers argue with other partners , porters , challenges from old rivals and beyond the cliche dialogue . As the main issue results to be a violent storm strikes the mountain, engulfing the adventurers in one of the fiercest blizzards ever , as they suffer several dangers , in which the climbers encounter innumerable odds along the way , including an ascent of sheer rock face , an avalanche and a fall down perpendicular mountain ice . Protagonists give good acting delivering philosophical debating , at times .The main cast and support cast are pretty good , full of known actors as John Hawkes , Emily Watson , Sam Worthington , Keira Knightley ,Vanessa Kirby , Clive Standen , Robin Wright , Naoko Mori , Elizabeth Debicki , Michael Kelly , among others . The film is frankly well ; however, slightly overwrought ,with several dreary lapses , but exciting and stirring .This one belongs to ¨Climbling Subgenre¨ with important films such as " The White Tower" with Glenn Ford , Claude Rains , " The Eiger sanction" with Clint Eastwood, George Kennedy, Jack Cassidy and "K2¨by Frank Roddan with Matt Craven , Michael Biehn and Julia Nickson .\n\nIt contains a sensitive as well as thrilling musical score by Dario Marianelli . Impressive photography by Salvatore Tonino who does wonders shooting the moutainous outdoors , showing impressive landscapes and breathtaking mountains . It was actually shot on location in South Base Camp, Mount Everest, Nepal , Tenzing-Hillary Airport, Lukla, Nepal ,Namche Bazaar, Kathmandu , Nepal and Val Senales, Trentino-Alto Adige, Italy . The motion picture was well directed by Baltasar Kormakur whose intention is made clear early on : the hard climbing and the omnipotence of nature as metaphor , as well as a sour denounce on the increasing demand for expeditions to Everest, being based on real events . Baltasar who was born in Reykjavik, Iceland , he is a writer/Producer/filmmaker, an artisan who has directed a number of decent movies of all kinds of genres . As he has directed¨Contraband," which was a remake of Oskar Johansson's "Reykjavik Rotterdam," and he produced through his Blueeyes Productions, along with Working Title Films. Kormákur's next films were the thriller "2 Guns," starring Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg, ¨The missionary , ¨The Oath¨ , ¨Adrift¨ , among others . Rating : 7/10 . Better than average .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":207781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Biography"],"datePublished":"2015-09-16","keywords":"mount everest,mountain climbing,survival,mountain,man versus nature","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"IMAX Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946006297","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NjUxNDE3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE1OTY0NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg1NjUxNDE3NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDE1OTY0NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the incredible events surrounding an attempt to reach the summit of the world's highest mountain, Everest documents the awe-inspiring journey of two different expeditions challenged beyond their  limits by one of the fiercest snowstorms ever encountered by mankind.

While it may not be as bloody as Kingdom of Heaven, the action still remains exciting and brutal. People who have not seen that film will be disappointed by the lack of action and scenes that are too long.\n\nWhile I found the film to be exciting, I couldn't help but realise that this would have been great if it was a 15 (UK age certificate) rather than a 12a. The first action sequence is great as English soldiers attack a French castle but it felt restricted that you would never see any blood when someone is killed; a soldier is shot in the neck by an arrow but other than the arrow, they look completely fine. Early on a character dies but from the way it was edited, you would never have known. A film where the violence is as savage and as brutal as this, requires you to feel as if the characters are in great danger.\n\nA lot has been said about Russell Crowe and his acting in the film but I found little to complain about. He suited his role well. The supporting cast including Mark Strong, Cate Blanchett, Max von Sydow, William Hurt, Kevin Durand and Oscar Isaac are fantastic. They are all completely immersed into their roles. I never felt that someone else could have been casted instead. \n\nThe cinematography is also really good but if only it was not let down by the editing. As a sword or axe is flung towards an enemies head, it cuts straight after the impact, loosing a sense of realism. The hurts the film much later on in the final action sequence.\n\nThe film maintained my interest and the final action sequence was exciting. This is a film worth watching but if you are expecting the next Gladiator, I suggest waiting for the director's cut on DVD/ Blu-ray.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":259681,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-05-12","keywords":"archer,robin hood character,england,1190s,king of england","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robin Hood: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi73860121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3ODEzMjMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU4MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3ODEzMjMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU4MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of an archer in the army of Richard Coeur de Lion who fights against the Norman invaders and becomes the legendary hero known as Robin Hood."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532193/","name":"Matthew Macfadyen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0717550/","name":"Ethan Reiff"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0903456/","name":"Cyrus Voris"}],"duration":"PT2H20M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

People who have not seen that film will be disappointed by the lack of action and scenes that are too long.\n\nWhile I found the film to be exciting, I couldn't help but realise that this would have been great if it was a 15 (UK age certificate) rather than a 12a. The first action sequence is great as English soldiers attack a French castle but it felt restricted that you would never see any blood when someone is killed; a soldier is shot in the neck by an arrow but other than the arrow, they look completely fine. Early on a character dies but from the way it was edited, you would never have known. A film where the violence is as savage and as brutal as this, requires you to feel as if the characters are in great danger.\n\nA lot has been said about Russell Crowe and his acting in the film but I found little to complain about. He suited his role well. The supporting cast including Mark Strong, Cate Blanchett, Max von Sydow, William Hurt, Kevin Durand and Oscar Isaac are fantastic. They are all completely immersed into their roles. I never felt that someone else could have been casted instead. \n\nThe cinematography is also really good but if only it was not let down by the editing. As a sword or axe is flung towards an enemies head, it cuts straight after the impact, loosing a sense of realism. The hurts the film much later on in the final action sequence.\n\nThe film maintained my interest and the final action sequence was exciting. This is a film worth watching but if you are expecting the next Gladiator, I suggest waiting for the director's cut on DVD/ Blu-ray.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":259681,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-05-12","keywords":"archer,robin hood character,england,1190s,king of england","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robin Hood: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi73860121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3ODEzMjMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU4MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3ODEzMjMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU4MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of an archer in the army of Richard Coeur de Lion who fights against the Norman invaders and becomes the legendary hero known as Robin Hood.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532193/","name":"Matthew Macfadyen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0717550/","name":"Ethan Reiff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0903456/","name":"Cyrus Voris"],"duration":"PT2H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It certainly wasn't easy to squeeze half a man's life into 2 hours but I think they've kept a good balance between the beautiful under-the-sea shots and the family ups and downs and the financial challenges he faced. Obviously, they did not have much time for any in-depth analysis, mostly walked us through the main milestones of his life. But the film is shot and edited perfectly. The scenes just flow from one to another, speeding up and slowing down as needed, as kids grow, as decisions need to be made, as people leave and return. The film is not all rosy and it did not shy away from some of the less pleasant sides of the great man. But I think it was handled with good tact, they did not dwell on it but kind of just mentioned it, hey, we are all human after all. And of course, there are enough shots for you to go wow that's a fricking beautiful world down there.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5357,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-10-12","keywords":"ecology,husband wife conflict,husband wife relationship,begins with a flashback,airplane accident","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1223407897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDVmOGNkNDItNTZiNi00ZWMyLWI5YTItYjRiM2QyNmFjZWM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDVmOGNkNDItNTZiNi00ZWMyLWI5YTItYjRiM2QyNmFjZWM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"Highly influential and a fearlessly ambitious pioneer, innovator, filmmaker, researcher and conservationist, Jacques-Yves Cousteau's aquatic adventure covers roughly thirty years of an inarguably rich in achievements life."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933727/","name":"Lambert Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2582755/","name":"Pierre Niney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1362432/","name":"Jérôme Salle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060537/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0571461/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0593456/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1362432/","name":"Jérôme Salle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1668171/","name":"Laurent Turner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0184151/","name":"Jean-Michel Cousteau"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It certainly wasn't easy to squeeze half a man's life into 2 hours but I think they've kept a good balance between the beautiful under-the-sea shots and the family ups and downs and the financial challenges he faced. Obviously, they did not have much time for any in-depth analysis, mostly walked us through the main milestones of his life. But the film is shot and edited perfectly. The scenes just flow from one to another, speeding up and slowing down as needed, as kids grow, as decisions need to be made, as people leave and return. The film is not all rosy and it did not shy away from some of the less pleasant sides of the great man. But I think it was handled with good tact, they did not dwell on it but kind of just mentioned it, hey, we are all human after all. And of course, there are enough shots for you to go wow that's a fricking beautiful world down there.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5357,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-10-12","keywords":"ecology,husband wife conflict,husband wife relationship,begins with a flashback,airplane accident","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1223407897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDVmOGNkNDItNTZiNi00ZWMyLWI5YTItYjRiM2QyNmFjZWM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDVmOGNkNDItNTZiNi00ZWMyLWI5YTItYjRiM2QyNmFjZWM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"Highly influential and a fearlessly ambitious pioneer, innovator, filmmaker, researcher and conservationist, Jacques-Yves Cousteau's aquatic adventure covers roughly thirty years of an inarguably rich in achievements life.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933727/","name":"Lambert Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2582755/","name":"Pierre Niney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1362432/","name":"Jérôme Salle"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060537/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0571461/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0593456/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1362432/","name":"Jérôme Salle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1668171/","name":"Laurent Turner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0184151/","name":"Jean-Michel Cousteau"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After this happens Michael who lives in the Bahamas with his wife and daughter studying sea snails, visits his mother and asks her to come down there with him and the family. Ellen wants Michael to not go near the water, but he convinces her that it's all fine, since great whites don't like the warm water. But hold on as the shark that killed Sean is now stalking the family and has only one thing on mind - to wipe out the Brody family.\n\nLeave those Brody's alone! Err, what crud  yeah reading the outline above you'll be just rolling your eyes at how ridiculous this film does get. The last sequel "Jaws 3" was a bad film, but I actually enjoyed it to some degree, but here the personal agenda format was just rubbish and the special connection between the Brody's and the shark was just plain risible. I just found this clunker quite lacklustre with it's melodramatic, soap opera of a story and it's lack of thrills and suspense. It was quite a drag and it did have that cheap TV feel about it, despite it's more than capable cast. The only thing that I thought was decent was the terrifyingly, bloody and macabre opening death. Although, few of the performances ( mainly Lance Guest in the key role of Michael Brody and Michael Caine's happy- go-lucky pilot character Hoagie ) made sure that the film didn't sink too fast. While, the rest were simply one-note and Mario Van Peebles' Jamaican accent was just so dodgy. But what was in need of a life-jacket was the dire script that threw out many awful lines of dialogues. "I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder. I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy." What?! The repetitively, diluted story is full of crock with many implausible situations and it doesn't leave too much up to the imagination. Was the writer and the director drinking sea water on this project? Maybe so, because Michael's wife's supposed piece of art resembled  what? I just don't see it. Well, the sprawling beach lines and crystal blue waters were a nice sight. Too bad that the mechanical, but crooked plastic shark slowly got in the way. The ramshackle design looked dreadful, but the makers didn't seem to notice because they constantly kept showing the abomination in it's full glory. I even got the feeling that the shark just couldn't stop grinning. The (few) shark attacks are rather furious and quite graphic, but I found the latter ones to be laughable because of the execution. Really, it goes all out to outdo itself, but this puddle turns out to be simply inept in mostly every single department. Overall, a fatally disastrous novel production that never should have seen open waters and you won't be laughing too much, but you'll be a daze of bemusement to how this franchise fell apart.\n\nIt's definitely as bad as its reputation.

But five years ago we didn't have the kind of technical wizardry we have now; witness Toy Story, the new Star Wars, or any of the recent Disney films. Five years ago, the mouse would have been a regular rodent with a not-too-subtle voiceover. Remember Homeward Bound, the movie about the two dogs and the cat? There was no computer animation there, and you were basically left with three animals who appeared to cavort onscreen while some humans talked in the background. \n\nSo now here we have Stuart Little, a tiny little mouse (voiced by the always-fresh Michael J. Fox) who has lived his entire life in an orphanage. One day, the Littles (Hugh Laurie and Geena Davis) come to the orphanage looking for a brother for their young son George (Jonathan Lipnicki). Of course, with so many cute little boys and girls, it's impossible to choose - until they come across Stuart, who seems smart, funny, and wise beyond his years. George isn't too fond of Stuart at the start - he expected something a little... um, taller - but this is a kids' movie, after all, so eventually they bond as only a boy and his mouse brother can - by winning a boat race against a nasty bully.\n\nThere are a few storylines jammed into this 85-minute extravaganza. Stuart wants to learn about his natural parents, the family cat wants to kill him, and the parents want Stuart and George to get along. The way most of it plays out will come off as standard movie fare - predictable to those of us over 10, perhaps - but the winning charm of Fox as the loveable Stuart coupled with an engaging and appealing cast of characters makes up for any familiarity you might feel. On top of it all - the special effects. Now, I'm not one to heap overweening praise on special effects, but at no point during the viewing of this movie did I consider Stuart (or the cat, voiced by Nathan Lane) to be an artificial computer creation. Sure, you have to suspend belief a little bit for this movie, but hey - don't you have to do that with almost any movie, anyway?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":129654,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2000-03-15","keywords":"alley cat,cat actor,boat,boy,scene during end credits","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stuart Little","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4253417753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU1ODBiZGQtNzRkNy00ODRhLWI2ZjktMjZiZWI0YjYzOWRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU1ODBiZGQtNzRkNy00ODRhLWI2ZjktMjZiZWI0YjYzOWRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000150/","name":"Michael J.

The mouse Stuart (voice by Michael J. Fox) has an adventure in the big city together with the house cat Snowbell (voice by Nathan Lane) because the bird he loves (voice by Melanie Griffiths) is taken by Falcon (James Woods). Of course the family Little (with Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie and son George played by Jonathan Lipnicki) is looking for Stuart.\n\nA movie like this is allowed to be predictable. You know it will end happy and that is the way it should end. A movie like this needs some charming, sweet and funny moments and 'Stuart Little 2' has those moments. Every moment between Margalo the bird and Stuart is sweet and charming and especially the moments with the real characters are sometimes very funny. Another nice thing is the creation of the mouse and bird itself. Since Stuart or Margalo is in almost every scene in the movie there is always something nice to look at. This is a perfect movie for the whole family.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52320,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-09-04","keywords":"live action cgi hybrid,animal character name as title,stuart little character,man wears eyeglasses,boy wears eyeglasses","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stuart Little 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4035313945","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFiZTk0NzQtNWE4Ny00Mzk4LWFhZDYtMzBlMTk2YWI2MDIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFiZTk0NzQtNWE4Ny00Mzk4LWFhZDYtMzBlMTk2YWI2MDIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000150/","name":"Michael J.

The mouse Stuart (voice by Michael J. Fox) has an adventure in the big city together with the house cat Snowbell (voice by Nathan Lane) because the bird he loves (voice by Melanie Griffiths) is taken by Falcon (James Woods). Of course the family Little (with Geena Davis, Hugh Laurie and son George played by Jonathan Lipnicki) is looking for Stuart.\n\nA movie like this is allowed to be predictable. You know it will end happy and that is the way it should end. A movie like this needs some charming, sweet and funny moments and 'Stuart Little 2' has those moments. Every moment between Margalo the bird and Stuart is sweet and charming and especially the moments with the real characters are sometimes very funny. Another nice thing is the creation of the mouse and bird itself. Since Stuart or Margalo is in almost every scene in the movie there is always something nice to look at. This is a perfect movie for the whole family.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52320,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-09-04","keywords":"live action cgi hybrid,animal character name as title,stuart little character,man wears eyeglasses,boy wears eyeglasses","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stuart Little 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4035313945","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFiZTk0NzQtNWE4Ny00Mzk4LWFhZDYtMzBlMTk2YWI2MDIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFiZTk0NzQtNWE4Ny00Mzk4LWFhZDYtMzBlMTk2YWI2MDIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000150/","name":"Michael J.

Then again, perhaps it IS a plague when considering they decided to make a book into a 90-minute film, but I don't know.

The titular villain only appears pretty late in the film. The characters are sideshows, most of them. I really can't say I liked very much about this film at all. Then again, perhaps it IS a plague when considering they decided to make a book into a 90-minute film, but I don't know. This whole film, to me, felt like an unnecessary sideshow, and the ending doesn't help it at all. Maybe a rental when it's available, but otherwise don't bother. This was a bigger disappointment than Terminator: Salvation even if watched with lower expectations.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9036,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2010-01-27","keywords":"spiderweb,elf,male protagonist,live action and animation,shot back to back","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1411125/","name":"Selena Gomez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1082477/","name":"Omar Sy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000108/","name":"Luc Besson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0127526/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305372/","name":"Patrice Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000108/","name":"Luc Besson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297771/","name":"Céline Garcia"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

[+59%]","reviewBody":"The familiar rom-com beats are too hard to ignore in The Broken Hearts Gallery, but what holds it all together is a spunky little (lead) performance from Geraldine Viswanathan (who plays Lucy, an art gallery assistant). With a plot that's tailor-made for a romantic comedy (it has got a lot to do with Lucy's heartbreaks and the souvenirs she keeps from those broken relationships), The Broken Hearts Gallery makes the city of New York look like a standout character. Darc Montgomery plays Nick, the owner of a work-in-progress hotel, who bumps into Lucy in a rather unusual meet-cute. Their second (chance) encounter felt contrived as hell though.\n\nWhen the duo decides to convert part of the hotel space into a gallery for exhibiting souvenirs from relationships that fell through, the film picks up speed, charm, and some romantic vibes. I didn't expect many surprises in the screenplay (which occasionally descends into downright cheesiness) but what bothered me was the distinct lack of humor. Here and there, we get a chuckle or two, courtesy of the largely silent Jeff (Nathan Dales), Eva Woolf (a spirited Bernadette Peters), and Marcos (Arturo Castro). The Broken Hearts Gallery wholly rides on Geraldine's star-making role and the chemistry she shares with Dacre (which was fine in parts, yes!).\n\nWhile the inclusion of multi-ethnic (there's Utkarsh Ambudkar playing Max Vora, presumably of Indian origin) and LGBTQ (Philippa Soo plays Nadine, a lesbian) characters is commendable, they often recede conveniently into the background for the central plot to play out. It's not a bad film by any measure (Alar Kivilo's cinematography is a plus); The Broken Hearts Gallery, written and directed by Natalie Krinsky, is certainly one for audiences who savor their romantic comedies with a tolerable dose of clichés and syrupy feels.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6123,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-09-11","keywords":"art curator,new york city,breakup,art gallery,boyfriend girlfriend relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3418013977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTBiNjY3YWUtNmM1MS00OTUxLTk1ZmItZjI4MjRlNzE5ZThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTBiNjY3YWUtNmM1MS00OTUxLTk1ZmItZjI4MjRlNzE5ZThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"After a break up, a young woman decides to start a gallery where people can leave trinkets from past relationships."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6543093/","name":"Geraldine Viswanathan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4223882/","name":"Dacre Montgomery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2064295/","name":"Utkarsh Ambudkar"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3706989/","name":"Natalie Krinsky"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276952/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3706989/","name":"Natalie Krinsky"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

[+59%]","reviewBody":"The familiar rom-com beats are too hard to ignore in The Broken Hearts Gallery, but what holds it all together is a spunky little (lead) performance from Geraldine Viswanathan (who plays Lucy, an art gallery assistant). With a plot that's tailor-made for a romantic comedy (it has got a lot to do with Lucy's heartbreaks and the souvenirs she keeps from those broken relationships), The Broken Hearts Gallery makes the city of New York look like a standout character. Darc Montgomery plays Nick, the owner of a work-in-progress hotel, who bumps into Lucy in a rather unusual meet-cute. Their second (chance) encounter felt contrived as hell though.\n\nWhen the duo decides to convert part of the hotel space into a gallery for exhibiting souvenirs from relationships that fell through, the film picks up speed, charm, and some romantic vibes. I didn't expect many surprises in the screenplay (which occasionally descends into downright cheesiness) but what bothered me was the distinct lack of humor. Here and there, we get a chuckle or two, courtesy of the largely silent Jeff (Nathan Dales), Eva Woolf (a spirited Bernadette Peters), and Marcos (Arturo Castro). The Broken Hearts Gallery wholly rides on Geraldine's star-making role and the chemistry she shares with Dacre (which was fine in parts, yes!).\n\nWhile the inclusion of multi-ethnic (there's Utkarsh Ambudkar playing Max Vora, presumably of Indian origin) and LGBTQ (Philippa Soo plays Nadine, a lesbian) characters is commendable, they often recede conveniently into the background for the central plot to play out. It's not a bad film by any measure (Alar Kivilo's cinematography is a plus); The Broken Hearts Gallery, written and directed by Natalie Krinsky, is certainly one for audiences who savor their romantic comedies with a tolerable dose of clichés and syrupy feels.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6123,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-09-11","keywords":"art curator,new york city,breakup,art gallery,boyfriend girlfriend relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3418013977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTBiNjY3YWUtNmM1MS00OTUxLTk1ZmItZjI4MjRlNzE5ZThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTBiNjY3YWUtNmM1MS00OTUxLTk1ZmItZjI4MjRlNzE5ZThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"After a break up, a young woman decides to start a gallery where people can leave trinkets from past relationships.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6543093/","name":"Geraldine Viswanathan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4223882/","name":"Dacre Montgomery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2064295/","name":"Utkarsh Ambudkar"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3706989/","name":"Natalie Krinsky"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276952/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3706989/","name":"Natalie Krinsky"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Cannot judge which one is better","reviewBody":"Finally saw LITTLE WOMEN 2019. Didn't expected much cause I really liked 94 version by Gillian Armstrong with Winona Ryder , Gabriel Byrne , Trini Alvarado , Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon. Well, the casting was something that I cannot judge which one is better. Both are so so great. But Christian Bale 94, I liked better than Timothée Chalamet 2019 (Although he was good but didn't overcome THE Christian).\n\nTwo things really grabbed me.\n\n1. The camera and light. The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make. They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice. Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.\n\n2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music. In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie &amp; Julia and Philomena.\n\nI cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.) Something that was different with the 94 version.\n\nIt is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164531,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-25","keywords":"aspiring writer,poverty,women's rights,mother daughter relationship,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2655304729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer-director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) has crafted a Little Women that draws on both the classic novel and the writings of Louisa May Alcott, and unfolds as the author’s alter ego, Jo March, reflects back and forth on her fictional life."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6073955/","name":"Florence Pugh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0532247/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017301/","name":"Louisa May Alcott"}],"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Didn't expected much cause I really liked 94 version by Gillian Armstrong with Winona Ryder , Gabriel Byrne , Trini Alvarado , Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon. Well, the casting was something that I cannot judge which one is better. Both are so so great. But Christian Bale 94, I liked better than Timothée Chalamet 2019 (Although he was good but didn't overcome THE Christian).\n\nTwo things really grabbed me.\n\n1. The camera and light. The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make. They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice. Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.\n\n2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music. In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie &amp; Julia and Philomena.\n\nI cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.) Something that was different with the 94 version.\n\nIt is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164531,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-25","keywords":"aspiring writer,poverty,women's rights,mother daughter relationship,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2655304729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer-director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) has crafted a Little Women that draws on both the classic novel and the writings of Louisa May Alcott, and unfolds as the author’s alter ego, Jo March, reflects back and forth on her fictional life.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6073955/","name":"Florence Pugh"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0532247/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017301/","name":"Louisa May Alcott"],"duration":"PT2H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.\n\nWhat I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nAs far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.\n\nSpy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For me, it is to be moved. To laugh, to cry, to be frightened, to be in awe, to be amused in a gentle way. This movie did this to me in all 5 ways. I am Mr. Ordinary - I have been lucky enough to be born into a loving family, I have wooed a certain number of women, I have married and enjoyed the highs and lows of having my own family, I have lost my parents. I try in my own way to appreciate others and acknowledge that they are trying to make their way in life. This movie defines me. If you miss it this time, don't worry. You'll catch it later. Most people interested in cinema will see it at some stage. My advice is to go and see it now. It's not perfect - it's a bit English, a bit middle class, the story is preposterous. But the sentiment, the message hits the spot. Take one of your significant others. Take a first date. Take a box of tissues.

For me, it is to be moved. To laugh, to cry, to be frightened, to be in awe, to be amused in a gentle way. This movie did this to me in all 5 ways. I am Mr. Ordinary - I have been lucky enough to be born into a loving family, I have wooed a certain number of women, I have married and enjoyed the highs and lows of having my own family, I have lost my parents. I try in my own way to appreciate others and acknowledge that they are trying to make their way in life. This movie defines me. If you miss it this time, don't worry. You'll catch it later. Most people interested in cinema will see it at some stage. My advice is to go and see it now. It's not perfect - it's a bit English, a bit middle class, the story is preposterous. But the sentiment, the message hits the spot. Take one of your significant others. Take a first date. Take a box of tissues. It's the reason you go to the cinema.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321812,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2013-09-04","keywords":"time travel,father son relationship,family relationships,wedding,marriage","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi802400281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MTAyNzgyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ4ODI1MDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5MTAyNzgyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ4ODI1MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"At the age of 21, Tim discovers he can travel in time and change what happens and has happened in his own life.

I have yet to see The Hangover Part 2, so I can't comment on any similarities/differences that might or might not exist.

At the center of this battle is Helen, a newly acquired "friend"—via the merging of two exclusive social circles—who begins taking over the wedding plans for Lillian (Rudolph). Annie (Wiig) makes it her mission to take out this she-devil, and what follows is the setup for one of the more memorable meltdowns (among a plethora of other things) to come along in quite some time. Bridesmaids is also peppered with the sort of humor that made movies like Superbad and Knocked Up so funny—it's observant and kitschy in that it rightly jabs several other films that have braved similar issues. In fact, the previously mentioned Hangover is, in at least a very minute way, one of these movies. In what initially appears to be a sad "bow" to The Hangover as king of the pre-wedding funnies, the girls decide to go to Vegas for Lillian's bachelorette party. This ends up being a perfectly welcome curve ball, though, as screenwriters Wiig and Mumolo brilliantly utilize the length of the plane trip to said destination to further flesh out their characters and create an impressively humorous string of in-flight mishaps.\n\nThere are a number of other contributors who make Bridesmaids work extraordinarily well, but, as is the case with any solid piece of cinema, it's best if you set aside some time to take in the whole thing in one fell swoop and let it unravel of its own volition.

The romance side of the film kicks in about 30 minutes in, so for the first act of the film it really has some pretty damn good laughs. There was a pretty steady flow of jokes and comedy gags throughout the film and you have to give most of that credit to Amy Schumer who was incredibly hilarious in this. She is one of the funniest people out there today and she proves it in this film with perfect comedic timing. Her style of comedy is so blunt and fairly subtle at some moments and that makes it very unpredictable so she can hit you with great jokes left right and centre and you never see it coming. \n\nNow even though she does manage to pull it off the best, Bill Hader and the supporting cast are also hilarious and provided a lot more laughs than i had initially expected. Bill Hader of course is hilarious and he works in this film really well but he was slightly overshadowed by Amy at some moments in the film, and the large supporting cast also took away from him a little. But man were the supporting cast hilarious, i have to give credit to LeBron James because that guy is hilarious. He was one of the biggest surprises of the film, almost every scene he was in i couldn't stop laughing, it looks like Apatow and Schumer managed to teach him a few things in terms of comedy. \n\nAs well as being jam packed with great hilarious moments this movie really had a basic but also pretty good rom-com story thrown in there. And it worked well, they didn't just force any random plot in there to add to the run-time. For the first two acts they did a great job at blending those comedic scenes and romantic more plot driven scenes well so they could switch between the two vary naturally. But the third act for me didn't work as much. The romantic side began to take charge and the comedy took a back seat. There were still some pretty funny scenes in the third act but it felt uneven tonally and a little jumpy. There was a pretty sad moment at one point then it tries to crack a few jokes immediately after then going back to the romantic stuff and it didn;t work for me as well as the rest of the film. I don't think it was an issue of being too long just needed a little more refining towards the end. But otherwise it was a great funny movie. \n\nAmy Schumer's comedy may not be for everyone so those who are not a fan of her 'Inside Amy Schumer' skits probably won't like this as much but as far as a romantic comedy goes, this one was actually very good and had quite a bit in there for everyone. - 7.1\n\nALSO, on last thing, i just checked the list of cast and was surprised beyond belief when i found out that Tilda bloody Swinton was in this film. Like WTF? she was completely unrecognisable and hilarious, so see if you can pick her out when you see the film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":133527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2015-08-26","keywords":"actress playing herself,funeral,actress shares first name with character,written by star,writer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2692067353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMDI2MjIyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUyMzYwNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMDI2MjIyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUyMzYwNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Having thought that monogamy was never possible, a commitment-phobic career woman may have to face her fears when she meets a good guy."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2154960/","name":"Amy Schumer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352778/","name":"Bill Hader"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488953/","name":"Brie Larson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169264/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2154960/","name":"Amy Schumer"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But otherwise it was a great funny movie. \n\nAmy Schumer's comedy may not be for everyone so those who are not a fan of her 'Inside Amy Schumer' skits probably won't like this as much but as far as a romantic comedy goes, this one was actually very good and had quite a bit in there for everyone. - 7.1\n\nALSO, on last thing, i just checked the list of cast and was surprised beyond belief when i found out that Tilda bloody Swinton was in this film. Like WTF? she was completely unrecognisable and hilarious, so see if you can pick her out when you see the film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":133527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2015-08-26","keywords":"actress playing herself,funeral,actress shares first name with character,written by star,writer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2692067353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMDI2MjIyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUyMzYwNjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzMDI2MjIyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzUyMzYwNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Having thought that monogamy was never possible, a commitment-phobic career woman may have to face her fears when she meets a good guy.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2154960/","name":"Amy Schumer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352778/","name":"Bill Hader","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488953/","name":"Brie Larson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169264/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2154960/","name":"Amy Schumer"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That is if you're not too picky and can enjoy a movie without the urge of being too critical all the time. Kajillionaire is certainly not a bad movie, it's different and sometimes a bit weird, but it's definitely entertaining. The plot is about a disfunctional (or not) family that tries to get by using inventive scams to gather some money. Nothing they will get rich of, just a bunch of lowlife scams that are funny to watch. The family is played by Richard Jenkins, Debra Winger (which I didn't recognize) and Evan Rachel Wood.

That is if you're not too picky and can enjoy a movie without the urge of being too critical all the time. Kajillionaire is certainly not a bad movie, it's different and sometimes a bit weird, but it's definitely entertaining. The plot is about a disfunctional (or not) family that tries to get by using inventive scams to gather some money. Nothing they will get rich of, just a bunch of lowlife scams that are funny to watch. The family is played by Richard Jenkins, Debra Winger (which I didn't recognize) and Evan Rachel Wood. The whole crew did a good job. Kajillionaire might not be an award winning movie but it's good enough for a good movie night.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14376,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-25","keywords":"father daughter relationship,mother daughter relationship,heist,family of criminals,grifter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3764567577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ4YWQzMDAtZTkzYi00Yzc0LThjNWMtMjM3MDMzMDZlZGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ4YWQzMDAtZTkzYi00Yzc0LThjNWMtMjM3MDMzMDZlZGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"From acclaimed writer/director Miranda July comes a profoundly moving and wildly original comedy.

It still works somehow, especially because of the main actors. Though it is a bit strange that Aylin is playing a character called Aylin. If you knew her real name that is of course, which I did.\n\nApart from that, there is also a lot of breaking, but in a way you'd expect the movie to break with prejudices. Some of the jokes do work and some don't. Ulmen is playing both "parts" with detail. Even if you may think that the transformation might be a tad too much, it's working in the overall context of the movie. Not to mention that it is necessary for the overall dramatic this builds up ...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":511,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2015-10-29","keywords":"male chauvinism,bare chested male,cologne germany,football fan,soccer fan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1214637/","name":"Christian Ulmen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2521682/","name":"Aylin Tezel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1502469/","name":"Dar Salim"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0906247/","name":"Christof Wahl"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0163418/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0309458/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0143779/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0626604/","name":"Moritz Netenjakob","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0772639/","name":"Roger Schmelzer"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.\n\nWhat I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nAs far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.\n\nSpy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.\n\nWhat I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs.

I never thought that playing cello could lead to such flaming results  and I used to play it. 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65505,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1987-06-12","keywords":"divorced woman,windstorm,verbose speech,1980s,hand on woman's butt","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Witches of Eastwick","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2046165273","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWYzMmFiZDItMTRkYS00ZDZhLTljZDAtZTI4M2Y3NDJlMjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWYzMmFiZDItMTRkYS00ZDZhLTljZDAtZTI4M2Y3NDJlMjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

It stars Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, Angelina Jolie, Jared Leto, Anthony Hopkins, Rosario Dawson, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Christopher Plummer. Music is by Vangelis and cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto.\n\nAlexander is an historical epic based on the life of Alexander the Great. Off the bat I have to say that this "Final Cut" version of the film is the only one I have seen. Upon its initial home format release - the first theatrical version - I lasted an hour and 15 minutes before growing restless and sought enjoyment elsewhere. Consequently as a massive fan of historical epics through the years, it has been a constant nagging itch for me to see Alexander in its entirety. So with Oliver Stone tinkering away with versions - convinced he has made a worthwhile epic - I finally delved in.\n\nThe Final Cut, as far as I'm aware, is a vast improvement on that savagely received theatrical release, well that is said by those who tried again instead of calling quits at the first production. Straight away I could see the difference, where once was a plodding first hour, now sits a vibrancy, with Stone seemingly saying that he can do great action and drama, just please hang around during all the historical chatter, sexual connotation, family strife and conquering machinations, and I will enthral you as a whole.\n\nBy his own admission, Stone reveals he took on a most complex historical character and in his eyes has made a film to befit such complexity. We get a splintered narrative, as we kick off with the crux of Alexander the Great, the leader, while Alexander's childhood and family forming is interspersed at various junctures. The battles are high in intensity and blood letting - exhilarating at times - but more crucially they let us engage with the tactical "ahead of their time" manoeuvres of Alexander the Great. This version mostly flows alright, and I got to feel how Alexander's mind was working in the process, even if come pics closure I didn't fully know the man.\n\nEpically cast of course, some of them work, others not so much. Farrell's looked odd, in the way that Pitt's was in Troy (released this same year as Alexander), but apart from the accent issue he grows into the role and is fiercely committed. Jolie is just wrong for the role of domineering Olympias, worse still the scenes she does with Farrell are damp and threaten to derail the drama already built up. This latter point is more annoying given a great thread involving Dawson as Alexander's wife Roxanne is built up superbly, only to not be pulled until some drama very late in the play. The rest of the cast come through as ok for period flavours (expected for Hopkins, Plummer and Meyers, interesting as regards Leto).\n\nThis is not the life ambition masterpiece Stone wanted to make, even if he proclaims on the extras that he's happy and content with The Final Cut version. This cut still shows some cracks, but these are not seismic enough to hurt the film.

It stars Colin Farrell, Val Kilmer, Angelina Jolie, Jared Leto, Anthony Hopkins, Rosario Dawson, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Christopher Plummer. Music is by Vangelis and cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto.\n\nAlexander is an historical epic based on the life of Alexander the Great. Off the bat I have to say that this "Final Cut" version of the film is the only one I have seen. Upon its initial home format release - the first theatrical version - I lasted an hour and 15 minutes before growing restless and sought enjoyment elsewhere. Consequently as a massive fan of historical epics through the years, it has been a constant nagging itch for me to see Alexander in its entirety. So with Oliver Stone tinkering away with versions - convinced he has made a worthwhile epic - I finally delved in.\n\nThe Final Cut, as far as I'm aware, is a vast improvement on that savagely received theatrical release, well that is said by those who tried again instead of calling quits at the first production. Straight away I could see the difference, where once was a plodding first hour, now sits a vibrancy, with Stone seemingly saying that he can do great action and drama, just please hang around during all the historical chatter, sexual connotation, family strife and conquering machinations, and I will enthral you as a whole.\n\nBy his own admission, Stone reveals he took on a most complex historical character and in his eyes has made a film to befit such complexity. We get a splintered narrative, as we kick off with the crux of Alexander the Great, the leader, while Alexander's childhood and family forming is interspersed at various junctures. The battles are high in intensity and blood letting - exhilarating at times - but more crucially they let us engage with the tactical "ahead of their time" manoeuvres of Alexander the Great. This version mostly flows alright, and I got to feel how Alexander's mind was working in the process, even if come pics closure I didn't fully know the man.\n\nEpically cast of course, some of them work, others not so much. Farrell's looked odd, in the way that Pitt's was in Troy (released this same year as Alexander), but apart from the accent issue he grows into the role and is fiercely committed. Jolie is just wrong for the role of domineering Olympias, worse still the scenes she does with Farrell are damp and threaten to derail the drama already built up. This latter point is more annoying given a great thread involving Dawson as Alexander's wife Roxanne is built up superbly, only to not be pulled until some drama very late in the play. The rest of the cast come through as ok for period flavours (expected for Hopkins, Plummer and Meyers, interesting as regards Leto).\n\nThis is not the life ambition masterpiece Stone wanted to make, even if he proclaims on the extras that he's happy and content with The Final Cut version. This cut still shows some cracks, but these are not seismic enough to hurt the film. For there's a lot of grandeur, blood stirring and thought gone into the production, and there's a lot to be said for that in this day and age of soulless cash making filmic exercises.

I would take Guillmero Del Torro in the director's chair any time any place, but Hellboy II shows that he is not without his flaws. Ron Perlman who is terrific as Hellboy doesn't have anything truly interesting to say or do, the world around him is magical but the plot isn't.\n\nHellboy is the most unique character to appear in your comic book shop. The mythology and the character are such the opposite of the main stream and to Hellboy II's credit so is this movie. Ron Perlman doesn't deliver catch phrases or gun down bad guys for the sake of doing so. He is an interesting character but he is overshadowed by this lackluster plot and the world around it. I felt as if we didn't see enough of Big Red or maybe we did we just didn't get to see the most of the talents. Del Torro constantly wants to remind you that he directed Pan's Labyrinth because visually the creatures look like they were leftovers from that film. I don't mind this per say but these characters just don't have much to do, they are there really to look at rather than them having significance. Visually I can't complain about them because they are amazing but they serve little purpose to the story.\n\nThe plot is really the weakest thing this movie has going for it. I felt it took too many liberties against the original concepts of Hellboy. Hellboy is a creature alive in our world, Del Torro tries to tell us that our world is nothing more than a division of fantasy and reality. Well we spend too much time in the fantasy that we forget the fact that this Golden Army is a threat to reality. The villain Prince Nuada is weak, we don't see any method to his madness other than the fact that the plot dictates that he be the antagonist. In the first film and to a lesser degree this one we were given details about why Hellboy has faith in humanity and would chose not to serve his purpose. It's interesting because we are given glimpses of what could have been something that could have added real teeth and tension to the story, for the first time Hellboy is tempted by evil, weakly tempted but tempted nonetheless. This mental struggle could have given our actors the chance to show their talent but instead the filler between the action scenes is just okay at best.\n\nI didn't hate Hellboy II I just think it needed some beef in it's story. Del Torro has shown us he is a master storyteller but this time he didn't focus on the story it's self. I would recommend this film but I know Del Torro can and has done much better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262248,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-10-08","keywords":"superhero,twins,friendship,cat,elf","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. teaser trailer: Hellboy II: The Golden Army","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1588723993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg","description":"This is a teaser trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, directed by Guillermo del Toro"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004757/","name":"Selma Blair"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427964/","name":"Doug Jones"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020061/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239918/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586005/","name":"Mike Mignola"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This film shows Batman facing his most feared nemesis The Joker while as Bruce Wayne he attempts to lead as normal a life as possible. Now there was a lot of uproar to Michael Keaton as Batman before the film but after this film all doubts were forgotten. He is absolutely superb as both Bruce Wayne and Batman and really emphasised this new Gothic type serious character. Now the real strength of this film is Jack Nicholson's Joker, he is just perfect for this film and for this new Batman this Joker was the key counter for him and the performance was perfect and Nicholson was the perfect person to play The Joker. Kim Bassinger as Vicki Vale was decent but not fantastic and she was reasonable in her role, the character of Knox was decent too and neither took anything away from the film and added something to it. The story was alright with the transformation to the Joker but his motivations weren't really that believable and weren't an important part of the film. The script is really good and both Keaton and especially Nicholson have great lines that once again just fits this film magnificently. For 1989 the style is fantastic also the Danny Elfman score is legendary and the look of Gotham overall fits the Gothic film that this is which contrasts well with the prince songs. This is a fantastic film that still stands up now.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":351581,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1989-06-23","keywords":"bruce wayne character,batman character,dc comics,joker character,criminal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Batman","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi940246809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU1MWE4YzctZmEzNy00ZDE5LTg1NzMtZDcwN2IzNzM5OTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU1MWE4YzctZmEzNy00ZDE5LTg1NzMtZDcwN2IzNzM5OTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer with text and price on screen"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000474/","name":"Michael Keaton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000197/","name":"Jack Nicholson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000107/","name":"Kim Basinger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108873/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106129/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004170/","name":"Bob Kane"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358334/","name":"Sam Hamm"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0803730/","name":"Warren Skaaren"}],"duration":"PT2H6M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This film shows Batman facing his most feared nemesis The Joker while as Bruce Wayne he attempts to lead as normal a life as possible. Now there was a lot of uproar to Michael Keaton as Batman before the film but after this film all doubts were forgotten. He is absolutely superb as both Bruce Wayne and Batman and really emphasised this new Gothic type serious character. Now the real strength of this film is Jack Nicholson's Joker, he is just perfect for this film and for this new Batman this Joker was the key counter for him and the performance was perfect and Nicholson was the perfect person to play The Joker. Kim Bassinger as Vicki Vale was decent but not fantastic and she was reasonable in her role, the character of Knox was decent too and neither took anything away from the film and added something to it. The story was alright with the transformation to the Joker but his motivations weren't really that believable and weren't an important part of the film. The script is really good and both Keaton and especially Nicholson have great lines that once again just fits this film magnificently. For 1989 the style is fantastic also the Danny Elfman score is legendary and the look of Gotham overall fits the Gothic film that this is which contrasts well with the prince songs. This is a fantastic film that still stands up now.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":351581,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1989-06-23","keywords":"bruce wayne character,batman character,dc comics,joker character,criminal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Batman","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi940246809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU1MWE4YzctZmEzNy00ZDE5LTg1NzMtZDcwN2IzNzM5OTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjU1MWE4YzctZmEzNy00ZDE5LTg1NzMtZDcwN2IzNzM5OTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer with text and price on screen","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000474/","name":"Michael Keaton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000197/","name":"Jack Nicholson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000107/","name":"Kim Basinger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108873/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106129/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004170/","name":"Bob Kane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358334/","name":"Sam Hamm","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0803730/","name":"Warren Skaaren"],"duration":"PT2H6M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This helps the film because really this is not something that tries to have something for everyone so much as it is a film that knows the target audience and is determined to give them what they want. As a result, the story here is a simple affair of a criminal scarred by the Punisher, going out for revenge while the police are after both of them  it is not the most complex bit of writing you'll ever see but then, it doesn't need to be. Those looking for the Punisher's dark tone to be utilised to try and make this character into a possible "Batman" in regards having a dark psyche at the core of it will be disappointed because the film does no such thing. I was one of these people though and I was at least hoping that more would be made of the rage and loss inside Castle  but again, a few flashbacks aside, he generally just broods around the place full of vengeful justice.\n\nWhat carries the film then is a series of brutal action sequences and effects shots, all full of callous violence, macho posturing and gun play that rewrites all rules of the real world. At this point it does depend what you are looking for because there are a core of viewers will love the film for this as it delivers exploded head after collapsing face after dismembering and other really graphic acts. For me personally the overdose on excess is all too much and it does leave the film with this very unpleasant air that makes it harder to enjoy. If the violence was a little less graphic or frequently graphic then it would have been easier to actually "enjoy" the big action sequences for what they were, rather than the gore putting me off  although again for some this will be the cherry on the cake. To the casual viewer this excess does give the film an exploitative, careless edge, where all the characters are little more than things waiting to explode and it limits how much we care  not just about the goons but also the main characters.\n\nThis further detracts from the dark character of Castle as he becomes just a machine and not a man or even a shadow of a man  and no, staring off moodily into the distance every now and again is not the same thing. At the same time it also limits the more flamboyant and silly side of the film  the side that the hammy Jigsaw needed to play up. You can see it in the excess but also in the Patton reference and other silly things; all of these imply that it should be a little bit camp with the darkness (hence making it a bit more fun and accessible) but it doesn't do this and those that play to this side of it are left just looking silly in a bad way rather than a good way.\n\nSpecifically West suffers from this as his comic book villain is lost in the sea of gore. As a Wire fan I do feel a bit for West but his Italian impersonation at the start is awful and, once behind the make-up he can do little but be "a bad man" without much unique about him to make him notable for anything other than what he has done before. Stevenson is not "good" either but he matches the ambition of the film and makes for a big dark presence  which is all the material needs and this he does well. I quite liked Salmon in it because he is one of the few that feels natural  which is a bit of a condemnation on everyone else when you think about Salmon's range generally. Hutchinson matches West by overplaying but again the sense of comic book madness is taken away by the gore.\n\nPunisher War Zone is a basic genre film then. For target audience it will satisfy as it delivers simple characters with simple motivations, a straight-forward plot with lots of action and lots of gore  boxes ticked. However for many casual viewers it will be all too dark and unpleasant as the gore dominates and it makes everything seem a bit less "entertaining" and a lot more like work. The dark tone to the character and the hammy silliness of the villains are lost and the entire film appears to be about exploding heads  great if that is your thing but not so great if not.

Production quality is amazing. The story is complex and long but worth the payoff. The acting is great overall. The hero's are vulnerable in so many ways. For every ability they have they suffer from even worse flaws. This is an alternate universe that forks from historical events. Rorschach is my favorite anti hero of all time and the end for me is an emotional powerful climax thats always a gut punch. Soundtrack is spot on.

It's sandwiched between the fandom of the Burton and Nolan films while simultaneously blamed for leading to Batman and Robin. If you compare it to the darker and more gothic Burton films and are disappointed Keaton isn't still playing Batman, of course you're not gonna enjoy it. If you compare it to the more serious neo-realism of the Nolan films, again you're not gonna enjoy it. What is it you ask? Batman Forever essentially plays out like a live action cartoon and it does this very well. If you watch it through that lens instead of judging it for what it's not you'll find that Batman Forever actually has superior continuity and pacing than any other Batman film except maybe the 1966 version. This is coming from someone who's favorite film is Batman 1989 and a big Tim Burton fan. It honestly baffles me to hear people rave about how great Batman Returns is and then go on to bash Batman Forever. While Returns has a ton going for it, it really suffers from the same core problem as Batman and Robin; the director getting too cute with creative control. All Joel Schumacher did was set out to make a fun super-hero film with something for everyone to enjoy and I honestly think he succeeded with Forever. With Batman and Robin he went too flamboyant just like Burton went too zany and weird with Returns. The first time around both directors got it right testing the waters with their own respective styles. Everything in the film is very cartoonish and if you appreciate it from that perspective it's really quite masterful in a lot of subtle and not so subtle ways. Although Batman The Animated Series was largely influenced by the Burton movies Forever really seems like it's bringing that onto the big screen with real actors and real sets which is quite a feat. Schumacher just added more color and neon which honestly is a welcome change from the stark art deco gothic flavor present in Returns. Nothing wrong with that flavor in Returns, it's just that Burton went all in and we didn't necessarily need more of the same. Batman Returns actually has considerably different art direction from Batman 1989 yet you rarely hear fans complain about that difference or even acknowledge it.\n\nNicole Kidman is perfectly cast as Chase Meridian and I like Chris O'Donnell as Robin even though he was probably a tad old. Everyone criticizes Val Kilmer for being too bland compared to Keaton but honestly the latter wouldn't have worked at all in the film the way it was done. Since Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are both such strong personalities a more stoic Kilmer contrasts that well. Batman Forever really is Jim Carrey's vehicle though. You watch Batman Forever for Jim Carrey the same way you watch Batman 1989 for Jack Nicholson.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":241256,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1995-06-16","keywords":"bruce wayne character,batman character,alfred pennyworth character,harvey dent character,james gordon character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1146535449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTgwYzBkNDYtMjkzYy00MDk2LWFhN2MtN2M0NDQxNmQ5ZGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTgwYzBkNDYtMjkzYy00MDk2LWFhN2MtN2M0NDQxNmQ5ZGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Batman must battle former district attorney Harvey Dent, who is now Two-Face and Edward Nygma, The Riddler with help from an amorous psychologist and a young circus acrobat who becomes his sidekick, Robin."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000174/","name":"Val Kilmer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000120/","name":"Jim Carrey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001708/","name":"Joel Schumacher"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106129/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004170/","name":"Bob Kane"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0060761/","name":"Lee Batchler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0060760/","name":"Janet Scott Batchler"}],"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The visionary director manages, through the undaunted and determined flow of fans with the #releasethesnydercut movement, to bring his spectacular vision of the Justice League, presenting a spectacular film with parsimony and dedication, as only a true DC fan can do. Not only the film is deepened with a wealth of filmed material that no one ever imagined existed, but it manages to redeem itself and to fight with tight fists the previous Justice League (2017) which was a total and a colossal flop in every aspect (not Snyder's fault, of course). In this Snyder Cut all the questions that the Theatrical Cut did not give are answered, digging into the background of the characters and giving valid reasons where it seemed everything was thrown into turmoil and even randomly placed; moreover, the full potential of Snyder's direction is expressed through his unique and particular shots, also implementing and improving both CGI and cinematography, which are the perfect accompaniment to the director's vision. The four hours of the Snyder Cut are nothing more than a blaze of beauty towards these heroes, where with the old release seemed all too strange that they (production &amp; co.) had offered so little from such a talented and resourceful director. Recall that the Snyder Cut must be contextualized and must be interposed in a timeline that had precedents and sequels in the DC Extended Universe, but now it is all to be reviewed, all to be rewritten, all to be reset. This film, as well as citing a similar case (although not entirely), namely The Godfather III Coda, totally redeems the film, putting everything in a new light, entrancing both fans and insiders and in doing so recreating a films from 0 (in fact much of the Theatrical Cut material is not present), bringing to light aspects never seen before and better set together and doing so, finally, being meaningful. Commendable and mouth-watering movie to learn more and that opens up worlds as well as in DC comics. Bravo Zack Snyder, Bravo. Justice has been served for the Justice League.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":334983,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2021-03-18","keywords":"superhero,extended version,dc extended universe,badass,dc comics","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2343551001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc5Zjc2YTMtM2IwZC00OTAyLThjZTktNGU3MjVjNTY5YThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc5Zjc2YTMtM2IwZC00OTAyLThjZTktNGU3MjVjNTY5YThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Zack Snyder's Justice League, determined to ensure Superman’s (Henry Cavill) ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) aligns forces with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions.

The visionary director manages, through the undaunted and determined flow of fans with the #releasethesnydercut movement, to bring his spectacular vision of the Justice League, presenting a spectacular film with parsimony and dedication, as only a true DC fan can do. Not only the film is deepened with a wealth of filmed material that no one ever imagined existed, but it manages to redeem itself and to fight with tight fists the previous Justice League (2017) which was a total and a colossal flop in every aspect (not Snyder's fault, of course). In this Snyder Cut all the questions that the Theatrical Cut did not give are answered, digging into the background of the characters and giving valid reasons where it seemed everything was thrown into turmoil and even randomly placed; moreover, the full potential of Snyder's direction is expressed through his unique and particular shots, also implementing and improving both CGI and cinematography, which are the perfect accompaniment to the director's vision. The four hours of the Snyder Cut are nothing more than a blaze of beauty towards these heroes, where with the old release seemed all too strange that they (production &amp; co.) had offered so little from such a talented and resourceful director. Recall that the Snyder Cut must be contextualized and must be interposed in a timeline that had precedents and sequels in the DC Extended Universe, but now it is all to be reviewed, all to be rewritten, all to be reset. This film, as well as citing a similar case (although not entirely), namely The Godfather III Coda, totally redeems the film, putting everything in a new light, entrancing both fans and insiders and in doing so recreating a films from 0 (in fact much of the Theatrical Cut material is not present), bringing to light aspects never seen before and better set together and doing so, finally, being meaningful. Commendable and mouth-watering movie to learn more and that opens up worlds as well as in DC comics. Bravo Zack Snyder, Bravo. Justice has been served for the Justice League.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":334983,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2021-03-18","keywords":"superhero,extended version,dc extended universe,badass,dc comics","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2343551001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc5Zjc2YTMtM2IwZC00OTAyLThjZTktNGU3MjVjNTY5YThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc5Zjc2YTMtM2IwZC00OTAyLThjZTktNGU3MjVjNTY5YThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Zack Snyder's Justice League, determined to ensure Superman’s (Henry Cavill) ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) aligns forces with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions.

More sex, language, unreal car chases? Less plot and enough action sequences in one episode to give your brain an epileptic seizure? After getting hooked on fun, entertaining shows like The Good Cop and Battle Creek only to have them cancelled after one season, I give up trying to figure out today's viewers. No, LA's Finest isn't perfect (or totally realistic, but hey, what show is?). Yet it's pretty engaging. The story lines keep me coming back for more episodes and I think the acting is pretty good.

Martin Clunes and Dominic Minghella should (and I'm sure do) take intense pride over their creation. The writing is the best in the business, the director Ben Bolt is amazing, and the acting is subtle, natural, hilarious and touching. In addition to Martin Clunes, Caroline Catz has shown herself to be one of the best of her generation. And the scenery and music, of course, are beautiful.\n\nPleeeeeeaaaaaaaase, please, please Mr. and Mrs. Clunes: Don't sell out to us Yanks.

I find it puzzling that people will "nit-pic" a TV show that lasted a decent 4 years on the air, yes maybe corny to todays standards, but the show was harmless entertainment. Unlike TV programming today, at least it had it's own originality. Kids could watch it without a lot of heavy violence or nudity, (which was like none in Knight Rider. to name only a few.) on the contrary, it was very much sci-fi, as well as drama, and action.

I still think this is one of the coolest shows ever, and I freely admit that Knight Rider can be pretty idiotic at the same time. The series was basically a cartoon and that can make it hard for some people to revisit when they grow up. I think that Knight Rider is one of the best unintentionally hilarious shows ever created. The silly aspects of the series make it just that much more entertaining in adult life. Knight Rider is an endearing and nostalgic series that finds a way to entertain you despite how ridiculous it can all be. "Michael &amp; KITT", how can you not feel the tug of the old days back in the 80s when you hear that? We all grew up with this show back in the 1980's as kids, the appeal of a cool looking black sports car that could TALK was irresistible back then. Today I guess we look back at Knight Rider and wonder "wtf". It might make us recoil, and get pretty damn embarrassed with some of the out there stuff we used to think was so cool. \n\nThe immense flaws of logic and continuity that plagued Knight Rider were easily hidden to a casual child viewing the show back in 1982 (I was 5 years old), but they really stick out like a sore thumb when viewed through adult eyes. The same damn stock footage was used ad nauseum, the frames were sped up to make a car going 20 mph look like it was zipping along at 400 mph, blue filters were always used to make it look like it was night time; and as others have mentioned, the fight scenes were never, ever believable. I don't think they even had any kind of trained fight specialist on Knight Rider, it always seemed like the director just told Hasselhoff or the stunt doubles to simply go out there and just make up some crap that could pass for jujitsu or tae-kwon-do. But again, this is what makes Knight Rider so fun.\n\nThis series is loaded with all kinds of unintentional hilarity. Some of my favorites are when David Hasselhoff's stunt double wears a mustache in a take, or the episode when the stunt double's Michael Knight afro wig accidentally flew off while he was doing one of those patented "Hasselhoff-Fu" roundhouse karate kicks. It seemed like Michael Knight could take down any bad guy with one well placed karate kick to the head. Let's all be honest with ourselves, a big reason this show was popular was because it featured a really cool looking black car with that cool looking red scanner mounted in the front. Everyone loved that car, and there is no doubt that is the reason Knight Rider is a part of American pop cultural lore. I'm 26 1/2 years old today and I still like this show because it's my childhood, and because it's from the 80's that we all love and grew up in. Things would get so stupid, you often wondered if there would be a button on KITT's dashboard that would say "Drive Very Fast" instead of "Super Pursuit Mode". The show didn't magically become any more nerdier in the 2000's then it was in the 1980s. Even back in the early-mid 80s most people over the age of 15 had a tendency to laugh at Knight Rider. It was always cool to children that didn't pick apart the series, but not so to anyone above the 9th grade. The prime target audience was boys that were roughly 9 years of age. So if you were already over the age of 13 back in 1982 when Knight Rider first aired, then you were likely going to always be too cool for a show like this that leaned on being a live action cartoon. Yes it is amazing that this series lasted on NBC's prime time for 4 years.

I don't think they even had any kind of trained fight specialist on Knight Rider, it always seemed like the director just told Hasselhoff or the stunt doubles to simply go out there and just make up some crap that could pass for jujitsu or tae-kwon-do. But again, this is what makes Knight Rider so fun.\n\nThis series is loaded with all kinds of unintentional hilarity. Some of my favorites are when David Hasselhoff's stunt double wears a mustache in a take, or the episode when the stunt double's Michael Knight afro wig accidentally flew off while he was doing one of those patented "Hasselhoff-Fu" roundhouse karate kicks. It seemed like Michael Knight could take down any bad guy with one well placed karate kick to the head. Let's all be honest with ourselves, a big reason this show was popular was because it featured a really cool looking black car with that cool looking red scanner mounted in the front. Everyone loved that car, and there is no doubt that is the reason Knight Rider is a part of American pop cultural lore. I'm 26 1/2 years old today and I still like this show because it's my childhood, and because it's from the 80's that we all love and grew up in. Things would get so stupid, you often wondered if there would be a button on KITT's dashboard that would say "Drive Very Fast" instead of "Super Pursuit Mode". The show didn't magically become any more nerdier in the 2000's then it was in the 1980s. Even back in the early-mid 80s most people over the age of 15 had a tendency to laugh at Knight Rider. It was always cool to children that didn't pick apart the series, but not so to anyone above the 9th grade. The prime target audience was boys that were roughly 9 years of age. So if you were already over the age of 13 back in 1982 when Knight Rider first aired, then you were likely going to always be too cool for a show like this that leaned on being a live action cartoon. Yes it is amazing that this series lasted on NBC's prime time for 4 years. But aren't we glad it did?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31697,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1982-09-26","keywords":"vehicle driving by itself,private detective,crime fighter,pontiac trans am,1980s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001327/","name":"David Hasselhoff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0611811/","name":"Edward Mulhare","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000865/","name":"Richard Basehart"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088140/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488991/","name":"Glen A.

For every one intelligent, caring episode comes four or five exercises in downbeat, melodramatic soap opera which sap all the energy out of the show's still-present technical mastery. This four-disc set is a welcome flashback to the show's humble beginnings, when it wasn't supposed to be the most heart-pounding show on television, and succeeded on will, not on hype.\n\nThe central characters in the first season are Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), ER Residents Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) and pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney), Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), Surgical Resident Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq la Salle) and his protégé, third-year med student John Carter (Noah Wyle, the only actor to remain on the show through the entire run). They brought a fresh edge to the oft-repeated world of medical drama, helped greatly by the first television show, in my estimation, to ever put actual intelligence into the presentation. On ER, the cameras move, the people move, the consistent hustle and bustle of an actual environment is palpable, and not simply a setpiece. It's interesting to note that although the show was never broadcast in widescreen until 2001, in the middle of it's seventh season, these first episodes are all presented in the wider format. At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.\n\nStandout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.\n\nThe show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism. This is exaggerated a little, but still a valid point; rarely an episode goes by without something in the line of an unexpected pregnancy, a suicide attempt, a violent skirmish between doctor and patient, or (in one outrageous case) a 12-year old gang member brining his Glock into a trauma room to try and finish another 12-year old off.

Buy the 1st Season DVD","reviewBody":"ER in its present, 2003 form is a schizophrenic mess. For every one intelligent, caring episode comes four or five exercises in downbeat, melodramatic soap opera which sap all the energy out of the show's still-present technical mastery. This four-disc set is a welcome flashback to the show's humble beginnings, when it wasn't supposed to be the most heart-pounding show on television, and succeeded on will, not on hype.\n\nThe central characters in the first season are Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), ER Residents Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) and pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney), Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), Surgical Resident Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq la Salle) and his protégé, third-year med student John Carter (Noah Wyle, the only actor to remain on the show through the entire run). They brought a fresh edge to the oft-repeated world of medical drama, helped greatly by the first television show, in my estimation, to ever put actual intelligence into the presentation. On ER, the cameras move, the people move, the consistent hustle and bustle of an actual environment is palpable, and not simply a setpiece. It's interesting to note that although the show was never broadcast in widescreen until 2001, in the middle of it's seventh season, these first episodes are all presented in the wider format. At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.\n\nStandout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.\n\nThe show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism.

This four-disc set is a welcome flashback to the show's humble beginnings, when it wasn't supposed to be the most heart-pounding show on television, and succeeded on will, not on hype.\n\nThe central characters in the first season are Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), ER Residents Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) and pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney), Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), Surgical Resident Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq la Salle) and his protégé, third-year med student John Carter (Noah Wyle, the only actor to remain on the show through the entire run). They brought a fresh edge to the oft-repeated world of medical drama, helped greatly by the first television show, in my estimation, to ever put actual intelligence into the presentation. On ER, the cameras move, the people move, the consistent hustle and bustle of an actual environment is palpable, and not simply a setpiece. It's interesting to note that although the show was never broadcast in widescreen until 2001, in the middle of it's seventh season, these first episodes are all presented in the wider format. At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.\n\nStandout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.\n\nThe show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism.

They brought a fresh edge to the oft-repeated world of medical drama, helped greatly by the first television show, in my estimation, to ever put actual intelligence into the presentation.

It's interesting to note that although the show was never broadcast in widescreen until 2001, in the middle of it's seventh season, these first episodes are all presented in the wider format. At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.\n\nStandout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.\n\nThe show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism. This is exaggerated a little, but still a valid point; rarely an episode goes by without something in the line of an unexpected pregnancy, a suicide attempt, a violent skirmish between doctor and patient, or (in one outrageous case) a 12-year old gang member brining his Glock into a trauma room to try and finish another 12-year old off. Still, the show displayed remarkable resilience in almost always rising to become greater than the sum of its parts.

The storyline was simple enough: a group of people trying to make ends meet in a post-apocalyptic world in the aftermath of alien invasion. Simple! But oh my was I ever wrong.\n\nThe show will probably not change your viewing-habits but it will leave you with an deep impression of the great care the creators worked by. The characters are well-written and well-acted, they have emotions and soul, personality. They seem real. The story is paced moderately and the show rarely focuses on one element, like pure action or spacey Sci-Fi-phenomena, for long but manages to find the balance between these genres, making a show everybody should be able to sit through. And enjoy :-) The setting, mood and world is believable (as believable a post-apocalyptic world would be to me) and the atmosphere reaches a point of realism yet maintaining the fourth wall. The aliens are charming and sounds like the velociraptors from 'Jurassic Park' (actually a good thing), but they are more than meets the eye. We want to know more of them, yet the show keeps them at bay. They blend seamless into the world of chaos thanks to the before mentioned care by the creators. This is not one of those series that rely on cheap jokes, puns, mundane stereotypes, half-cooked morale and whathaveyou, but rather depicts a world not unlike your own: clever and natural.\n\nCheck it out :-) BTW, my first review ever on IMDb so be gentle with the rookie :-)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86958,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2011-06-19","keywords":"alien,military,father son relationship,alien invasion,supernatural power","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001864/","name":"Noah Wyle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2397366/","name":"Drew Roy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2684485/","name":"Maxim Knight"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003158/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088248/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305826/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Requiem","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi250064153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MTMyMjkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYxNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MTMyMjkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYxNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"See the first full trailer for the fourth season of TNT's "Falling Skies"."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I would juxtapose Line of Duty with e.g. Engrenages (France) and Ørnen: En krimi-odyssé (Denmark).\n\nI am looking forward to next seasons already.\n\nPS. 3, 4 and 5 are meaty as well, please proceed :) PS. 6 has somewhat less interesting outcome, but interesting twists and turns still visible.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-06-26","keywords":"conspiracy,police,internal affairs,police corruption,female police detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1161994/","name":"Martin Compston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0566049/","name":"Vicky McClure","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001160/","name":"Adrian Dunbar"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0231124/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072097/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0580519/","name":"Jed Mercurio"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Series 6 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1353236505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5MzNhN2ItYWMyNy00ZjQ2LWEzNjgtMDkzOWY3ZmNkMWM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTE5MzNhN2ItYWMyNy00ZjQ2LWEzNjgtMDkzOWY3ZmNkMWM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Lies cost lives.
