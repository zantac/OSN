The show now suffers without him. "Wheels up in 30," just doesn't sound the same coming from others. Don't get me wrong, I like the other characters, but Hotch was the glue. Egos need to let it go and do what is right not what you can do to throw the playground tantrum to get what you want. No respect for people with money using that as a means of getting their way...childish!!! Hotch started on this show and his character was the most interesting. He needs to be back on the show or I feel the show is going to reach a slow demise.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":177960,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

Shocking how bad this is. So disappointing!","reviewBody":"I expect a certain amount of political correctness from a Dick Wolf show. In Law &amp; Order, it was common for the initial suspect--a low level hood from the ghetto--to be innocent, with the ultimate criminal turning out to be a wealthy white executive/headmaster/philanthropist/politician/stereotypical elitist. By now, I expect any crime show on any network in the US and the UK to have ethnically diverse investigators reporting to a female commander. But as long as the plots make sense and the serious dialogue is leavened with humor, I can put up with all the calibrated political correctness. I've watched a lot of these shows over the years, notwithstanding their occasional triteness.\n\nThis show is PC on steroids. It's is the first show I've ever seen in which MS-13 members are victims. There is a point where the political messaging just gets so tiresome and tendentious that it results in ridiculous plots, terrible dialogue, and total inauthenticity.\n\nI hoped this show would be entertaining even if it wasn't exactly Masterpiece-just ordinary, decent TV. Instead. it is so stupid that it's unwatchable. How could a show with its pedigree go so wrong?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13074,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Basic formula is (1) A client has an issue; (2) Bull's team select a jury; (3a) Bull's team noisily express exactly what's happening inside every jury's head with 100% accuracy; (3b) Bull's team struggle and look like they're going to lose; (4) New and compelling evidence is miraculously discovered by Bull's team, frequently showing Police/FBI/etc to be incompetent investigators (although this is not directly addressed); (5) Bull's team wins case while Jason Bull commentates his lawyer's brilliance in whispers.\n\nIt's a very simplistic show, which might appeal if that's what you're after, but could also be really annoying. For example, time scales are completely fictional. Bull's team is always urgently gathering evidence during a trial. They frequently break laws, hack computer systems, and invade people's privacy. ALL of these actions are brushed off as inconsequential and a justified means to an end for their client. His team made up from former employees of the FBI and Homeland Security are idolised as if those organisations are faultless.\n\nEarlier episodes spent considerable time talking about juries, but there's no detail... just someone in a room staring at screens and expressing what are supposedly 100% accurate explanations of what each juror is thinking. Uncertainty is very rare.\n\nI'm not very familiar with trial science but it's hard to imagine that it hits this degree of formulaic perfection. Maybe a disinterest in looking at that is why what is meant to be the main premise of the show is brushed over so superficially. If a show had to be based on trial science, there would be so many interesting things it could focus on: accuracy, ethics, just getting it to work, the list goes on. Bull doesn't. It's just an excessively simplistic legal drama.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16658,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830388/","name":"Jaime Lee Kirchner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Shocking how bad this is. So disappointing!","reviewBody":"I expect a certain amount of political correctness from a Dick Wolf show.

I was never a lover of Ziva character but it worked within the team of characters... a balance I guess you could say...\n\nI have been watching since the new character to replace Ziva arrived and although as a character, Ellie really doesn't work for me.... the character itself isn't in line with the shows balance...\n\nI know some reviews mention her traits and methods within the show... that to be honest isn't the problem for me... its the way that character sits within the team and ultimately the show.... as we all know every character is unrealistic and more of a caricature.... so this new character and her traits aren't for me the issue...its the way that particular character just doesn't work within the team and balance of the show.... by deliberately avoiding going for a similar character as Ziva the makers have tried to go a different way and to me it ain't worked.... I have seen a few guest characters that would work better and create good relationships and open more story lines... this character ain't one of them...I find myself forwarding her scenes to avoid the irritation her character brings...I have only found myself being irritated by one other character during the shows seasons and that is the Coast Guard Agent Borin she was terrible...so OTT at trying to be something she clearly couldn't be .... like some sort of female Gibbs character... she was really irritating both as a character and as the actress trying to play that role ... maybe a different actress would have made that work but certainly not Diane Neal...\n\nI hope the makers of the show do change this new character..I can see myself drifting away from this show if they don't...\n\nBut then maybe the other side of the coin is that the show is not putting out the same level of episodes and story lines that it used to... and my dislike of that new character is more about the overall than just the that..?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130580,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-09-23","keywords":"goth girl,babe scientist,special agent,naval criminal investigative service,police procedural","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001319/","name":"Mark Harmon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564724/","name":"David McCallum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0615266/","name":"Sean Murray"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0114905/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066107/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069074/","name":"Donald P.

I was never a lover of Ziva character but it worked within the team of characters... a balance I guess you could say...\n\nI have been watching since the new character to replace Ziva arrived and although as a character, Ellie really doesn't work for me.... the character itself isn't in line with the shows balance...\n\nI know some reviews mention her traits and methods within the show... that to be honest isn't the problem for me... its the way that character sits within the team and ultimately the show.... as we all know every character is unrealistic and more of a caricature.... so this new character and her traits aren't for me the issue...its the way that particular character just doesn't work within the team and balance of the show.... by deliberately avoiding going for a similar character as Ziva the makers have tried to go a different way and to me it ain't worked.... I have seen a few guest characters that would work better and create good relationships and open more story lines... this character ain't one of them...I find myself forwarding her scenes to avoid the irritation her character brings...I have only found myself being irritated by one other character during the shows seasons and that is the Coast Guard Agent Borin she was terrible...so OTT at trying to be something she clearly couldn't be .... like some sort of female Gibbs character... she was really irritating both as a character and as the actress trying to play that role ... maybe a different actress would have made that work but certainly not Diane Neal...\n\nI hope the makers of the show do change this new character..I can see myself drifting away from this show if they don't...\n\nBut then maybe the other side of the coin is that the show is not putting out the same level of episodes and story lines that it used to... and my dislike of that new character is more about the overall than just the that..?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130580,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-09-23","keywords":"goth girl,babe scientist,special agent,naval criminal investigative service,police procedural","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001319/","name":"Mark Harmon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564724/","name":"David McCallum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0615266/","name":"Sean Murray"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0114905/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066107/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069074/","name":"Donald P.

Shocking how bad this is. So disappointing!","reviewBody":"I expect a certain amount of political correctness from a Dick Wolf show. In Law &amp; Order, it was common for the initial suspect--a low level hood from the ghetto--to be innocent, with the ultimate criminal turning out to be a wealthy white executive/headmaster/philanthropist/politician/stereotypical elitist. By now, I expect any crime show on any network in the US and the UK to have ethnically diverse investigators reporting to a female commander. But as long as the plots make sense and the serious dialogue is leavened with humor, I can put up with all the calibrated political correctness. I've watched a lot of these shows over the years, notwithstanding their occasional triteness.\n\nThis show is PC on steroids. It's is the first show I've ever seen in which MS-13 members are victims. There is a point where the political messaging just gets so tiresome and tendentious that it results in ridiculous plots, terrible dialogue, and total inauthenticity.\n\nI hoped this show would be entertaining even if it wasn't exactly Masterpiece-just ordinary, decent TV. Instead. it is so stupid that it's unwatchable. How could a show with its pedigree go so wrong?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13074,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Shocking how bad this is. So disappointing!","reviewBody":"I expect a certain amount of political correctness from a Dick Wolf show. In Law &amp; Order, it was common for the initial suspect--a low level hood from the ghetto--to be innocent, with the ultimate criminal turning out to be a wealthy white executive/headmaster/philanthropist/politician/stereotypical elitist. By now, I expect any crime show on any network in the US and the UK to have ethnically diverse investigators reporting to a female commander. But as long as the plots make sense and the serious dialogue is leavened with humor, I can put up with all the calibrated political correctness. I've watched a lot of these shows over the years, notwithstanding their occasional triteness.\n\nThis show is PC on steroids. It's is the first show I've ever seen in which MS-13 members are victims. There is a point where the political messaging just gets so tiresome and tendentious that it results in ridiculous plots, terrible dialogue, and total inauthenticity.\n\nI hoped this show would be entertaining even if it wasn't exactly Masterpiece-just ordinary, decent TV. Instead. it is so stupid that it's unwatchable. How could a show with its pedigree go so wrong?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13074,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was never a lover of Ziva character but it worked within the team of characters... a balance I guess you could say...\n\nI have been watching since the new character to replace Ziva arrived and although as a character, Ellie really doesn't work for me.... the character itself isn't in line with the shows balance...\n\nI know some reviews mention her traits and methods within the show... that to be honest isn't the problem for me... its the way that character sits within the team and ultimately the show.... as we all know every character is unrealistic and more of a caricature.... so this new character and her traits aren't for me the issue...its the way that particular character just doesn't work within the team and balance of the show.... by deliberately avoiding going for a similar character as Ziva the makers have tried to go a different way and to me it ain't worked....

Basic formula is (1) A client has an issue; (2) Bull's team select a jury; (3a) Bull's team noisily express exactly what's happening inside every jury's head with 100% accuracy; (3b) Bull's team struggle and look like they're going to lose; (4) New and compelling evidence is miraculously discovered by Bull's team, frequently showing Police/FBI/etc to be incompetent investigators (although this is not directly addressed); (5) Bull's team wins case while Jason Bull commentates his lawyer's brilliance in whispers.\n\nIt's a very simplistic show, which might appeal if that's what you're after, but could also be really annoying. For example, time scales are completely fictional. Bull's team is always urgently gathering evidence during a trial. They frequently break laws, hack computer systems, and invade people's privacy. ALL of these actions are brushed off as inconsequential and a justified means to an end for their client. His team made up from former employees of the FBI and Homeland Security are idolised as if those organisations are faultless.\n\nEarlier episodes spent considerable time talking about juries, but there's no detail... just someone in a room staring at screens and expressing what are supposedly 100% accurate explanations of what each juror is thinking. Uncertainty is very rare.\n\nI'm not very familiar with trial science but it's hard to imagine that it hits this degree of formulaic perfection. Maybe a disinterest in looking at that is why what is meant to be the main premise of the show is brushed over so superficially. If a show had to be based on trial science, there would be so many interesting things it could focus on: accuracy, ethics, just getting it to work, the list goes on. Bull doesn't. It's just an excessively simplistic legal drama.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16658,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1830388/","name":"Jaime Lee Kirchner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Shocking how bad this is. So disappointing!","reviewBody":"I expect a certain amount of political correctness from a Dick Wolf show. In Law &amp; Order, it was common for the initial suspect--a low level hood from the ghetto--to be innocent, with the ultimate criminal turning out to be a wealthy white executive/headmaster/philanthropist/politician/stereotypical elitist. By now, I expect any crime show on any network in the US and the UK to have ethnically diverse investigators reporting to a female commander. But as long as the plots make sense and the serious dialogue is leavened with humor, I can put up with all the calibrated political correctness. I've watched a lot of these shows over the years, notwithstanding their occasional triteness.\n\nThis show is PC on steroids. It's is the first show I've ever seen in which MS-13 members are victims. There is a point where the political messaging just gets so tiresome and tendentious that it results in ridiculous plots, terrible dialogue, and total inauthenticity.\n\nI hoped this show would be entertaining even if it wasn't exactly Masterpiece-just ordinary, decent TV.

And he does it using different tones and genres and supported by extraordinary performances.\n\nReview:\n\nMaxime goes to a country house to spend a few days with his cousin Francois and Daphné, his partner. But Francois had to leave before his arrival and Maxime and Daphné will spend a few days alone chatting and revealing their respective sentimental stories.\n\nEmmanuel Mouret (director and guinosta) achieves an admirable mosaic of intertwined stories. In the first place, there are two main stories, with their respective points of view: Daphné's and Maxime's, each developed with a different tone, with some voice-over introducing or commenting on the flashbacks that alternate. On the other hand, there is the present time, where the point of view is that of the spectator. Then other moments with other points of view will be added.\n\nThe inventory of situations is overwhelming, exposed without haste and without pause, with flirtations, friendships, courtships, couples, marriages and infidelities, always highlighting the difference between "what is said and what is done", to what I I would add "what it feels like."\n\nAnd yes: it is a French film with a literary imprint where the characters talk a lot about what happens to them, but where they are also silent as much. The style of the story refers to various cinematographies, depending on which story and characters it is and at what point in the story we find ourselves: at times it seems like a Rohmer film and at others a very subtle humor close to Woody Allen appears, for example. Different tones of comedy (tangled, romantic, sentimental), melodrama and drama are combined, with extraordinary use of a soundtrack with classical music ranging from Purcell and Haydn to Poulenc. In this way, the sequence of scenes could also be assimilated to a series of recitatives and arias from a Mozart opera. But beyond the references and influences, the result is absolutely personal.\n\nFar from causing dispersion, the script solidly interweaves the stories, sheds new light in their recesses and the dramatic crescendo is incessant, reaching an extremely emotional climax.\n\nWithin a solid cast, Niels Schneider stands out as Maxime, a timid aspiring writer (in the antipodes of the manipulative Philippe who played in An Impossible Love or the Object of Desire in Dolan's Imaginary Loves), Camélia Jordana who brings all her expressiveness to Daphné, a film editor, Vincent Macaigne as the endearing Francois, Daphne's partner and Émilie Dequenne's Louise, with all her surprising edges.\n\nIn sum, over the course of two hours, Mouret unfolds this remarkable human comedy in the Balzacian sense, with the motives of his characters centered on desire and love and the delicate balance between what they say to each other, what they do, what they feel, what (to us and is) shown and hidden, seduction games, tacit or explicit agreements, renunciations, confusion, the imponderable.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1582,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-09-16","keywords":"paris france,cannes 2020,pregnant woman,countryside,flashback","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [VOST]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1976156441","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTczNTJiNTctOWJjYi00NDcxLTlkMmUtNGVjOTQ1ZDgzZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTczNTJiNTctOWJjYi00NDcxLTlkMmUtNGVjOTQ1ZDgzZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3874127/","name":"Camélia Jordana"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2671105/","name":"Niels Schneider"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531195/","name":"Vincent Macaigne"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609981/","name":"Emmanuel Mouret"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346444/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609981/","name":"Emmanuel Mouret"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And he does it using different tones and genres and supported by extraordinary performances.\n\nReview:\n\nMaxime goes to a country house to spend a few days with his cousin Francois and Daphné, his partner. But Francois had to leave before his arrival and Maxime and Daphné will spend a few days alone chatting and revealing their respective sentimental stories.\n\nEmmanuel Mouret (director and guinosta) achieves an admirable mosaic of intertwined stories. In the first place, there are two main stories, with their respective points of view: Daphné's and Maxime's, each developed with a different tone, with some voice-over introducing or commenting on the flashbacks that alternate. On the other hand, there is the present time, where the point of view is that of the spectator. Then other moments with other points of view will be added.\n\nThe inventory of situations is overwhelming, exposed without haste and without pause, with flirtations, friendships, courtships, couples, marriages and infidelities, always highlighting the difference between "what is said and what is done", to what I I would add "what it feels like."\n\nAnd yes: it is a French film with a literary imprint where the characters talk a lot about what happens to them, but where they are also silent as much. The style of the story refers to various cinematographies, depending on which story and characters it is and at what point in the story we find ourselves: at times it seems like a Rohmer film and at others a very subtle humor close to Woody Allen appears, for example. Different tones of comedy (tangled, romantic, sentimental), melodrama and drama are combined, with extraordinary use of a soundtrack with classical music ranging from Purcell and Haydn to Poulenc. In this way, the sequence of scenes could also be assimilated to a series of recitatives and arias from a Mozart opera. But beyond the references and influences, the result is absolutely personal.\n\nFar from causing dispersion, the script solidly interweaves the stories, sheds new light in their recesses and the dramatic crescendo is incessant, reaching an extremely emotional climax.\n\nWithin a solid cast, Niels Schneider stands out as Maxime, a timid aspiring writer (in the antipodes of the manipulative Philippe who played in An Impossible Love or the Object of Desire in Dolan's Imaginary Loves), Camélia Jordana who brings all her expressiveness to Daphné, a film editor, Vincent Macaigne as the endearing Francois, Daphne's partner and Émilie Dequenne's Louise, with all her surprising edges.\n\nIn sum, over the course of two hours, Mouret unfolds this remarkable human comedy in the Balzacian sense, with the motives of his characters centered on desire and love and the delicate balance between what they say to each other, what they do, what they feel, what (to us and is) shown and hidden, seduction games, tacit or explicit agreements, renunciations, confusion, the imponderable.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1582,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-09-16","keywords":"paris france,cannes 2020,pregnant woman,countryside,flashback","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [VOST]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1976156441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTczNTJiNTctOWJjYi00NDcxLTlkMmUtNGVjOTQ1ZDgzZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTczNTJiNTctOWJjYi00NDcxLTlkMmUtNGVjOTQ1ZDgzZTg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3874127/","name":"Camélia Jordana","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2671105/","name":"Niels Schneider","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531195/","name":"Vincent Macaigne"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609981/","name":"Emmanuel Mouret"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609981/","name":"Emmanuel Mouret"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="fr">En 1992, à Bujumbura, au Burundi, Gaby et ses amis s'introduisent discrètement dans les jardins de riches propriétaires occidentaux pour récolter des fruits, qu'ils revendent aussitôt à la sauvette aux automobilistes. Mais pour le jeune garçon, ce n'est qu'un jeu. Gaby vit en effet de façon aisée entre sa petite soeur, sa mère rwandaise, Yvonne, et son père Michel Chapaz, un entrepreneur français. Mais cette existence relativement paisible se fissure quand leurs parents se séparent et que des conflits entre Tutsis et Hutus commencent à éclater.</desc>

Goddard shows nearly no special effects and has made his movie in Paris in the sixties, which is a good trick (except that it is cheap!), because it says that this system is not far away from our reality.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24242,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1965-05-05","keywords":"dystopia,french new wave,surrealism,neo noir,absurdism","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Re-release Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3048975129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4ODI4OTU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg3NTk5MDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4ODI4OTU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg3NTk5MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A U.S. secret agent is sent to the distant space city of Alphaville where he must find a missing person and free the city from its tyrannical ruler.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176061/","name":"Eddie Constantine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0439344/","name":"Anna Karina","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848667/","name":"Akim Tamiroff"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000419/","name":"Jean-Luc Godard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0652887/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007019/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007978/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000419/","name":"Jean-Luc Godard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0959908/","name":"Paul Éluard"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The director, who wrote and produced this picture, was in great form in this story that is more like a fable, deliciously acted by Toto and Ninetto Davoli, one of the best pairings in Pasolini's movies.\n\nThe film is, in many aspects, a road movie. From the beginning, we watch as Toto and Ninetto take to the road in their trip to nowhere, it seems, but a trip which permits Pasolini examine some of the things that obsessed him, mainly his dislike for organized religion, as he perceived it in his country, as it clashed with reality. He takes the life of Saint Francis and the story about his relationship with the birds as the main topic for the movie.\n\nIt's hard to add anything else to what already has been said by the valuable contributions to IMDb. This film is one of the most inspired by the director. In it, he doesn't pound on the viewer's head those things that were dear to him. In fact, the film has a whimsical touch as we follow the two travelers, Toto and Ninetto, through rural Italy as a raven keeps telling them stories.\n\nToto is perfect as the older man who is living in his own world and doesn't see the changes around him. Ninetto Davoli gives a great performance as the happy go lucky son. Their surname, is Innocenti, or Innocent, which in a way, fits their characters rather well.\n\nThe black and white cinematography by Mario Bernardo and Tonino Delli Colli works wonders for the film. Ennio Morricone's musical score also enhances all that one sees on the screen.

    <desc lang="fr">Les galettes de Pont-Aven: Directed by Joël Séria. With Jean-Pierre Marielle, Dolores McDonough, Jeanne Goupil, Claude Piéplu. Henri is a middle-aged travelling umbrella salesman from Saumur who lives a sexless and unhappy married life with his puritan wife and two children. Painting is the only true passion of Henri but he also has an affection for female buttocks. One night, on the roads of Brittany he hits a boar with his car. Émile, a rude and carefree painter who lives in a cottage near Riec-sur-Belon meets him and invites him to stay at his house while the car is being fixed. Henri falls in love with his Canadian live-in girlfriend Angela who draws Henri's attention with her beautiful buttocks. They leave Émile after a violent confrontation and move to Pont-Aven, 'the city of painters'. Angela encourages Henri to continue his life as a painter and he sees this as an opportunity to leave his earlier life behind. However, Angela soon dumps him for Émile and Henri becomes a drunkard, butt of jokes in the town, and a painter unable to sell a single painting. Marie, the teenage maid working at the pension Henri stays, is apparently in love with him but he seems to neglect her because his mind is too occupied with Angela. However, Henri soon faces his true feelings for Marie. He finds pure love and a pair of beautiful buttocks in her and decides to make a new start in his life." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0187044/","name":"Les galettes de Pont-Aven","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWJlYmFkNWQtZGIwYy00NjFhLTllZmItNGQ1M2YzOTc1M2YyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQzMzQzODY@._V1_.jpg","description":"Henri is a middle-aged travelling umbrella salesman from Saumur who lives a sexless and unhappy married life with his puritan wife and two children.

A little masterpiece written for the screen by Francis Weber.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":233,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1979-04-18","keywords":"based on novel","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320760/","name":"Annie Girardot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0547339/","name":"Jean-Pierre Marielle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549650/","name":"Christian Marquand"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0596850/","name":"Édouard Molinaro"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068106/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0548935/","name":"Peter Marks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Le Trou has such an amazing kinetic rhythm to it that one both feels and forgets the claustrophobic environs. Based on a real story turned into a novel by one of the "escapees", the film has excellent casting, wonderful (candel-lit!) cinematography and crisp dialog among its other advantages.\n\nThe director was terminally ill during the shoot and was to die after making the final cut.

    <title lang="fr">Tod Browning, le jeu des illusions</title>
    <desc lang="fr">Uniquement connu en France pour son "Dracula", Tod Browning est un cinéaste oublié quand, dans les années 1960, quelques cinéphiles redécouvrent sa filmographie. Sa mort n'a, à l'époque, provoqué aucune réaction, ni aucun hommage de la part du milieu du cinéma hollywoodien. Cette injustice est désormais réparée puisque Tod Browning est aujourd'hui reconnu comme un virtuose de l'étrange. Ce documentaire revient sur sa carrière au cirque, ses débuts au cinéma sous l'égide de Griffith. D'abord acteur, puis scénariste et enfin réalisateur, Tod Browning a signé de très nombreux films muets. Il laisse une filmographie aux thèmes souvent effrayants, qui joue sur les faux-semblants, les illusions et la manipulation, une oeuvre qui ne craint ni la violence des sentiments, ni celle des actes.</desc>

    <desc lang="fr">Sa longue frange, son accent British et son couple avec Serge Gainsbourg dans les années 1970 ont marqué les imaginaires. À la fois actrice et mère, muse et militante, chanteuse et sex-symbol, Jane Birkin a traversé les époques depuis cinquante ans avec un panache qui l’a érigée au rang d’icône. De scènes de vie en sessions d’enregistrements, d’extraits de films en interviews, où l’actrice et chanteuse révèle son espièglerie, la réalisatrice Clélia Cohen éclaire les multiples visages d'une femme intemporelle.</desc>

Sure it's not realistic when it comes to peoples communications and reactions to certain incidents but thats the charm of it. It even has a little twist of drama but not enough to ruin the comedy. \n\nIt was amazing to me how the soundtrack just managed to get better and better, endless amount of rock/pop singles, thoughts like "aaaa i love that song" and " ohh man i had forgotten that one" often occurred to me. \n\nI thought the characters and the actors were great although some of the characters we're a bit useless i liked them after i was about 20 min into the film. \n\nI think we could use some pirate rock stations where i live, stations that will play and say what ever they please.\n\nFinal words.

Watched it, loved it. \n\nIt's a simple, "feel good" movie with the greatest music of the 60's and 70's that will make you smile. Sure it's not realistic when it comes to peoples communications and reactions to certain incidents but thats the charm of it. It even has a little twist of drama but not enough to ruin the comedy. \n\nIt was amazing to me how the soundtrack just managed to get better and better, endless amount of rock/pop singles, thoughts like "aaaa i love that song" and " ohh man i had forgotten that one" often occurred to me. \n\nI thought the characters and the actors were great although some of the characters we're a bit useless i liked them after i was about 20 min into the film. \n\nI think we could use some pirate rock stations where i live, stations that will play and say what ever they please.\n\nFinal words. A movie witch is fun to watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":109344,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2009-04-01","keywords":"pirate radio station,pop music,pirate radio,1960s,pirate broadcasting","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pirate Radio","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1266090521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2ODk3MTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM5NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU2ODk3MTE4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjM5NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A comedy about an illegal radio station in the North Sea in the 1960s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000450/","name":"Philip Seymour Hoffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0631490/","name":"Bill Nighy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296545/","name":"Nick Frost"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"],"duration":"PT2H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="fr">L'acteur et réalisateur Chad Chenouga réunit Bertrand Blier, Patrice Leconte et Bertrand Tavernier autour de leur passion du cinéma. Ces trois grands cinéastes populaires, à la filmographie impressionnante, ont commencé à réaliser des films dans les années 1960, mais c'est à partir du milieu des années 1970 que leurs carrières ont véritablement décollé. Au moment où Blier réalisait "Les Valseuses", en 1974, Tavernier tournait "L'horloger de Saint-Paul" tandis que, peu de temps après, Leconte mettait en scène "Les Bronzés". Ce documentaire tient le pari de les faire échanger sans langue de bois sur leurs carrières respectives ainsi que sur le cinéma français d'aujourd'hui.</desc>

But I kept grabbing my I-pad to something more interesting and/or exciting. The story and developments could have been done in 30 minutes. But alas, they did it in 90 minutes, leading to too little pace, too little jokes and scenes that do not matter. On the other hand, if you feel like a couch potato, like I did while watching, than it flows nicely, not expecting anything from you as a spectator. But if you do not see this one, you did not miss anything important.\n\nSo for you who are still interested the storyline: Jean-Jacques is a highly creative chef, but his imaginative duck rolls are not at all appreciated by his boss. The time has come for him to leave his secure job behind and open his own restaurant... Claude is a instructor for corporate entrepreneurs, but he would prefer to be a writer. It's time for him to give it all up and finally write his novel... Together, the two men could offer each other support in times of need, no longer be under stress and make their dreams come true...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-01-01","keywords":"male objectification,male full frontal nudity,hairy chest,pubic hair,male pubic hair","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180404/","name":"Clovis Cornillac"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687914/","name":"Denis Podalydès"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0480831/","name":"Axelle Laffont"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893107/","name":"Eric Veniard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028908/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070074/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893107/","name":"Eric Veniard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452723/","name":"Husky Kihal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065892/","name":"Julie Lopes-Curval"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But I kept grabbing my I-pad to something more interesting and/or exciting. The story and developments could have been done in 30 minutes. But alas, they did it in 90 minutes, leading to too little pace, too little jokes and scenes that do not matter. On the other hand, if you feel like a couch potato, like I did while watching, than it flows nicely, not expecting anything from you as a spectator. But if you do not see this one, you did not miss anything important.\n\nSo for you who are still interested the storyline: Jean-Jacques is a highly creative chef, but his imaginative duck rolls are not at all appreciated by his boss. The time has come for him to leave his secure job behind and open his own restaurant... Claude is a instructor for corporate entrepreneurs, but he would prefer to be a writer. It's time for him to give it all up and finally write his novel... Together, the two men could offer each other support in times of need, no longer be under stress and make their dreams come true...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-01-01","keywords":"male objectification,male full frontal nudity,hairy chest,pubic hair,male pubic hair","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180404/","name":"Clovis Cornillac","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687914/","name":"Denis Podalydès","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0480831/","name":"Axelle Laffont"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893107/","name":"Eric Veniard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028908/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070074/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893107/","name":"Eric Veniard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452723/","name":"Husky Kihal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065892/","name":"Julie Lopes-Curval"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If it isn't "Elizabeth: The Golden Age" (awful) or the television series, "The Tudors" (soft-pornographic trash), then it is "The Other Boleyn Girl", the latest film written by the Oscar nominated screenwriter, Peter Morgan. After his work on the Golden Globe winning TV film "Longford" and the Oscar winning (for its lead actors) "The Queen" and "The Last King of Scotland", his scripts must be in demand by actors across the globe. Little wonder then that this film attracts a stellar cast, including Eric Bana, Scarlett Johansson and Natalie Portman. So, why is it that this film, which is filled with great talent and potential, delivers only satisfaction? This was originally slated for release late last year, right in the middle of the awards season. Yet, for some reason, it was moved back. Why this was done is not widely known, but, as the IMDb had the film listed as completed last autumn, I should think that the decision was taken that this film would draw more attention outside of the congested awards season. Watching the film, you are aware of the ambition and lavish costumes that would draw the gaze of Oscar. But the film lacks punch, depth and the power to grip you the whole way through.\n\nThat's not to say that it isn't entertaining. Far from it, the film is, for an hour and a quarter, perfectly pleasant, with intrigue, scheming and romance aplenty. A lot of the credit must go to the performances, which range from accomplished to fantastically enjoyable to watch. Natalie Portman is impressive as Anne Boleyn. She ranges from scheming and nasty to genuinely sympathetic. It is her most notable work to date. Scarlett Johansson is fine, but everybody is still waiting for her to realise the potential she showed when she announced herself on the scene in "Lost in Translation" and "The Girl with the Pearl Earring". The supporting cast are a joy to watch. Eric Bana is excellent as Henry VIII, but it is the schemers in the background who provide the best entertainment. David Morrissey is having a lot of fun, whilst Mark Rylance and Kristin Scott Thomas are great as the Boleyn parents.\n\nIt is a perfectly bearable watch, but unfulfilling. There's an awful lot crammed into the hour and fifty minutes. As year after year of history is skipped through, the film's focus continually shifts, failing to allow certain characters from gaining appropriate intensity. Henry VIII is not as proactive as he might, or should, be. He is more driven then driving, whilst his first wife, Catherine of Aragon (Ana Torrent), is given very little time on screen, thus sidelining a character which should be a figure of great interest. But your expectations are dashed mainly because the film reaches its climax with half-an-hour to go, with an emotional pinnacle being reached and never again surpassed. A rape scene, which seems to be the start of the culmination, with so many points of interest going on in it, proves to be the end of it. The last thirty minutes, whilst quite stylish, are drawn out and slow, and end with a final scene that can only be described as cheesy.\n\nIt's a shame that this film is nothing more than admirable in places. But it is a good film for this time of year (that springtime lull between the quality of Winter and the bombast entertainment of Summer). It is an entertaining and satisfying way to pass an afternoon, but it won't live long in the memory.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":108587,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2008-06-04","keywords":"court,nightgown,death,sister sister relationship,rape","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Other Boleyn Girl","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1404174617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3NDY1MjEzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM4NjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3NDY1MjEzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTM4NjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Other Boleyn Girl Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000204/","name":"Natalie Portman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424060/","name":"Scarlett Johansson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0051509/","name":"Eric Bana"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149491/","name":"Justin Chadwick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0604948/","name":"Peter Morgan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339925/","name":"Philippa Gregory"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What it is is a movie to experience if you find yourself ever entertaining thoughts about loyalty, determination, talent, no talent, age, youth, courage, fear, fate, and the pain and joy of both living and dying.\n\nI read reviews of Million Dollar Baby and expected to like it. Roger Ebert can be soft on movies because he is plainly a big fan, but even he does not lightly toss around the M-word, masterpiece. Yet he drops it on MDB, and justly so. The story is simple and searing. A gal (Hilary Swank) with much heart and no experience aspires to be the champion of the world. She is Rocky in a sports bra. A grizzled fight trainer-manager/gym owner (Clint Eastwood) reluctantly takes her on. His best pal and wise-man assistant (Morgan Freemna) stands alongside them, as the plot unwinds steadily, seamlessly, picking up speed, scene by scene, act after act. Eastwood and Freeman are artists at the top of their profession and they, along with the brilliant Swank, present you the very worthy lives of three people you will care about and remember.

What it is is a movie to experience if you find yourself ever entertaining thoughts about loyalty, determination, talent, no talent, age, youth, courage, fear, fate, and the pain and joy of both living and dying.\n\nI read reviews of Million Dollar Baby and expected to like it. Roger Ebert can be soft on movies because he is plainly a big fan, but even he does not lightly toss around the M-word, masterpiece. Yet he drops it on MDB, and justly so. The story is simple and searing. A gal (Hilary Swank) with much heart and no experience aspires to be the champion of the world. She is Rocky in a sports bra. A grizzled fight trainer-manager/gym owner (Clint Eastwood) reluctantly takes her on. His best pal and wise-man assistant (Morgan Freemna) stands alongside them, as the plot unwinds steadily, seamlessly, picking up speed, scene by scene, act after act. Eastwood and Freeman are artists at the top of their profession and they, along with the brilliant Swank, present you the very worthy lives of three people you will care about and remember. The arena is boxing, but it might as well have been boating or baking. It is a story about values and truths that far exceed sports and movies. I walked into the Lowes Lincoln Square theater last night knowing Million Dollar Baby was taking me on a ride and willing to hop aboard.

Tautouology is concerned, on the contrary, with necessary repetitions, that is, with the annual recurrence of a species of elfin creature with large eyes, which once a year appears in films. Tautouology is the most recently created of scientific disciplines, and is thus an indicator of the relentless march of progress in science and technology. Tautous are very rare, and only one specimen is so far known to science. Although it is suspected that there may be a colony of Tautous somewhere, perhaps in France, this has never been proved. The private habits of the Tautou are entirely unknown, and it has never been observed in its burrow. Many theories have been formed about the Tautou, but they are all highly speculative. Certainly, the Tautou has been observed frequently in Paris, and it is thought that this rare creature may have some connection with the Paris catacombs, to which it may possibly retire at night (though this has never been reliably reported by a qualified observer). This film, 'God Is Great but I Am Tiny', preserves valuable evidence on film of the behaviour of the Tautou. This film was made immediately after 'Amelie', when the Tautou is estimated by science to have been 24 years of age. (Tautous are believed to live to a great age, perhaps even 100.) The Tautou is a neotonous creature, that is, it looks much younger than it is, and it preserves childlike characteristics into adulthood. In fact, it is believed by some that these infantilisms will never disappear, or at least many scientists hope not, and that the Tautou will still be a little girl when it reaches the age of 100 which is predicted for it. In this film, a fine contribution is made by Edouard Baer, who delivers an excellent performance as a human, as do Julie Depardieu, Anna Koch, Atmen Kelif, and other humans who surround and interact with the Tautou in this excellent natural history film. The direction of the film by Pascale Bailly is lively, if somewhat over-quirky at times, adopting very much a cinema verite approach (the references to Godard in the film did not go unnoticed by scientists). The theological implications of this study of the religious behaviour of the Tautou, as it wavers in the film from religion to religion (Catholicism, Buddhism, Judaism, you name it), is thought to be a comment upon Heidegger's views of 'being and essence'. Certainly the Tautou says at one point to Francois: 'You aren't Jewish enough.' The social interactions of the Tautou with the humans make this film fascinating to watch, as the Tautou shows extreme volatility, which the humans have trouble coping with. The Tautou is liable to change religions in the same way that the Arctic hare goes from brown to white when the snow falls. Tautou mood swings, emotional seizures, changes of hair style, clothing changes, alterations between loving and hating, all confirm the zoological conclusions arrived at on the basis of other evidence, that the Tautou has a hyper-sensitivity to its social environment and reacts badly to the withdrawal of love. This film is of extreme importance to the discipline of Tautouology, and is recommended to all serious students of this rare mammal.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2442,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-09-26","keywords":"anti semitism,jewish,veterinarian,judaism,reference to the old testament","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046347/","name":"Edouard Baer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0220017/","name":"Julie Depardieu"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0047645/","name":"Pascale Bailly"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032072/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0850942/","name":"Alain Tasma"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0047645/","name":"Pascale Bailly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738925/","name":"Marcia Romano"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Sure you do. Jeff Goldblum explained it in Jurassic Park: "A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking, and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine." As one might guess from the title itself, Happenstance is all about randomness and chance. It details how the tiniest of events can lead to a particular outcome--in this case, the uniting of two soulmates.\n\nHappenstance adheres strictly to its philosophy, perhaps to a fault. The film skips from person to person in what is quite a large ensemble cast, itemizing how each of them contributes to the system. Due to the intricacies of details involved, in order to bring the audience to the "main" characters' resolution, it fails to follow up on supporting players, many of whom shared as much screen time as the leads. As a result, audiences might be left with more questions than what answers the ending provides. This might be solved by extending the length of the film to follow the other characters, but Happenstance borders on sluggishness at 90 minutes.\n\n Still, because of the film's constant reverence to its notions of chance and fate, it leaves us with a sense of faith that "happenstance" will come to everyone in their own turn.\n\nWith such a large cast, it's surprising that there seem to be no weak links among them.\n\nWe get to see a different side of Audrey Tautou's spectrum than the naive, wide-eyed dreamer we're familiar with... Here, she's a bit cynical, certainly a realist, and at times, rather self-centered. Her eyes and head hang a little low, and the pixie we watched in Amélie practically disappears. As with He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, this film is not a great challenge to her acting abilities, but she provides a simple role with solid performance.\n\nThe same can be said with all the cast, though it's a bit challenging to match actors' names with the characters' faces. They each play his or her role evenly, with a unique and distinguishable set of strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSuch characterization was obviously well thought out by Laurent Firode, who wrote and directed Happenstance. He does a magnificent job at characterization, and one wonders how great he might do with a film focused on two or three main characters. His visual style, while not overpowering, also contributes greatly to the presentation of detail in the film.\n\nDon't rent this expecting Audrey Tautou in every scene, but if you wish to sample some more of her acting, or if you're just interested in an intelligent foreign film, Happenstance should leave you happy."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3878,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2000-06-21","keywords":"luck,astrology,astrology enthusiast,astrology believer,zodiac sign","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0269002/","name":"Faudel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767710/","name":"Eric Savin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0278705/","name":"Laurent Firode"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021808/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048057/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0278705/","name":"Laurent Firode"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

How, thanks to what's known as the "Butterfly theory" (a random series of unlinked events), can a young woman and a young man meet ?" data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0243135/","name":"Le battement d'ailes du papillon","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTVhYjk1YjAtOTQ0Zi00YjljLWIwOTQtNzIzYjhiYjRlMTlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNDI4ODM5MDM@._V1_.jpg","description":"How, thanks to what's known as the "Butterfly theory" (a random series of unlinked events), can a young woman and a young man meet ?","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0243135/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"C2FThom","dateCreated":"2003-09-14","inLanguage":"English","name":"The Butterfly Effect","reviewBody":"Do you know about the Butterfly Effect? Sure you do. Jeff Goldblum explained it in Jurassic Park: "A butterfly can flap its wings in Peking, and in Central Park you get rain instead of sunshine." As one might guess from the title itself, Happenstance is all about randomness and chance. It details how the tiniest of events can lead to a particular outcome--in this case, the uniting of two soulmates.\n\nHappenstance adheres strictly to its philosophy, perhaps to a fault. The film skips from person to person in what is quite a large ensemble cast, itemizing how each of them contributes to the system. Due to the intricacies of details involved, in order to bring the audience to the "main" characters' resolution, it fails to follow up on supporting players, many of whom shared as much screen time as the leads. As a result, audiences might be left with more questions than what answers the ending provides. This might be solved by extending the length of the film to follow the other characters, but Happenstance borders on sluggishness at 90 minutes.\n\n Still, because of the film's constant reverence to its notions of chance and fate, it leaves us with a sense of faith that "happenstance" will come to everyone in their own turn.\n\nWith such a large cast, it's surprising that there seem to be no weak links among them.\n\nWe get to see a different side of Audrey Tautou's spectrum than the naive, wide-eyed dreamer we're familiar with... Here, she's a bit cynical, certainly a realist, and at times, rather self-centered. Her eyes and head hang a little low, and the pixie we watched in Amélie practically disappears. As with He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not, this film is not a great challenge to her acting abilities, but she provides a simple role with solid performance.\n\nThe same can be said with all the cast, though it's a bit challenging to match actors' names with the characters' faces. They each play his or her role evenly, with a unique and distinguishable set of strengths and weaknesses.\n\nSuch characterization was obviously well thought out by Laurent Firode, who wrote and directed Happenstance. He does a magnificent job at characterization, and one wonders how great he might do with a film focused on two or three main characters. His visual style, while not overpowering, also contributes greatly to the presentation of detail in the film.\n\nDon't rent this expecting Audrey Tautou in every scene, but if you wish to sample some more of her acting, or if you're just interested in an intelligent foreign film, Happenstance should leave you happy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3878,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2000-06-21","keywords":"luck,astrology,astrology enthusiast,astrology believer,zodiac sign","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0269002/","name":"Faudel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767710/","name":"Eric Savin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0278705/","name":"Laurent Firode"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021808/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048057/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0278705/","name":"Laurent Firode"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's a remake of the 1950s Spencer Tracy classic (which is great in its own right), but has more warmth about it than that film did. It doesn't rely on slapstick as much as it does on the realistic and ironic lead performance by Steve Martin. This is Martin's second favorite film that he has starred in (behind "Planes, Trains and Automobiles" and followed by "Little Shop of Horrors"), and I can see why.\n\nMartin stars as George Banks, a wealthy upper-class businessman living in Suburban America with a gentle wife (Diane Keaton) and feisty son (Kieran Culkin). His oldest daughter (Kimberly Williams) has finally grown up and departed the house, and the day she comes home with a fiancée he literally has a panic attack.\n\nShe's getting married to possibly the most sensitive man in the world, but George is oblivious to this. All he sees are two big words flashing about the room: LOSING and DAUGHTER. But he is even more upset when he realizes the cost of the wedding: about a couple hundred dollars per head, multiplied by six hundred. You do the math.\n\nNina (Keaton) and her daughter hire Franck Eggelhoffer to handle the wedding, and Eggelhoffer is one of Martin Short's finest roles. Short, an ex-"SNL" member, and star of "Three Amigos" (which also starred Martin), is simply hilarious as the ecstatic and eccentric Frenchman. Amidst the ceremony's setup procedures, George cannot believe he is the only one who realizes just how crazy the cost of the wedding is.\n\nLet's get this straight: "Father of the Bride" is nothing great. It's been done before, and it will be done again (and it has). Yet because of a likable and warm presence, the movie is more than just the sentimental goo that it nearly becomes at certain points throughout. It's truthful, blunt, and occasionally rather funny, which makes for an entertaining and extremely likable motion picture.\n\nThis is not Steve Martin's greatest role. That honor would go to his portrayal of frustrated advertising executive Neal Page in "Planes, Trains and Automobiles." But here he provides us with a character almost as realistic, touching and likable. Neal was the character we empathized with in "Planes," and in "Bride" it's essentially the same for Martin. We're seeing the world through his eyes - which explains the reason it is quite often very overwhelming and comical.\n\nThe movie indeed benefits from Martin's portrayal of a worried father - not as scared by the fact that his daughter is getting married, as he is by the idea that he will undoubtedly lose her to another man. It's a turning point in both their lives, but it doubles for him. Not only has he essentially lost his daughter, but also he has also just been faced with the reality that he is old enough to nearly be a granddad. This would leave good room for a sequel.

It was very much a Michael Bay movie. And before anyone jumps at me to say David Green directed it not Bay, I know, but he's an executive producer on it and it has Bay written all over it. He's known to recycle his movie styles/ effects and I swear it has the exact same score as in the Transformers!? Anyway, I thought it was a fun movie, much like the first one. Me and my friend both left the cinema saying pretty much the same thing. A fun movie, but a pretty forgettable fun movie. I don't know what Bay's interest in Megan Fox is, but for some reason he keeps using her and she is pretty bad in this, though more tolerable than in the first movie. Imo nothing more than eye candy for the viewers, which is visible from one of the very first scenes of her in a school girl outfit. The story line was very Avengers like, we've seen it a million times already, so like I said before, fun to watch, but almost instantly forgettable. Bebop and Rocksteady looked cool, though I would've maybe liked a bigger fight between them and the Turtles. Krang looked awesome and even sounded cool, it's typical Krang really, so was happy with that. Stephen Amell as Casey Jones I guess did the best he could with what he was given, though I couldn't help thinking he was going to pull out his bow and arrow every time he was on. At one point he says "my only goal is to" and I almost blurt out 'to save this city'!! OK, so now to what I enjoyed the most about the movie, the Turtles themselves. I enjoyed all of their portrayals. They all did a very good job in bringing out their personalities in this movie. From Michelangelo's humour to Raphael's bad- assery to Donatello's smarts and Leonardo's command. They were very identifiable characters and I like seeing their chemistry on screen. Overall I give the movie a 6.5 for keeping me entertained, yet I think it's one for the kids more so than the adults.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88378,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-06-29","keywords":"sequel,turtle,based on cartoon,rat,brother brother relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2458694681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NTE2NjcwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1NDA4ODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NTE2NjcwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1NDA4ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Meet the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they return to save the city from a dangerous threat."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1083271/","name":"Megan Fox"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1347153/","name":"Tyler Perry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1757777/","name":"Dave Green"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0032227/","name":"Josh Appelbaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0625858/","name":"André Nemec"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0481990/","name":"Peter Laird"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This may seem like a simple children's movie, but it is so much more than that if you really allow yourself to feel the characters. :) I hope you and your family enjoy the movie as much as we did!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164267,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2012-11-28","keywords":"santa claus character,jack frost character,sandman character,tooth fairy character,easter bunny character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2628363545","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNDk2NTMwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYzNDkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNDk2NTMwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYzNDkyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When the evil spirit Pitch hatches his plan to take over the planet, a group of heroes known as the Immortal Guardians team up for the first time to protect the hopes, beliefs, and imaginations of children all around the world.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0279545/","name":"Isla Fisher"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0709056/","name":"Peter Ramsey"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1865755/","name":"David Lindsay-Abaire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431622/","name":"William Joyce"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He doesn't reject the Rockwellian view of America, but argues that it doesn't tell the whole story.\n\nMoonrise Kingdom is that place of beauty and passion that we all have been in at least once in our lives – the one place on earth where we believe that anything is possible.

Ce genre, les Anglais l'appellent le "whodunit" ("qui a fait le coup"), et les Américains, le "murder mystery". Directement inspiré des écrits de Conan Doyle, de Dorothy Sayers ou bien sûr d'Agatha Christie, le "whodunit" est un genre aussi vieux que le cinéma, mais toujours aussi populaire.</desc>

A car mechanic working in a small French town cannot sexually satisfy his much younger wife, who seems to be fascinated by murderers. His psychiatrist advises him to fake a confession to a murder, and he does - but (coincidence?) the following morning the revolting town bully who lived nearby is found murdered for real, with one of the mechanic's tools. Despite his claims that the confession was all a joke, the police arrest him and he becomes the hero of the town because everyone hated the victim. Meanwhile, his wife finds herself attracted to the psychiatrist, whom she suspects of being the true murderer....As a black comedy, this film is not very funny: in fact, I barely laughed once. It mostly depends on one joke - the entire town population worshipping the presumed murderer so much that they turn him into a local hero - which might have been shocking a few decades ago, but now, not so much. The film works better as a straight whodunit: the identity of the real murderer could have come right out of an Agatha Christie book, and "the moment of realization" is probably the best part of the film. In closing, I have to mention that Nadia Fares is one of the hottest actresses that French cinema has offered us in a long time. Not conventionally attractive, perhaps, certainly not "cute", but with a rough, "you don't want to mess with me" kind of sex appeal - and a knockout body.

A car mechanic working in a small French town cannot sexually satisfy his much younger wife, who seems to be fascinated by murderers. His psychiatrist advises him to fake a confession to a murder, and he does - but (coincidence?) the following morning the revolting town bully who lived nearby is found murdered for real, with one of the mechanic's tools. Despite his claims that the confession was all a joke, the police arrest him and he becomes the hero of the town because everyone hated the victim. Meanwhile, his wife finds herself attracted to the psychiatrist, whom she suspects of being the true murderer....As a black comedy, this film is not very funny: in fact, I barely laughed once. It mostly depends on one joke - the entire town population worshipping the presumed murderer so much that they turn him into a local hero - which might have been shocking a few decades ago, but now, not so much. The film works better as a straight whodunit: the identity of the real murderer could have come right out of an Agatha Christie book, and "the moment of realization" is probably the best part of the film. In closing, I have to mention that Nadia Fares is one of the hottest actresses that French cinema has offered us in a long time. Not conventionally attractive, perhaps, certainly not "cute", but with a rough, "you don't want to mess with me" kind of sex appeal - and a knockout body.

From the title, I was sure I'd see a portmanteau movie of unconnected short stories, similar to 1983's "Twilight Zone: The Movie". But with a kid-centric plot and set in a small American town, the formula is similar to "It" or "Super 8". However, the episodic nature of serial "incidents" aligns it more with the style of the "Final Destination" films.\n\nStella Nicholls (Zoe Margaret Colletti) is a horror geek and aspiring writer living in Mill Valley, a small Pennsylvanian town during the Nixon election of 1968. Stella has a couple of friends: the requisite Scoobie Doo Shaggy character Chuck (Austin Zajur) and the 'sensible' "it's all science" character Auggie (Gabriel Rush). But pursued by local hoodlum Tommy (Austin Abrams), Stella, Chuck and Auggie are thrown together with draft-dodging outsider Ramón (Michael Garza).\n\nThey escape into the local spooky house - a house where legend has it that terrible things were done to a strange albini girl, Sarah. That legend has it that Sarah used to tell local kids scary stories through the walls. And Stella finds a book... a book that appears to be unfinished....\n\nThis is a time when horror films are either "old school" or more psychological in nature (like "Hereditary"). This one has Guillermo del Toro's hand behind that of lead-writers Dan and Kevin Hagerman. And it's firmly old-school. There are some effective (but at times comically created) spooky moments that are scary without being hugely gory. This earns it a UK15, rather than a UK18, certificate. It's disappointing that doesn't stretch to 12A to attract a younger teenage audience, since the source material is actually from a "Goosebumps"-like set of short stories by Alvin Schwartz.\n\nThe story's 'episodes' are nicely varied. At the gross-out end of the scale is an episode with Chuck's sister Ruth (Natalie Ganzhorn) that might get arachnophobes running for the exits. My personal favourite? A 'red room' episode with the oncoming fate comically arriving in slow-motion like the steam-roller in "Austin Powers"!\n\nThis is another film that relies on the quality of its young cast, with the only moderately well-know cast name being Gil Bellows as the local sheriff. In this regard, the stand-out performance is that of Zoe Margaret Colletti who does a fabulous job as Stella. She's been in a few films in the past ("Annie", "Wildlife" and "Skin") but this is her breakout performance in a starring role. She's done her CV a great favour here.\n\nDirected by "Troll Hunter" director André Øvredal, I really enjoyed this one. I'm not a massive fan of 'slasher' style horror films. I have no burning desire to be constantly reminded of what the inside of my body looks like. So this turned out to be much-more to my liking than the normal horror flick. It had enough spookiness to make me turn on the lights when I got back home, but not enough to pervade my dreams.\n\nThe young cast perform well. They are given enough back-story and personality by the script to make you care about their fate.\n\nSo overall, this one comes with a "Recommended for wimps" (like me)!\n\n(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook.

C'est l'une des questions posées par UNE HISTOIRE EXTRAORDINAIRE qui tente de comprendre pourquoi le cinéma donne cette impression de pouvoir capter un événement historique par sa maîtrise formelle de l'image et du son, son rapport au temps... et son éclairage, dans tous les sens du terme !

The real Charles de Gaulle was no saint - he gave little credit to the efforts of the Americans, British and Canadians in liberating France and considered them as little more than another sort of occupying power, and his undiplomatic, even crude speech in Quebec supporting the separatist movement was an amazing slap in the face of his Canadian hosts.

    <title lang="fr">Action Women</title>
    <desc lang="fr">Pendant longtemps, Hollywood a fait appel à des hommes habillés en femme pour réaliser des cascades. Les cascadeuses ont peu à peu investi les tournages, alors qu'émergeait au tournant des années 2000 un cinéma d'action marqué par des personnages féminins forts. Leur ancêtre commun : le lieutenant Ripley, incarné par Sigourney Weaver, dans la saga Alien que Ridley Scott a initiée. James Cameron est le deuxième réalisateur à intégrer une héroïne d'action mythique, Sarah Connor, interprétée par Linda Hamilton dans Terminator 2. La cascadeuse Debbie Evans, as de la conduite en deux roues, l'a doublée. Elle témoigne dans ce documentaire sur son expérience dans le milieu très masculin des cascadeurs professionnels, aux côtés de réalisateurs, journalistes, et surtout, d'autres collègues très expérimentées.</desc>

This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction and over-indulgence.  Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drug addiction. Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you.  I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves.  Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time)  BRUTAL film.  The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role.  Everyone must watch it, for it's entertainment value, and more importantly, it's educational value.

This movie shows the brutal honest side of addiction and over-indulgence.  Not just drugs, although it heavily shows drug addiction. Also shows how one addiction can lead to another and how damaging it can be for you.  I watched this alone, and felt so stunned afterwards, I had to call a friend just to calm my nerves.  Seriously, this is a brutal (one more time)  BRUTAL film.  The acting is wonderful - Ellyn Burnstyn and Jenniffer Connely are just wonderful in this movie, and Marlon Wayons was such a shocker in a serious role.  Everyone must watch it, for it's entertainment value, and more importantly, it's educational value.  But it leaves chills down your spine for it's honesty and unforgiving lessons.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":797867,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2000-12-15","keywords":"drug addiction,sex show,heroin,sex scene,addiction","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Requiem for a Dream","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2156069145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzFmMzRmMjQtOGNiZS00YjdjLThhNTUtM2M1YzI0NDQ1ZTcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzFmMzRmMjQtOGNiZS00YjdjLThhNTUtM2M1YzI0NDQ1ZTcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Artisan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000995/","name":"Ellen Burstyn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001467/","name":"Jared Leto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000124/","name":"Jennifer Connelly"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042682/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067219/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0782968/","name":"Hubert Selby Jr.","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Undercutting other agencies and working out the back garden of their local pub, Angie builds up business, mainly off the back of a large construction job that she supplies immigrant workers to. Paying cash, below minimum wage and irregularly, Angie and Rose start to build up a little nest egg at the expense of their "workforce" but how sustainable is a business built on exploitation?\n\nIt is no surprise that as I watched this film the UK was in the midst of an immigration "debate" (and by "debate" I mean "tabloid-led fuss") because we always seem to be in the middle of a fuss on the subject. So no prizes to Loach for being topical but prizes should go to the film because it is a worthy subject and a solid film. The story is mostly very convincing as it focuses on the daily business of making money with cheap temporary labour and the reality of life in that world. As such it is effortlessly engaging and benefits from us being more or less on the side of the main character Angie, who is only doing what everyone else is doing  screwing down labour costs to maximise profit. From this point we start to get more and more into this world and find it to be just as terrible and exploitative as one would imagine, with blowback on everyone. The need for a narrative flow to the film ultimately means that it does exaggerate at some points to increase drama but mostly it works even if it far from uplifting stuff.\n\nOf course those coming to a Ken Loach film cannot really claim to be surprised by this approach and nor should they be. His direction is excellent and he uses the streets, alleys and dingy flats of this world really well to keep true to the convincing dialogue from Laverty and the cast. I say the cast because I cannot imagine that it was this real on paper without the delivery. Wareing is wonderfully cast and she is instantly recognisable to anyone who knows the "cheeky sexy woman" who work as reps etc in the "real world". She works well alongside an equally good Ellis, who is less showy but no less real. Below them the cast are very convincing and I didn't see anyone "acting" at any point. This makes it easier to take all round because it mostly feels like we are just watching and not having Loach push our face into it.\n\nAs depressing and hopeless as this approach makes the subject, I did not feel it was anything other than fair. We all know that the world is built on money and that if it can be done cheaper, someone will try and do so regardless of the non-financial costs. This film paints a convincing picture that mostly avoids preaching and, aside from the dramatics towards the back end, it uses Angie as our eyes into a world that is exploiting, heartless and desperate. Not perfect but it is relevant and an important part of the debate on the real costs of immigration and capitalism."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5926,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-09-28","keywords":"van,ford,ford transit,honda,immigrant","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1663573/","name":"Kierston Wareing"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254927/","name":"Juliet Ellis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2022053/","name":"Leslaw Zurek"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0516360/","name":"Ken Loach"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059152/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323374/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0491956/","name":"Paul Laverty"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After hearing all the hype from this film it's safe to say I was ecstatic to see it. After the film ended I had a great time, but I felt it was a bit overhyped.\n\nFirst of all the pros of this film, Shia LeBeouff and Dakota Johnson give a great performance with a fun story that kept a smile on my face throughout the film. I also felt the film looked fantastic. The cinematography was gritty, real and did a great job of capturing the swampy area of the North Carolina Outer Banks.\n\nAs for cons I felt that there were some scenes that didn't really work for me. They seemed a little pretentious or out of left field. And I don't know if I really buy the ending of the film. It seemed a little far fetched for my tastes.\n\nHowever, I love this film.

After hearing all the hype from this film it's safe to say I was ecstatic to see it. After the film ended I had a great time, but I felt it was a bit overhyped.\n\nFirst of all the pros of this film, Shia LeBeouff and Dakota Johnson give a great performance with a fun story that kept a smile on my face throughout the film. I also felt the film looked fantastic. The cinematography was gritty, real and did a great job of capturing the swampy area of the North Carolina Outer Banks.\n\nAs for cons I felt that there were some scenes that didn't really work for me. They seemed a little pretentious or out of left field. And I don't know if I really buy the ending of the film. It seemed a little far fetched for my tastes.\n\nHowever, I love this film. Looking at it from a critics standpoint it has some issues, but looking at it from a movie viewer it's a great time! I plan to watch this again as soon as it comes out.

Everyone is imperfect in this show. And even if they all seem greedy, they all have their weaknesses and their motivation is rooted deep in their personalities. For example the son who is temp CEO only wants his father's approval and pride, but gets rejected time after time. He plays the character very well.  It's a healthy dose of drama and humor. I'm not sure yet about The Office - ish camerawork (sudden zooms) because it gives the impression of a mockumentary, as if the cameraman is there and just recording what is happening in real-time. It clashes a bit with the overall style of the show. Same for some of The Office style humor they brought to this show.

Everyone is imperfect in this show. And even if they all seem greedy, they all have their weaknesses and their motivation is rooted deep in their personalities. For example the son who is temp CEO only wants his father's approval and pride, but gets rejected time after time. He plays the character very well.  It's a healthy dose of drama and humor. I'm not sure yet about The Office - ish camerawork (sudden zooms) because it gives the impression of a mockumentary, as if the cameraman is there and just recording what is happening in real-time. It clashes a bit with the overall style of the show. Same for some of The Office style humor they brought to this show. But these are minor things that don't get in the way of the story.\n\nDefinitely recommended. Give it a few episodes!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65778,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-06-03","keywords":"media empire,patriarchy,wealth,dysfunctional family,business","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007814/","name":"Hiam Abbass","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1002609/","name":"Nicholas Braun","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004051/","name":"Brian Cox"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0186190/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0702468/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0770923/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1104036/","name":"Jesse Armstrong"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3233792793","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjgxZDg0ZGItNTY4Ny00MmQ4LTg4M2QtNjA4NDYzMGI3Y2JiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjgxZDg0ZGItNTY4Ny00MmQ4LTg4M2QtNjA4NDYzMGI3Y2JiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg","description":"Ambushed by his rebellious son Kendall at the end of Season two, Logan Roy begins Season three in a perilous position, scrambling to secure familial, political, and financial alliances.

C'est au cours d'une de ses missions qu'il fait la connaissance de Judy, mère divorcée d'un garçon, à laquelle il s'attache immédiatement. Mais ce que Judy ignore, c'est que Mike, Tom et leurs amis, racistes, viennent de prendre possession d'un cinéma désaffecté pour le transformer en musée glorifiant les actions passée du Klu Klux Klan. Le révérend Kenndy, qui tente d'apaiser les tensions entre les communautés, est consterné par cette nouvelle.</desc>

My initial reaction upon leaving the screening room was it was astonishing, a magnificent achievement that stands tall as one of the year's best movies. As the film continues to settle within my cinematic soul, this very well could be the best film of the year, anchored by a career best performance from the amazing Benedict Cumberbatch. \n\nFull disclosure, I'm fairly oblivious to European history and the heroes that had a hand in one of the deadliest wars in history. I've heard the name Alan Turing from high school and college but either didn't care enough to learn or have no recollection of his contributions. Minutes following the screening, Amazon.com got $15.82 from my bank account in order to read "Alan Turing: The Enigma," the book in which screenwriter Graham Moore based the story upon. Telling the story of Alan Turing, a mathematician who in 1939 led a pioneer in cracking one of the most difficult codes in history. His contributions paved the way for essentially the way we exist now. However, Turing, who is a homosexual, has to wrestle with his secret in order to keep his status and his work years later.\n\nMasterfully told and encompassing an emotional complexity, Tyldum's film is both engrossing and disturbing. It has genius aspirations in which it wants to exist in the cinematic world. It's an impeccable thriller, taut and brilliant, exploring the horrors of war along with the choices that doom mankind for all eternity. Tyldum is methodical and precise in which he decides to unravel the story, Turing is one of the fallen heroes of our history and his story stands as one of the most tragic. Screenwriter Moore crafts a murky, dark, yet totally enjoyable spy film that stands taller than any James Bond film ever released. It's a sure-fire Oscar contender for several Academy Awards including Best Picture. They should feel so lucky to have the gumption to choose something this methodical and majestic.\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch continues to climb the ladder as one of the best actors working today. After impressive performances August: Osage County, 12 Years a Slave, and TV's "Sherlock," this is the role that will make him a bonafide movie star. Oscar-winner or not, this will be looked upon like the greats such as Gene Hackman in The French Connection or any legendary 70's movie that you love today. Cumberbatch hones in on all of Turing's character flaws and good qualities that make him a real person. He constructs him from the toes up, inflicting mannerisms and behaviors that all ring true. He stimulates all the sensual beats that keep us fixated on a performance. I can't help but go back to someone like Joaquin Phoenix in The Master, who delivered a construction of epic proportions. Though based on a real person, the talented Cumberbatch ignites his own masterpiece performance. He follows the demons of Turing down to his bones. Unsure, arrogant, and dismissive to the world around him, Turing shows only what he must, what he chooses, and every once in a while, we get a front seat to his soul. Thank you Cumberbatch.\n\nThe rest of the cast is completely on their game. It's probably a contender for the SAG Ensemble prize. Academy Award nominee Keira Knightley, as the feisty and fiery Joan Clark, is as loose and comfortable as I've ever seen her. She wears Joan like an old coat from the back of the closet. Remembering it fondly and seeing that it fits just perfect. She has all the things that make up an Oscar nominee; a scene that will likely bring you to tears, plenty of scenes that play as the comic relief in a dark tale, and being simply charming in every part of the film. \n\nI don't know when it's going to happen but the world needs to make Matthew Goode a mega-star. In his brief time on-screen, Goode makes his mark, becoming essentially a co-anchor with Knightley of the supporting players, showcasing a reason to give this guy his own leading role sooner rather than later. As our resident sleazy authority figure, Charles Dance shows that he's still got it. Mark Strong and Allen Leech also deliver memorable, fascinating scenes, both getting an opportunity to shine.\n\nTechnical merits are no shortage of excellence on display. Oscar- winning Editor William Goldenberg (Argo) shows that tension is his second language. Cutting the film to perfection, and forcing your heart into throat, this espionage thriller succeeds for general audiences because of Goldenberg's efforts. It's something that anyone can seek out and get fully immersed into. Alexandre Desplat tacks another impressive composition to his already thick resume. With films like The Grand Budapest Hotel already in his arsenal, I assume this to be another Oscar citation in his future. Shot by the talented Oscar Faura, responsible for painting the canvas that was J.A. Bayona's The Impossible, he utilizes the standard brilliance of capturing a moment. Knows when to pull back and get close. Let's not forget the Production and Costume Design by Maria Djurkovic and Sammy Sheldon Differ. Those two will surely be mentioned for the rest of the film year.\n\nThe Imitation Game is assertive and makes a serious claim as one of the best spy thrillers ever made. There are sub plots that all resonate and never feel forced. This will not only keep your tension level at a fever pitch but could leave you in tears to walk home with. It's a complete realistic view at the spy game that stands as one of the best films of the year and a performance for the ages from Benedict Cumberbatch. A captivating achievement that I'll likely remember for some time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":720004,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-07","keywords":"cryptography,world war two,enigma code,mathematician,closeted gay man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3398414105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzODk5OTY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU1NjUyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzODk5OTY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU1NjUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on the real life story of legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing, the film portrays the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his brilliant team of code-breakers at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212722/","name":"Benedict Cumberbatch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0328828/","name":"Matthew Goode"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878763/","name":"Morten Tyldum"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319513/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251858/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0457197/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2441699/","name":"Graham Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0388132/","name":"Andrew Hodges"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A captivating achievement that I'll likely remember for some time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":720004,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-07","keywords":"cryptography,world war two,enigma code,mathematician,closeted gay man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3398414105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzODk5OTY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU1NjUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMzODk5OTY5OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU1NjUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Based on the real life story of legendary cryptanalyst Alan Turing, the film portrays the nail-biting race against time by Turing and his brilliant team of code-breakers at Britain's top-secret Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, during the darkest days of World War II.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212722/","name":"Benedict Cumberbatch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0328828/","name":"Matthew Goode"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878763/","name":"Morten Tyldum"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319513/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251858/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0457197/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2441699/","name":"Graham Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0388132/","name":"Andrew Hodges"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A recently disgraced big-city cop moves to a small town just in time to lead an investigation in a rare murder. With a resentful less-experienced partner he uncovers a lot of uncomfortable secrets about a community in which anyone can be a suspect. But a show doesn't have to be wholly original to be good. Just look at the two separate high-quality adaptations of the Danish series "The Bridge". Besides all a mystery series has to deliver is: an identifiable victim, plenty of suspects, and multiple twists. On these three fronts "La Treve" fully succeeds. Not to mention it does plenty to distinguish itself from that similar BBC series. Surprisingly it has an even darker view of humanity. As the unstable detective pessimistically asserts to his underling "Anyone is capable of murder". A point that is driven home hauntingly by beginning nearly every episode with a different character's nightmare of how they might be involved. Not to mention the fact that the entire series is told in retrospective from a mental hospital, where the main character has found himself following the events of the story. Yoan Peeters was a detective on the rise in Brussels until he got four members of his squad killed when he ordered them into a drug den without waiting for back-up. Like everything else in this series it is much more complicated than it first appears. But with that cloud hanging over his head he returns to his childhood home of Heiderfeld, with his sullen daughter who missed the big city even before she left. He hasn't even reported to work yet when the overwhelmed young detective Sebastian Drummer conscripts him into helping with a just discovered dead body. Most of the force has never dealt with such a situation and they need help. This series makes a better case than most crime shows about how resources and finances dictate the level of police-work. When it looks like this was a suicide the Chief cancels an autopsy, not because he's trying to cover anything up, but because the town can't afford it. The unspoken villain of the series is poverty. Poor economics has forced many in this simple town to succumb to various forms of corruption. The only dependable income for some residents seems to come from strong-arming farmers to sell for the new electric dam or throwing a soccer match to benefit mob gamblers. The latter of which may have contributed to the murder of the preeminent defender of the local club. Seen only in video messages to his family and the aforementioned dream sequences his name was Driss Asani, a drafted prospect from Africa; and as you may have guessed his death doesn't stay ruled a suicide. Yoann's detective acumen finds more than enough evidence of homicide and even more possible suspects. For a quiet rural community it certainly has more than it's share of decidedly modern eccentrics. Peeling away the placid exterior of the community certainly reveals a lot of shady characters that are not eager to share their secrets with the police. But does having something to hide automatically make someone a murderer, as the amphetamine-fueled Yoann too often accuses. Or are they all guilty of feeding a growing monster of corruption that would eventually require a human sacrifice for their collective sins. Yoann's investigation creates much more damage than it ever does justice. It leaves no one unscathed, especially himself. But this unflinching look at the desperate people created by desperate times does prove that his cynical observation was correct. Anyone is capable of murder.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6150,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-02-21","keywords":"body","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1286724/","name":"Yoann Blanc"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4978674/","name":"Jasmina Douieb"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2727232/","name":"Lara Hubinont"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150005/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011677/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2809451/","name":"Stéphane Bergmans"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2860392/","name":"Benjamin d'Aoust"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950061/","name":"Matthieu Donck"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3237069081","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk0OWRhYTItMmIwOC00OGJlLWFkNmQtNmYwNWI1NmFiZmQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk0OWRhYTItMmIwOC00OGJlLWFkNmQtNmYwNWI1NmFiZmQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION here, folks, no benevolent GREEN MILE guards or saintly supernatural inmates. OZ tells it like it is, and baby, it ain't pretty.\n\nUsing at times a sense of hyper-realism, (in the narrations of the excellent Harold Perrineau, who serves as the show's conscience and Greek chorus), OZ shows us both the profane and profound aspects of prison life that we good, law-abiding citizens don't like to think about. We have the "authorities" to take care of that, don't we?\n\nExceptional art, no matter what the medium, has the ability to move us, make us think, make us feel both things we embrace and things we reject. The power this show has to polarize viewers into two different camps--love it or hate it--is proof enough that Tom Fontana and Barry Levinson, the forces behind HOMICIDE: LIFE ON THE STREETS, have fashioned something we haven't seen the likes of in a very long time.\n\nI would strongly suggest that anyone who has not yet seen it give it a try, if you have HBO. Then I dare you to tear yourself away from it. It's rare television that makes you sit up, take notice, and actually care about even the minor characters in an ensemble such as this, no matter how heinous their crimes, or how street-and-battle-hardened their exteriors.\n\nAugustus Hill, Simon Adebisi, Tobias Beecher, Vern Schillinger, Chris Keller, Jefferson Keane, Ryan O'Reilly, Kareem Said, Nino Schibetta, Bob Rebadow, Tim McManus, Warden Leo Glynn, Sister Peter-Marie, Father Ray, Officer Diane Wittlesey and all the others will imprint themselves on your memory and stay there, until you can't wait to find out what happens next.\n\nA blend of black humor and outright horror, cutting commentary and the basest brutality, it is one of the very few shows being done now that can reveal the most majestic qualities of the human spirit. The ongoing struggle to resist surrendering to impulses and urges that cause the evil that men do, in the one place you would least expect to find any light--in a sea of human misery and darkness.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":93779,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-07-12","keywords":"male rape,prison,italian,gay,aryan brotherhood","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001368/","name":"Ernie Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799777/","name":"J.K.

I decided to give the movie a try since it does deal with one of my favorite horror topics...zombies!\n\nAs a horror movie Resident Evil fails miserably, it's not scary and contains only small amounts of suspense.  It is much better as an action film although much of the action is chaotic, accompanied by lame heavy metal/thrash music.  But seeing as it is based on a video game and made primarily for teenage boy video game addicts it is quite good in and of itself.\n\nThe movie plays well, even though it is apparent that some scenes have been cut to achieve an R-rating.  The characters do what they need to do in order to survive.\n\nOne small problem with the movie is the relative lack of zombie screen time. They do appear in two major scenes but most of the time the hallways are clear.  This hive was supposed to employ thousands of people but you only ever see 100 zombies at the most.  Also, the humans seem to be able to travel easily wherever they have to go until it is time for another action sequence.  It would have been better if they constantly ran into single zombies which they were able to easily dispose of, but this is nit-picking on my part.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the movie and I have never seen, let alone played, the video game.

They do appear in two major scenes but most of the time the hallways are clear.  This hive was supposed to employ thousands of people but you only ever see 100 zombies at the most.  Also, the humans seem to be able to travel easily wherever they have to go until it is time for another action sequence.  It would have been better if they constantly ran into single zombies which they were able to easily dispose of, but this is nit-picking on my part.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the movie and I have never seen, let alone played, the video game.  I'm not sure if this movie will have the staying power over multiple viewings for me (like Aliens) but it's a very good single viewing action picture.  Easily the best movie I have seen based on a video game. Despite it's flaws Resident Evil rates a 7 out of 10, if taken more seriously this could have been a really good movie.  It would have been nice to see a George Romero version.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":257871,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2002-08-28","keywords":"doberman,cut into pieces,zombie,commando,kissing while having sex","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Resident Evil","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2894266649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjI4NDZjNWUtNDBkMy00ZTY5LWJkMjEtMmFhZWIxZjAyZjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjI4NDZjNWUtNDBkMy00ZTY5LWJkMjEtMmFhZWIxZjAyZjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000170/","name":"Milla Jovovich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735442/","name":"Michelle Rodriguez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1011675/","name":"Ryan McCluskey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0027271/","name":"Paul W.S.

This is not to say it didn't show some small moments of promise but it never quite rises to the occasion.

The best attack scene takes place in the house where our heroes have boarded themselves up but this isn't enough to save the film. The director was obviously asleep at the wheel and it shows when one of the characters ( I wont say which as not to spoil it) suffers an injury to the leg and later seems to forget they should be limping and they can be seen walking around like nothing ever happened. Where in the world was Wes??? Yes the setup is as old as wine but I still had hopes that the makers would inject some fresh blood into the story; it never happened. The film is hurt by uninspired camera work and the even more uninspired direction of Mastandrea.

As they venture deeper into the woods, they face an uncertain and bloodcurdling fate.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0295700/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Li-1"},"dateCreated":"2004-11-19","inLanguage":"English","name":"A slasher that needs more...well, everything!","reviewBody":"Rating: ** out of ****\n\nWrong Turn seemingly has all the ingredients necessary for an effective slasher: a good setting and decent premise, a very attractive and likable cast, memorable make-up and gore effect, and a refreshingly unironic tone that reminds us of the days when old-fashioned horror didn't rely on self-conscious humor to pass for entertainment value. In that manner, Wrong Turn is actually a little nostalgic, not unlike the rest of the recent batch of backwoods horror flicks (Cabin Fever, House of 1000 Corpses, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake).\n\nBut aside from two solid setpieces, the movie rarely fulfills its (admittedly limited) potential. The script matters little in this subgenre, but there's almost no plot after the ill-fated teens arrive at the mountain men's cabin. This is about twenty-five minutes into the film, after we've already dispensed with the obligatory character intros (basically: 3 hot chicks and 3 hunky, but also surprisingly personable guys) and whatever reasons they have for being stranded in the middle of nowhere, West Virginia.\n\nEverything after that is typical cat-and-mouse filler, the killers (three inbred, cannibalistic hillbillies) searching for their prey while our protagonists run and hide behind trees. There's very little in the way of suspense, namely because it's so obvious who's going to live and who's going to die and in what order. And because the cast is so small, you can't even enjoy a particularly large body count (half the main cast is killed off less than forty minutes into the picture).\n\nWrong Turn is also missing much of what makes slasher movies fun to watch: explicit nudity and the occasional bit of gratuitous sex. With such an attractive cast (Emmanuelle Chriqui is cute, and Eliza Dushku and especially Lindy Booth are total hotties), the movie regrettably skimps on the goods. Such a complaint probably wouldn't matter if the characters were better developed, but despite a talented cast, the most interesting aspect character-wise is noting how different a couple Lindy Booth and Kevin Zegers played in Dawn of the Dead. \n\nAs for the rest of the cast, Desmond Harrington is a solid actor, but does little more than run, grunt, and dive headfirst into every dangerous stunt (his volunteering for every dangerous move actually makes him pretty likable even when we question his logic). Eliza Dushku simply coasts on her looks (and proves that all hottie TV actresses are destined to play a big screen scream queen at least once in their lives), while Emmanuelle Chriqui just shrieks her way through her part. Standing out a little is Jeremy Sisto, who infuses a bit of humor into an otherwise very disposable role.\n\nThe forest is something of a disappointment, as well. With a potentially excellent setting at his disposal, director Rob Schmidt fails to generate any creepy atmosphere in an environment where you'd think atmosphere would almost come naturally (to be fair, a lot of horror movies also seem to have this problem; the last time I saw a forest setting utilized perfectly was in 2003's terrifically frightening Dead End). \n\nDespite the fact I've done little more than harp on the film, there's no denying that the middle half-hour is occasionally entertaining. There's a semi-suspenseful scene set in a vehicular junkyard (finally, a little variety in setting, huh?) and another effective sequence set inside a watchtower that segues to an exciting chase atop the branches of some very large trees. The murders are too sparse, given the small cast, but they're gruesome and memorable, and thankfully not as relentlessly cruel as the deaths in Cabin Fever, but boast just the right touch of menace and hard-edged violence.\n\nThe three hillbilly killers aren't quite as successful as the gore; in fact, seeing less of them would have been appreciated, considering their grotesque appearance almost crosses into the realm of self-parody. Even The X-Files knew better than that. \n\nAnyway, whatever momentum the middle half-hour built up comes crashing down in the final minutes, with the film actually closing out with an explosion, surely a sign of desperation on the part of the screenwriter if he can't come up with any brighter ideas in a slasher (I was, in fact, about to give the movie a ** 1/2 until the climax). Overall, this is mildly recommended to slasher fans or anyone who wants to gawk at Dushku for a little over an hour. Wrong Turn at least has its heart set in the right place, which is more than can be said for most slashers these days."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":115207,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-04-07","keywords":"west virginia,bound and gagged,voyeur,voyeurism,flat tire","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wrong Turn","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946026265","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY3YjZjODQtMzNkZC00ZTZjLTg2NTMtN2UyN2NiNTk1ZTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY3YjZjODQtMzNkZC00ZTZjLTg2NTMtN2UyN2NiNTk1ZTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "Coming Soon""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244630/","name":"Eliza Dushku"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004825/","name":"Emmanuelle Chriqui"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003343/","name":"Rob Schmidt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029749/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568416/","name":"Alan B.

As they venture deeper into the woods, they face an uncertain and bloodcurdling fate.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0295700/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Li-1","dateCreated":"2004-11-19","inLanguage":"English","name":"A slasher that needs more...well, everything!","reviewBody":"Rating: ** out of ****\n\nWrong Turn seemingly has all the ingredients necessary for an effective slasher: a good setting and decent premise, a very attractive and likable cast, memorable make-up and gore effect, and a refreshingly unironic tone that reminds us of the days when old-fashioned horror didn't rely on self-conscious humor to pass for entertainment value. In that manner, Wrong Turn is actually a little nostalgic, not unlike the rest of the recent batch of backwoods horror flicks (Cabin Fever, House of 1000 Corpses, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake).\n\nBut aside from two solid setpieces, the movie rarely fulfills its (admittedly limited) potential. The script matters little in this subgenre, but there's almost no plot after the ill-fated teens arrive at the mountain men's cabin. This is about twenty-five minutes into the film, after we've already dispensed with the obligatory character intros (basically: 3 hot chicks and 3 hunky, but also surprisingly personable guys) and whatever reasons they have for being stranded in the middle of nowhere, West Virginia.\n\nEverything after that is typical cat-and-mouse filler, the killers (three inbred, cannibalistic hillbillies) searching for their prey while our protagonists run and hide behind trees. There's very little in the way of suspense, namely because it's so obvious who's going to live and who's going to die and in what order. And because the cast is so small, you can't even enjoy a particularly large body count (half the main cast is killed off less than forty minutes into the picture).\n\nWrong Turn is also missing much of what makes slasher movies fun to watch: explicit nudity and the occasional bit of gratuitous sex. With such an attractive cast (Emmanuelle Chriqui is cute, and Eliza Dushku and especially Lindy Booth are total hotties), the movie regrettably skimps on the goods. Such a complaint probably wouldn't matter if the characters were better developed, but despite a talented cast, the most interesting aspect character-wise is noting how different a couple Lindy Booth and Kevin Zegers played in Dawn of the Dead. \n\nAs for the rest of the cast, Desmond Harrington is a solid actor, but does little more than run, grunt, and dive headfirst into every dangerous stunt (his volunteering for every dangerous move actually makes him pretty likable even when we question his logic). Eliza Dushku simply coasts on her looks (and proves that all hottie TV actresses are destined to play a big screen scream queen at least once in their lives), while Emmanuelle Chriqui just shrieks her way through her part. Standing out a little is Jeremy Sisto, who infuses a bit of humor into an otherwise very disposable role.\n\nThe forest is something of a disappointment, as well. With a potentially excellent setting at his disposal, director Rob Schmidt fails to generate any creepy atmosphere in an environment where you'd think atmosphere would almost come naturally (to be fair, a lot of horror movies also seem to have this problem; the last time I saw a forest setting utilized perfectly was in 2003's terrifically frightening Dead End). \n\nDespite the fact I've done little more than harp on the film, there's no denying that the middle half-hour is occasionally entertaining. There's a semi-suspenseful scene set in a vehicular junkyard (finally, a little variety in setting, huh?) and another effective sequence set inside a watchtower that segues to an exciting chase atop the branches of some very large trees. The murders are too sparse, given the small cast, but they're gruesome and memorable, and thankfully not as relentlessly cruel as the deaths in Cabin Fever, but boast just the right touch of menace and hard-edged violence.\n\nThe three hillbilly killers aren't quite as successful as the gore; in fact, seeing less of them would have been appreciated, considering their grotesque appearance almost crosses into the realm of self-parody. Even The X-Files knew better than that. \n\nAnyway, whatever momentum the middle half-hour built up comes crashing down in the final minutes, with the film actually closing out with an explosion, surely a sign of desperation on the part of the screenwriter if he can't come up with any brighter ideas in a slasher (I was, in fact, about to give the movie a ** 1/2 until the climax). Overall, this is mildly recommended to slasher fans or anyone who wants to gawk at Dushku for a little over an hour. Wrong Turn at least has its heart set in the right place, which is more than can be said for most slashers these days.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":115207,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-04-07","keywords":"west virginia,bound and gagged,voyeur,voyeurism,flat tire","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wrong Turn","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946026265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY3YjZjODQtMzNkZC00ZTZjLTg2NTMtN2UyN2NiNTk1ZTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY3YjZjODQtMzNkZC00ZTZjLTg2NTMtN2UyN2NiNTk1ZTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "Coming Soon"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244630/","name":"Eliza Dushku","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004825/","name":"Emmanuelle Chriqui"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003343/","name":"Rob Schmidt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029749/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568416/","name":"Alan B.

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton.

Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66116,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-08-27","keywords":"stripper,premarital sex,sex standing up,sex scene,belgrade serbia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3721243673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAxMjUwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY4NTIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An ex-CIA operative is brought back in on a very personal mission and finds himself pitted against his former pupil in a deadly game involving high level CIA officials and the Russian president-elect.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3478396/","name":"Luke Bracey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1385871/","name":"Olga Kurylenko"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002044/","name":"Roger Donaldson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088199/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0500612/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3360218/","name":"Michael Finch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2244980/","name":"Karl Gajdusek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1952653/","name":"Bill Granger"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While the two movies are about as similar as Dr. No is to GoldenEye (thankfully), I suppose comparisons between one non-stop adventure film and other are inevitable. In the end, what really counts when determining a film's quality is the level to which it can entertain. And if there is one thing The Mummy did well, it was entertain. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles.\n\nThe Mummy Returns is easy to see as being another sequel churned out to satiate the greedy money-machine that Hollywood has become, but it has a few things working for it. One thing that is immediately obvious is that the sequel was very much intended to be a film that could be enjoyed without ever having seen the original. The only references to the previous film are done to fill in the narrative gaps about who Imhotep is, and why he is the way he is. The addition of The Scorpion King was an interesting effort to give the film a new antagonist, but the lack of screentime didn't work well in this tangent's favour. Another tangent that could have been better developed was the rivalry between Imhotep's girlfriend and whatever her name was. Imhotep originally mistook Rachel Weisz's character for being his girlfriend reincarnated, so the use of a woman who looks exactly like her while creating this new tangent needed to be developed differently.\n\nMost people won't give a damn about complex story tangents and will want to know if this film is entertaining. And it is entertaining, alright. There is barely a dull moment in the film's substantial running length, and Oded Fehr does a bang-up job of providing a Mad-Max-cum-Indiana-Jones hero. I want to know where they get those groovy costumes and tattoos from, they look quite nice. Anyway, when all is said and done, this is an eight out of ten film. A few badly constructed story details here and there, but some extremely entertaining action sequences make up for them. Don't listen to the nay-sayers. This is matinee-style material at its (almost) best. Get the DVD when it comes out, it will at least tide you over until George Lucas gets his head out of his proverbial and realises that the VHS era is well and truly over."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":311606,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2001-06-06","keywords":"mummy character,good versus evil,evil woman,villain,villainess","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3930372889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTEzOTZlODgtZjMyYi00YzU0LThlNDktNGJhMWYxMDc3ODI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTEzOTZlODgtZjMyYi00YzU0LThlNDktNGJhMWYxMDc3ODI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001838/","name":"Rachel Weisz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001314/","name":"John Hannah"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038478/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While the two movies are about as similar as Dr. No is to GoldenEye (thankfully), I suppose comparisons between one non-stop adventure film and other are inevitable. In the end, what really counts when determining a film's quality is the level to which it can entertain. And if there is one thing The Mummy did well, it was entertain. Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, and Arnold Vosloo were very well chosen for their roles.\n\nThe Mummy Returns is easy to see as being another sequel churned out to satiate the greedy money-machine that Hollywood has become, but it has a few things working for it. One thing that is immediately obvious is that the sequel was very much intended to be a film that could be enjoyed without ever having seen the original. The only references to the previous film are done to fill in the narrative gaps about who Imhotep is, and why he is the way he is. The addition of The Scorpion King was an interesting effort to give the film a new antagonist, but the lack of screentime didn't work well in this tangent's favour. Another tangent that could have been better developed was the rivalry between Imhotep's girlfriend and whatever her name was. Imhotep originally mistook Rachel Weisz's character for being his girlfriend reincarnated, so the use of a woman who looks exactly like her while creating this new tangent needed to be developed differently.\n\nMost people won't give a damn about complex story tangents and will want to know if this film is entertaining. And it is entertaining, alright. There is barely a dull moment in the film's substantial running length, and Oded Fehr does a bang-up job of providing a Mad-Max-cum-Indiana-Jones hero. I want to know where they get those groovy costumes and tattoos from, they look quite nice. Anyway, when all is said and done, this is an eight out of ten film. A few badly constructed story details here and there, but some extremely entertaining action sequences make up for them. Don't listen to the nay-sayers. This is matinee-style material at its (almost) best. Get the DVD when it comes out, it will at least tide you over until George Lucas gets his head out of his proverbial and realises that the VHS era is well and truly over.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":311606,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2001-06-06","keywords":"mummy character,good versus evil,evil woman,villain,villainess","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3930372889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTEzOTZlODgtZjMyYi00YzU0LThlNDktNGJhMWYxMDc3ODI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTEzOTZlODgtZjMyYi00YzU0LThlNDktNGJhMWYxMDc3ODI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001838/","name":"Rachel Weisz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001314/","name":"John Hannah"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038478/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers"],"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was very excited when I started seeing teasers for this sequel to be shown in July, mostly because it was quite unexpected.\n\nThis movie has all the required elements of epic action, sense of humor and great special effects. Of course there is still the swashbuckling hero Rick O'Connell played in grand style by Brendan Fraser. He undoubtedly has this action-comedy genre sewn up right in his alley. John Hannah is still around playing his brother-in-law, Jonathan, in his old annoying manner.\n\nFor the new stuff, the setting shift to China as the titular "Mummy" now refers to an ancient Chinese emperor who desired immortality, played by Jet Li (who really personified his anti-hero role with relish here). The emperor sought the help of a "witch" (played with much bravado by Michelle Yeoh), with whom he gets attracted to. However, the witch fell in love with his main general (played by Russell Wong, whom you'd wonder why he isn't getting more breaks in Hollywood). From hence starts the conflict and the resultant curse on which the movie stands.\n\nThe requisite martial arts you would expect in a movie set in China are of course in full play. Very well choreographed, especially that thrilling sword fight between Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. The exciting action sequences inside the booby-trapped lost tomb, the truck and chariot (!) chase in the streets of Shanghai and the final fight sequence with the "Mummy" are all executed very well as in the two previous installments.\n\nBut then there are the drawbacks that for me pulls this one down to a five star rating. The quality of the spoken Mandarin is at times unintelligible. However, the major beef involves what for me are severely miscast actors.\n\nThe actor who plays the now college-aged son of the O'Connells, Alex, looks too mature to be the son of Brendan Fraser. I just checked to see that the actor Luke Ford was born in 1981, but he looked older than that, so it was a bit of a stretch to believe that he is Brendan's son. Furthermore, he also does not act like a son, but more like Brendan's younger brother.\n\nBut the worst and damaging mistake was the decision to cast Maria Bello in the beloved role of Evelyn O'Connell, which is wholly owned by the more beautiful and credible Rachel Weisz. I felt absolutely NO chemistry between Maria and Brendan. Her acting was also quite wretched when compared to Ms. Weisz, who was able to maintain her intellectuality, demureness and gentility on top of her topnotch fighting skills. Ms. Bello fails miserably in this regard to recapture the unique character of Evie we have loved before, in my opinion.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":155722,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"shared universe,3rd century b.c.,oxfordshire south east englend,motor car,male professor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Visiting the Emperor's Camp and the Terra Cotta Warriors","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2374239001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzNDYyMTY3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDA0MjczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzNDYyMTY3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDA0MjczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The action sequences and battles at the Emperor's Camp"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001472/","name":"Jet Li"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004742/","name":"Maria Bello"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003418/","name":"Rob Cohen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086885/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332184/","name":"Alfred Gough"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587692/","name":"Miles Millar"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0049721/","name":"John L.

I was very excited when I started seeing teasers for this sequel to be shown in July, mostly because it was quite unexpected.\n\nThis movie has all the required elements of epic action, sense of humor and great special effects. Of course there is still the swashbuckling hero Rick O'Connell played in grand style by Brendan Fraser. He undoubtedly has this action-comedy genre sewn up right in his alley. John Hannah is still around playing his brother-in-law, Jonathan, in his old annoying manner.\n\nFor the new stuff, the setting shift to China as the titular "Mummy" now refers to an ancient Chinese emperor who desired immortality, played by Jet Li (who really personified his anti-hero role with relish here). The emperor sought the help of a "witch" (played with much bravado by Michelle Yeoh), with whom he gets attracted to. However, the witch fell in love with his main general (played by Russell Wong, whom you'd wonder why he isn't getting more breaks in Hollywood). From hence starts the conflict and the resultant curse on which the movie stands.\n\nThe requisite martial arts you would expect in a movie set in China are of course in full play. Very well choreographed, especially that thrilling sword fight between Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. The exciting action sequences inside the booby-trapped lost tomb, the truck and chariot (!) chase in the streets of Shanghai and the final fight sequence with the "Mummy" are all executed very well as in the two previous installments.\n\nBut then there are the drawbacks that for me pulls this one down to a five star rating. The quality of the spoken Mandarin is at times unintelligible. However, the major beef involves what for me are severely miscast actors.\n\nThe actor who plays the now college-aged son of the O'Connells, Alex, looks too mature to be the son of Brendan Fraser. I just checked to see that the actor Luke Ford was born in 1981, but he looked older than that, so it was a bit of a stretch to believe that he is Brendan's son. Furthermore, he also does not act like a son, but more like Brendan's younger brother.\n\nBut the worst and damaging mistake was the decision to cast Maria Bello in the beloved role of Evelyn O'Connell, which is wholly owned by the more beautiful and credible Rachel Weisz.

I was very excited when I started seeing teasers for this sequel to be shown in July, mostly because it was quite unexpected.\n\nThis movie has all the required elements of epic action, sense of humor and great special effects. Of course there is still the swashbuckling hero Rick O'Connell played in grand style by Brendan Fraser. He undoubtedly has this action-comedy genre sewn up right in his alley. John Hannah is still around playing his brother-in-law, Jonathan, in his old annoying manner.\n\nFor the new stuff, the setting shift to China as the titular "Mummy" now refers to an ancient Chinese emperor who desired immortality, played by Jet Li (who really personified his anti-hero role with relish here). The emperor sought the help of a "witch" (played with much bravado by Michelle Yeoh), with whom he gets attracted to. However, the witch fell in love with his main general (played by Russell Wong, whom you'd wonder why he isn't getting more breaks in Hollywood). From hence starts the conflict and the resultant curse on which the movie stands.\n\nThe requisite martial arts you would expect in a movie set in China are of course in full play. Very well choreographed, especially that thrilling sword fight between Jet Li and Michelle Yeoh. The exciting action sequences inside the booby-trapped lost tomb, the truck and chariot (!) chase in the streets of Shanghai and the final fight sequence with the "Mummy" are all executed very well as in the two previous installments.\n\nBut then there are the drawbacks that for me pulls this one down to a five star rating. The quality of the spoken Mandarin is at times unintelligible. However, the major beef involves what for me are severely miscast actors.\n\nThe actor who plays the now college-aged son of the O'Connells, Alex, looks too mature to be the son of Brendan Fraser. I just checked to see that the actor Luke Ford was born in 1981, but he looked older than that, so it was a bit of a stretch to believe that he is Brendan's son. Furthermore, he also does not act like a son, but more like Brendan's younger brother.\n\nBut the worst and damaging mistake was the decision to cast Maria Bello in the beloved role of Evelyn O'Connell, which is wholly owned by the more beautiful and credible Rachel Weisz. I felt absolutely NO chemistry between Maria and Brendan. Her acting was also quite wretched when compared to Ms. Weisz, who was able to maintain her intellectuality, demureness and gentility on top of her topnotch fighting skills. Ms. Bello fails miserably in this regard to recapture the unique character of Evie we have loved before, in my opinion.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":155722,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"shared universe,3rd century b.c.,oxfordshire south east englend,motor car,male professor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Visiting the Emperor's Camp and the Terra Cotta Warriors","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2374239001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzNDYyMTY3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDA0MjczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjkzNDYyMTY3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDA0MjczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The action sequences and battles at the Emperor's Camp","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001472/","name":"Jet Li","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004742/","name":"Maria Bello"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003418/","name":"Rob Cohen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086885/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332184/","name":"Alfred Gough","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587692/","name":"Miles Millar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0049721/","name":"John L.

Can anyone expect Tarantino's movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker?  Of course not!  Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the '60s and '70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It's impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride's gory face as she's introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride 'Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?\n\nThis film's a sampling of the Tarantino 'fury,' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It's almost as if I'm watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that's displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It's examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite 'old-school' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there's a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.\n\n Even at 'The House Of Blue Leaves', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill's DVAS members.'  My adrenaline's still flowing as I'm recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

Can anyone expect Tarantino's movie not to be a true mind-blowing, adrenaline-pumping shocker?  Of course not!  Gritty and slick, his first installment of KB rocks with moody western imagery, the '60s and '70s-era of Hong Kong martial arts-action, the influences of the ritualistic samurai swordsmanship, and Japanese anime. Like in all his films, Tarantino never fails to merge dark humor with terror. It's impossible not to smile over the Shaw Bros.' iconic introduction ploy and the De Palma-esque split screens. Observe the `Carrie' blank-starry eyed image settled on The Bride's gory face as she's introduced to the audience. Perhaps, Uma Thurman in her yellow suit is a salute to the yellow-suited Bruce Lee in his last film, The Game of Death. Or is The Bride 'Just another little Western girl playing at being a samurai' - as O-Ren Ishii blatantly puts it?\n\nThis film's a sampling of the Tarantino 'fury,' short of the Tarantino customary fiery tongue. It celebrates the Tarantino trademark of avoiding the use of computer-generated CGI special effects. It's almost as if I'm watching a colorful and bloodied kabuki stage that's displaying a stunningly massive tournament of multi-layered kung-fu and female samura sword-fighting styles to dazzle the audience. It's examining how Tarantino catalogues the great stylistic elements of his favorite 'old-school' filmmakers and transforms them into a phenomenally creative and mesmerizing film. Yep, there's a great deal of captivatingly artistic boldness in this film. Powerfully portrayed and not to be easily forgotten. Violently brutal and gloriously gory without doubt, and yet so aesthetically operatic and astoundingly artful. The music and lyrics that accompany the scenes are astounding. They set the moods so appropriately with the events.\n\n Even at 'The House Of Blue Leaves', we get to see Tarantino weaving the artistic styles of Lucio Fulci, Chang-Che, Sergio Leone, Kurosawa, Zhang Yimou and Busby Berkeley to bring the audience a stylistic exhibit of remarkable montage grandeur. The themes of betrayal and revenge come off strong. Every camera shot and scene seems to scream out, non-stop, `Kill Bill and all of Bill's DVAS members.'  My adrenaline's still flowing as I'm recalling the scenes. Tarantino has make a solid point with this film to show that martial arts scenes should stick to the artful and realistic choreographic treatment to sustain the true spiritual spirit of martial arts.

Some critics thought that the movie might have had some moments too intense or unsuited for young children. I was eight years old when I first saw this film and it never bothered me. I was surprised to find swearing in this film, but again, it didn't degrade the film because it was sparingly used and by that I mean it was only used once or twice.\n\nThe character of Stuart is very effectively brought onto the screen. The mouse is entirely computer-generated in an efficient way and the contributions of Michael J. Fox's voice work out very well. The same goes for the other animated characters. All of the live-action performances were well-done and they blended in perfectly with the CGI characters.\n\n"Stuart Little" has a good heart and it is can be a very warm little family movie for everybody to enjoy. I still enjoy it nine years after I first saw the film and I do recommend it. It's a film that will suit audience members of all ages. As long as you enjoy family films.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2000-03-15","keywords":"alley cat,cat actor,boat,boy,scene during end credits","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stuart Little","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4253417753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU1ODBiZGQtNzRkNy00ODRhLWI2ZjktMjZiZWI0YjYzOWRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU1ODBiZGQtNzRkNy00ODRhLWI2ZjktMjZiZWI0YjYzOWRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000150/","name":"Michael J.

Some critics thought that the movie might have had some moments too intense or unsuited for young children. I was eight years old when I first saw this film and it never bothered me. I was surprised to find swearing in this film, but again, it didn't degrade the film because it was sparingly used and by that I mean it was only used once or twice.\n\nThe character of Stuart is very effectively brought onto the screen. The mouse is entirely computer-generated in an efficient way and the contributions of Michael J. Fox's voice work out very well. The same goes for the other animated characters. All of the live-action performances were well-done and they blended in perfectly with the CGI characters.\n\n"Stuart Little" has a good heart and it is can be a very warm little family movie for everybody to enjoy. I still enjoy it nine years after I first saw the film and I do recommend it. It's a film that will suit audience members of all ages. As long as you enjoy family films.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2000-03-15","keywords":"alley cat,cat actor,boat,boy,scene during end credits","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stuart Little","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4253417753","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU1ODBiZGQtNzRkNy00ODRhLWI2ZjktMjZiZWI0YjYzOWRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmU1ODBiZGQtNzRkNy00ODRhLWI2ZjktMjZiZWI0YjYzOWRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000150/","name":"Michael J.

I'm sure that a lot of guys can relate to this movie as well.\n\n First of all, there are some hilarious lines in this movie that will appeal to men and women. Second, the orgasm scene in the restaurant has got to be one of the funniest scenes in movie history. And finally, the guys will be cheering on Billy Crystal, as he makes love to a LOT of women in this movie. I really enjoyed this movie, and I'm pretty sure that I am a guy (I'll check later). \n\nBilly Crystal and Meg Ryan will remind everyone of their everyday lives in this true-to-life (and very funny) movie. So guys, don't reject "When Harry Met Sally..." just because women cried at it. And girls, if you see this movie, you will probably want to see it another 50 times.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206277,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1989-07-21","keywords":"male female friendship,opposites attract,fake orgasm,new york,pessimist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi129743385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjYyZjk1ZDMtMGJmZC00YmI0LWJhYTYtYzA1MDcyN2JhOTU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjYyZjk1ZDMtMGJmZC00YmI0LWJhYTYtYzA1MDcyN2JhOTU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000345/","name":"Billy Crystal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000212/","name":"Meg Ryan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000402/","name":"Carrie Fisher"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001661/","name":"Rob Reiner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020346/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020346/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001188/","name":"Nora Ephron"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After all, Charlie Brown and the rest of the characters created by Charles Schulz have been huge business for decades, and it makes sense that they would put something together if for no other reason than to keep the characters active in pop culture.\n\nThankfully, it appears that the people behind "The Peanuts Movie" take the legacy of these characters very seriously, and the result is a gentle, charming movie that seems far less frantic than much of what is created for young audiences these days. Blue Sky, one of the two major producers of CG animated films for Fox, has produced ten feature films now, and while the majority of their efforts have been originals, it was clear from "Horton Hears A Who" that when they adapt someone else's property, they try to do so from a position of authenticity and respect.\n\nOne of the things that makes "Peanuts" such a broad target is all the different versions there have been. Even in our editorial meetings at HitFix, as we talk about the films or the specials that we think of when "Peanuts" is mentioned, we all have our own take on what that means. For me, the old school TV specials and the first few movies were the defining version. Louis Virtel told me he always thinks of "Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown!" first. My kids have been exposed to some of the specials, but Toshi took it upon himself to read the Fantagraphics collections of all of the strips that I have on my shelves. And to any of those people, I would say, "You'll recognize the 'Peanuts' you love in this movie, and you'll be happy." That could not have been an easy task, so for that alone, Blue Sky and Fox deserve some accolades.\n\nOne of the most interesting choices they made in approaching the movie was how to design the characters. They are 3D CG objects, but the faces are "drawn" onto the heads in a way that always feels like there's a physical brush stroke, a pencil mark. I assume the entire thing is CG, but it connects the characters to the long hand-made tradition that started with the comic strip itself. It's a strong stylistic decision, and it makes sure the characters feel like the characters we already know. Steve Martino, working from a script by Bryan Schulz, Craig Schulz, and Cornelius Uliano, touches on any number of familiar jokes and scenes and set-ups, with a number of references to the long history of the characters. Snoopy spends most of the movie working on a book on his newly-discovered typewriter, the story of a flying ace and his battle against the infamous Red Baron. Sally's got her crush on her sweet baboo, Linus, who nurses his faith in the the Great Pumpkin. Lucy gives advice at her sidewalk psychiatric stand while making passes as Schroeder every chance she gets. Peppermint Patty and her assistant Marcie both play their familiar roles as well, with Charlie Brown at the center of everything, constantly put upon, constantly taking one on the chin. If this is going to be true to the original strip that Schulz created, then Charlie Brown has got to be suffering, a kid who can't catch a break.\n\nWhat surprised me was the way they took a quiet approach to finding something else to say about Charlie Brown. I was worried that this was going to be a film where they had to turn him into something he wasn't just to tick some demographic checklist, and instead, the film makes some very strong and interesting points about what is heroic when you're just a kid trying to define yourself. In this case, there's a new kid in school, the Little Red-Haired Girl, and Charlie Brown is determined to reinvent himself in a way that will win this girl's attention and approval. This being Charlie Brown, things are not that easy, but I thought the way they eventually bring it together was unexpectedly honest. At this point, these characters have been playing the same beats for so long that it is genuinely surprising to see them do something new that doesn't feel like a violation of the characters, but rather a natural extension of what we already know about them.\n\nThe cast of young voice actors all seem appropriately chosen, and it's interesting to hear how they've gone out of their way to find kids who naturally sound like the voices that have been connected to the characters for over 40 years now. One of the reasons I don't ever want a "Calvin &amp; Hobbes" adaptation to happen is because I don't want to hear anyone else's take on how Hobbes should sound, but with these characters, they've had the same voices for so long now that it's kind of like a magic trick. It's a cast of real kids here, but they sound like the "real" Charlie Brown, the "real" Lucy, the "real" Linus.\n\nFrequently very funny, undeniably aimed at younger audiences, and true to the source material, "The Peanuts Movie" is too mild-mannered to win over brand new audiences, but it's going to please people who were already fond of the underlying property, and it should be a big nostalgia-driven hit for the studio.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44133,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-12-31","keywords":"peanuts,popularity,school,imagination,beagle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1443476249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4MzI2NTMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzMTk4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4MzI2NTMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzMTk4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Snoopy embarks upon his greatest mission as he and his team take to the skies to pursue their arch-nemesis, while his best pal Charlie Brown begins his own epic quest back home."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6907855/","name":"Noah Schnapp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006837/","name":"Bill Melendez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5295511/","name":"Hadley Belle Miller"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0553942/","name":"Steve Martino"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179259/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047265/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776441/","name":"Craig Schulz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2421049/","name":"Bryan Schulz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2370700/","name":"Cornelius Uliano"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Blue Sky, one of the two major producers of CG animated films for Fox, has produced ten feature films now, and while the majority of their efforts have been originals, it was clear from "Horton Hears A Who" that when they adapt someone else's property, they try to do so from a position of authenticity and respect.\n\nOne of the things that makes "Peanuts" such a broad target is all the different versions there have been. Even in our editorial meetings at HitFix, as we talk about the films or the specials that we think of when "Peanuts" is mentioned, we all have our own take on what that means. For me, the old school TV specials and the first few movies were the defining version. Louis Virtel told me he always thinks of "Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown!" first. My kids have been exposed to some of the specials, but Toshi took it upon himself to read the Fantagraphics collections of all of the strips that I have on my shelves. And to any of those people, I would say, "You'll recognize the 'Peanuts' you love in this movie, and you'll be happy." That could not have been an easy task, so for that alone, Blue Sky and Fox deserve some accolades.\n\nOne of the most interesting choices they made in approaching the movie was how to design the characters. They are 3D CG objects, but the faces are "drawn" onto the heads in a way that always feels like there's a physical brush stroke, a pencil mark. I assume the entire thing is CG, but it connects the characters to the long hand-made tradition that started with the comic strip itself. It's a strong stylistic decision, and it makes sure the characters feel like the characters we already know. Steve Martino, working from a script by Bryan Schulz, Craig Schulz, and Cornelius Uliano, touches on any number of familiar jokes and scenes and set-ups, with a number of references to the long history of the characters. Snoopy spends most of the movie working on a book on his newly-discovered typewriter, the story of a flying ace and his battle against the infamous Red Baron. Sally's got her crush on her sweet baboo, Linus, who nurses his faith in the the Great Pumpkin. Lucy gives advice at her sidewalk psychiatric stand while making passes as Schroeder every chance she gets. Peppermint Patty and her assistant Marcie both play their familiar roles as well, with Charlie Brown at the center of everything, constantly put upon, constantly taking one on the chin. If this is going to be true to the original strip that Schulz created, then Charlie Brown has got to be suffering, a kid who can't catch a break.\n\nWhat surprised me was the way they took a quiet approach to finding something else to say about Charlie Brown. I was worried that this was going to be a film where they had to turn him into something he wasn't just to tick some demographic checklist, and instead, the film makes some very strong and interesting points about what is heroic when you're just a kid trying to define yourself. In this case, there's a new kid in school, the Little Red-Haired Girl, and Charlie Brown is determined to reinvent himself in a way that will win this girl's attention and approval. This being Charlie Brown, things are not that easy, but I thought the way they eventually bring it together was unexpectedly honest. At this point, these characters have been playing the same beats for so long that it is genuinely surprising to see them do something new that doesn't feel like a violation of the characters, but rather a natural extension of what we already know about them.\n\nThe cast of young voice actors all seem appropriately chosen, and it's interesting to hear how they've gone out of their way to find kids who naturally sound like the voices that have been connected to the characters for over 40 years now. One of the reasons I don't ever want a "Calvin &amp; Hobbes" adaptation to happen is because I don't want to hear anyone else's take on how Hobbes should sound, but with these characters, they've had the same voices for so long now that it's kind of like a magic trick. It's a cast of real kids here, but they sound like the "real" Charlie Brown, the "real" Lucy, the "real" Linus.\n\nFrequently very funny, undeniably aimed at younger audiences, and true to the source material, "The Peanuts Movie" is too mild-mannered to win over brand new audiences, but it's going to please people who were already fond of the underlying property, and it should be a big nostalgia-driven hit for the studio.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44133,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-12-31","keywords":"peanuts,popularity,school,imagination,beagle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1443476249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4MzI2NTMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzMTk4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4MzI2NTMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzMTk4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Snoopy embarks upon his greatest mission as he and his team take to the skies to pursue their arch-nemesis, while his best pal Charlie Brown begins his own epic quest back home.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6907855/","name":"Noah Schnapp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006837/","name":"Bill Melendez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5295511/","name":"Hadley Belle Miller"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0553942/","name":"Steve Martino"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179259/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047265/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776441/","name":"Craig Schulz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2421049/","name":"Bryan Schulz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2370700/","name":"Cornelius Uliano"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Superb Animation","reviewBody":"It's October and it is usually the time for Halloween themed movies. Unfortunately for us, Halloween has been reduced to cheap horrors, or repetitive thrillers that are a bit of a bore. This year has been slightly different, but this reviewer would like the studios to go back in the past and pull some more seasonal themes to entertain us. Well, someone got my vibe, because my last review is on a film that captures the festive fun that Halloween is for the young and young at heart. So sit back my friends and catch my latest review on the animated feature The Book of Life. \n\nI'll start this review with talking about the story. The Book of Life has a fantastic tale that centers on the typical complication of a love triangle between characters Manolo (Diego Luna), Maria (Zoe Saldana), and Joaquin (Channing Tatum). Now we know the typical elements involved in this type of plot, but this film deviates from the typical and gives a little more pep around the story. From the start you get the backstory on each character, and the individual struggles they each face. Then they take these qualities and exploit them by bringing in the two masters of the underworld, who make a wager as to who will win the girl. The result of this wager, makes for an interesting romantic tale that is fun, emotional, and more realistic than half the dramas we get these days. However, the movie does not stop there, instead it ties in an adventure and blends it into all the aspects, making for a fun film. Once more, the whole tale revolves around the Mexican celebration of the day of the dead, bringing a unique take on the classic Halloween tale and providing a little education as well. \n\nThe story isn't the only thing influenced by the Mexican culture though, the artistic style of the movie is also heavily influenced. The Book of Life is sort of a modern day Nightmare Before Christmas where CGI takes the place of stop motion animation. Many of the elements are similar, with the skeletons and landscapes sharp and angular to mirror the darkness of the afterlife. However, unlike Tim Burton, this director chose to liven things up a little by veering from the dark colors and adding wide splashes of colorful. This is not only to catch your eyes, but also to mirror the celebration that Day of the Dead is about and that life doesn't end as long as you are remembered. In the Underworld especially the color comes out, and the festivities are brought to full fold in the magical realm of the dead. Deep in the land of the Forgotten, the oblivion of elimination is presented by a frozen cavern where hope is nonexistent. Regardless, the worlds are diverse and fun, filled with ancient Central American influences that were a welcomed change. Even the characters have pizazz to them, each main character standing out in their own unique way. I in particular liked the Queen of the underworld, impressed with the blend of partying, happy, and death all wrapped into one package. The ruler of the Forgotten Land, was also of unique design, sharp, dark edges in shades of purple, neon green, and crimson to portray the darkness of his soul. \n\nWhat else makes this movie fun? The next aspect is the comedy, which for the most part is well timed and well delivered. There isn't much unique writing or witty humor in this movie, but more in how it is delivered. Countless puns are shouted in ridiculous voices, often followed by a character face planting into an object. What's even better is that the comedy is also diverse and spread out instead of following the typical style of beating a joke to death, the exception being Joaquin's obsession with mustaches. In addition to the comedy, the music also brings some thing to the film. Most of the numbers are covers of famous songs, some done horribly to be funny and others that are very relevant to the plot. A couple of the original numbers made my emotions go on a ride, as happiness, sadness, and even love all came together in the instruments and voice. Now most won't find it as powerful as Frozen, but for this reviewer it was nice having the music around the movie, not the opposite way around. Aside from the singing, the voice acting is incredible, each of the cast capturing the essence of the stereotypical Mexican character. Now there are too many to write about so let me pick my three favorites. First is Christina Applegate, the girl has got sass, spunk, and compassion all at work in her tour guide character. The girls sells the story as she uses the wooden puppets, which are represented in the character design, to craft the tale, keeping the kids in line, and yet showing empathy. Then there was Zoe Saldana who has the feisty Mexican girl zest that shows everyone girls don't need men to save them. Her voice is suave and full of passion, and exactly the buffer needed amidst the rowdy, rough voices of the cast. Finally the Queen of the Dead was my favorite character, and Kate del Castillo does a nice job bringing the character to life with flare, kindness, and the ability to hold her own. \n\nWhat can you take away from my sporadic rambling? The Book of Life is one of the better animated films I've seen in a while. It's Halloween fun, with colorful worlds and characters that balance out the predictable and limited tale. I strongly recommend seeing this movie in theaters, possibly in 3-D. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in quite some time, and I believe most will enjoy the adventure at hand. My scores for this film are: \n\nAnimation/Adventure/Comedy: 9.5 Movie Overall: 9.0","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67676,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-10-15","keywords":"afterlife,mexico,death character,bullfight,serenade","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi840674329","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Manolo, a young man who is torn between fulfilling the expectations of his family and following his heart, embarks on an adventure that spans three fantastical worlds where he must face his greatest fears.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0526019/","name":"Diego Luna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757855/","name":"Zoe Saldana"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1509613/","name":"Jorge R.

However, the movie does not stop there, instead it ties in an adventure and blends it into all the aspects, making for a fun film. Once more, the whole tale revolves around the Mexican celebration of the day of the dead, bringing a unique take on the classic Halloween tale and providing a little education as well. \n\nThe story isn't the only thing influenced by the Mexican culture though, the artistic style of the movie is also heavily influenced. The Book of Life is sort of a modern day Nightmare Before Christmas where CGI takes the place of stop motion animation. Many of the elements are similar, with the skeletons and landscapes sharp and angular to mirror the darkness of the afterlife. However, unlike Tim Burton, this director chose to liven things up a little by veering from the dark colors and adding wide splashes of colorful. This is not only to catch your eyes, but also to mirror the celebration that Day of the Dead is about and that life doesn't end as long as you are remembered. In the Underworld especially the color comes out, and the festivities are brought to full fold in the magical realm of the dead. Deep in the land of the Forgotten, the oblivion of elimination is presented by a frozen cavern where hope is nonexistent. Regardless, the worlds are diverse and fun, filled with ancient Central American influences that were a welcomed change. Even the characters have pizazz to them, each main character standing out in their own unique way. I in particular liked the Queen of the underworld, impressed with the blend of partying, happy, and death all wrapped into one package. The ruler of the Forgotten Land, was also of unique design, sharp, dark edges in shades of purple, neon green, and crimson to portray the darkness of his soul. \n\nWhat else makes this movie fun? The next aspect is the comedy, which for the most part is well timed and well delivered. There isn't much unique writing or witty humor in this movie, but more in how it is delivered. Countless puns are shouted in ridiculous voices, often followed by a character face planting into an object. What's even better is that the comedy is also diverse and spread out instead of following the typical style of beating a joke to death, the exception being Joaquin's obsession with mustaches. In addition to the comedy, the music also brings some thing to the film. Most of the numbers are covers of famous songs, some done horribly to be funny and others that are very relevant to the plot. A couple of the original numbers made my emotions go on a ride, as happiness, sadness, and even love all came together in the instruments and voice. Now most won't find it as powerful as Frozen, but for this reviewer it was nice having the music around the movie, not the opposite way around. Aside from the singing, the voice acting is incredible, each of the cast capturing the essence of the stereotypical Mexican character. Now there are too many to write about so let me pick my three favorites. First is Christina Applegate, the girl has got sass, spunk, and compassion all at work in her tour guide character. The girls sells the story as she uses the wooden puppets, which are represented in the character design, to craft the tale, keeping the kids in line, and yet showing empathy. Then there was Zoe Saldana who has the feisty Mexican girl zest that shows everyone girls don't need men to save them. Her voice is suave and full of passion, and exactly the buffer needed amidst the rowdy, rough voices of the cast. Finally the Queen of the Dead was my favorite character, and Kate del Castillo does a nice job bringing the character to life with flare, kindness, and the ability to hold her own. \n\nWhat can you take away from my sporadic rambling? The Book of Life is one of the better animated films I've seen in a while. It's Halloween fun, with colorful worlds and characters that balance out the predictable and limited tale. I strongly recommend seeing this movie in theaters, possibly in 3-D. I haven't had this much fun at the movies in quite some time, and I believe most will enjoy the adventure at hand. My scores for this film are: \n\nAnimation/Adventure/Comedy: 9.5 Movie Overall: 9.0","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67676,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-10-15","keywords":"afterlife,mexico,death character,bullfight,serenade","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi840674329","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Manolo, a young man who is torn between fulfilling the expectations of his family and following his heart, embarks on an adventure that spans three fantastical worlds where he must face his greatest fears.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0526019/","name":"Diego Luna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757855/","name":"Zoe Saldana","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1509613/","name":"Jorge R.

After all, Charlie Brown and the rest of the characters created by Charles Schulz have been huge business for decades, and it makes sense that they would put something together if for no other reason than to keep the characters active in pop culture.\n\nThankfully, it appears that the people behind "The Peanuts Movie" take the legacy of these characters very seriously, and the result is a gentle, charming movie that seems far less frantic than much of what is created for young audiences these days. Blue Sky, one of the two major producers of CG animated films for Fox, has produced ten feature films now, and while the majority of their efforts have been originals, it was clear from "Horton Hears A Who" that when they adapt someone else's property, they try to do so from a position of authenticity and respect.\n\nOne of the things that makes "Peanuts" such a broad target is all the different versions there have been. Even in our editorial meetings at HitFix, as we talk about the films or the specials that we think of when "Peanuts" is mentioned, we all have our own take on what that means. For me, the old school TV specials and the first few movies were the defining version. Louis Virtel told me he always thinks of "Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown!" first. My kids have been exposed to some of the specials, but Toshi took it upon himself to read the Fantagraphics collections of all of the strips that I have on my shelves. And to any of those people, I would say, "You'll recognize the 'Peanuts' you love in this movie, and you'll be happy." That could not have been an easy task, so for that alone, Blue Sky and Fox deserve some accolades.\n\nOne of the most interesting choices they made in approaching the movie was how to design the characters. They are 3D CG objects, but the faces are "drawn" onto the heads in a way that always feels like there's a physical brush stroke, a pencil mark. I assume the entire thing is CG, but it connects the characters to the long hand-made tradition that started with the comic strip itself. It's a strong stylistic decision, and it makes sure the characters feel like the characters we already know. Steve Martino, working from a script by Bryan Schulz, Craig Schulz, and Cornelius Uliano, touches on any number of familiar jokes and scenes and set-ups, with a number of references to the long history of the characters. Snoopy spends most of the movie working on a book on his newly-discovered typewriter, the story of a flying ace and his battle against the infamous Red Baron. Sally's got her crush on her sweet baboo, Linus, who nurses his faith in the the Great Pumpkin. Lucy gives advice at her sidewalk psychiatric stand while making passes as Schroeder every chance she gets. Peppermint Patty and her assistant Marcie both play their familiar roles as well, with Charlie Brown at the center of everything, constantly put upon, constantly taking one on the chin. If this is going to be true to the original strip that Schulz created, then Charlie Brown has got to be suffering, a kid who can't catch a break.\n\nWhat surprised me was the way they took a quiet approach to finding something else to say about Charlie Brown. I was worried that this was going to be a film where they had to turn him into something he wasn't just to tick some demographic checklist, and instead, the film makes some very strong and interesting points about what is heroic when you're just a kid trying to define yourself. In this case, there's a new kid in school, the Little Red-Haired Girl, and Charlie Brown is determined to reinvent himself in a way that will win this girl's attention and approval. This being Charlie Brown, things are not that easy, but I thought the way they eventually bring it together was unexpectedly honest. At this point, these characters have been playing the same beats for so long that it is genuinely surprising to see them do something new that doesn't feel like a violation of the characters, but rather a natural extension of what we already know about them.\n\nThe cast of young voice actors all seem appropriately chosen, and it's interesting to hear how they've gone out of their way to find kids who naturally sound like the voices that have been connected to the characters for over 40 years now. One of the reasons I don't ever want a "Calvin &amp; Hobbes" adaptation to happen is because I don't want to hear anyone else's take on how Hobbes should sound, but with these characters, they've had the same voices for so long now that it's kind of like a magic trick. It's a cast of real kids here, but they sound like the "real" Charlie Brown, the "real" Lucy, the "real" Linus.\n\nFrequently very funny, undeniably aimed at younger audiences, and true to the source material, "The Peanuts Movie" is too mild-mannered to win over brand new audiences, but it's going to please people who were already fond of the underlying property, and it should be a big nostalgia-driven hit for the studio.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44133,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-12-31","keywords":"peanuts,popularity,school,imagination,beagle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1443476249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4MzI2NTMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzMTk4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4MzI2NTMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzMTk4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Snoopy embarks upon his greatest mission as he and his team take to the skies to pursue their arch-nemesis, while his best pal Charlie Brown begins his own epic quest back home."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6907855/","name":"Noah Schnapp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006837/","name":"Bill Melendez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5295511/","name":"Hadley Belle Miller"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0553942/","name":"Steve Martino"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179259/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047265/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776441/","name":"Craig Schulz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2421049/","name":"Bryan Schulz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2370700/","name":"Cornelius Uliano"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Blue Sky, one of the two major producers of CG animated films for Fox, has produced ten feature films now, and while the majority of their efforts have been originals, it was clear from "Horton Hears A Who" that when they adapt someone else's property, they try to do so from a position of authenticity and respect.\n\nOne of the things that makes "Peanuts" such a broad target is all the different versions there have been. Even in our editorial meetings at HitFix, as we talk about the films or the specials that we think of when "Peanuts" is mentioned, we all have our own take on what that means. For me, the old school TV specials and the first few movies were the defining version. Louis Virtel told me he always thinks of "Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown!" first. My kids have been exposed to some of the specials, but Toshi took it upon himself to read the Fantagraphics collections of all of the strips that I have on my shelves. And to any of those people, I would say, "You'll recognize the 'Peanuts' you love in this movie, and you'll be happy." That could not have been an easy task, so for that alone, Blue Sky and Fox deserve some accolades.\n\nOne of the most interesting choices they made in approaching the movie was how to design the characters. They are 3D CG objects, but the faces are "drawn" onto the heads in a way that always feels like there's a physical brush stroke, a pencil mark. I assume the entire thing is CG, but it connects the characters to the long hand-made tradition that started with the comic strip itself. It's a strong stylistic decision, and it makes sure the characters feel like the characters we already know. Steve Martino, working from a script by Bryan Schulz, Craig Schulz, and Cornelius Uliano, touches on any number of familiar jokes and scenes and set-ups, with a number of references to the long history of the characters. Snoopy spends most of the movie working on a book on his newly-discovered typewriter, the story of a flying ace and his battle against the infamous Red Baron. Sally's got her crush on her sweet baboo, Linus, who nurses his faith in the the Great Pumpkin. Lucy gives advice at her sidewalk psychiatric stand while making passes as Schroeder every chance she gets. Peppermint Patty and her assistant Marcie both play their familiar roles as well, with Charlie Brown at the center of everything, constantly put upon, constantly taking one on the chin. If this is going to be true to the original strip that Schulz created, then Charlie Brown has got to be suffering, a kid who can't catch a break.\n\nWhat surprised me was the way they took a quiet approach to finding something else to say about Charlie Brown. I was worried that this was going to be a film where they had to turn him into something he wasn't just to tick some demographic checklist, and instead, the film makes some very strong and interesting points about what is heroic when you're just a kid trying to define yourself. In this case, there's a new kid in school, the Little Red-Haired Girl, and Charlie Brown is determined to reinvent himself in a way that will win this girl's attention and approval. This being Charlie Brown, things are not that easy, but I thought the way they eventually bring it together was unexpectedly honest. At this point, these characters have been playing the same beats for so long that it is genuinely surprising to see them do something new that doesn't feel like a violation of the characters, but rather a natural extension of what we already know about them.\n\nThe cast of young voice actors all seem appropriately chosen, and it's interesting to hear how they've gone out of their way to find kids who naturally sound like the voices that have been connected to the characters for over 40 years now. One of the reasons I don't ever want a "Calvin &amp; Hobbes" adaptation to happen is because I don't want to hear anyone else's take on how Hobbes should sound, but with these characters, they've had the same voices for so long now that it's kind of like a magic trick. It's a cast of real kids here, but they sound like the "real" Charlie Brown, the "real" Lucy, the "real" Linus.\n\nFrequently very funny, undeniably aimed at younger audiences, and true to the source material, "The Peanuts Movie" is too mild-mannered to win over brand new audiences, but it's going to please people who were already fond of the underlying property, and it should be a big nostalgia-driven hit for the studio.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44133,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-12-31","keywords":"peanuts,popularity,school,imagination,beagle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1443476249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4MzI2NTMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzMTk4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4MzI2NTMxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzMTk4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Snoopy embarks upon his greatest mission as he and his team take to the skies to pursue their arch-nemesis, while his best pal Charlie Brown begins his own epic quest back home.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6907855/","name":"Noah Schnapp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006837/","name":"Bill Melendez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5295511/","name":"Hadley Belle Miller"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0553942/","name":"Steve Martino"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179259/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047265/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776441/","name":"Craig Schulz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2421049/","name":"Bryan Schulz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2370700/","name":"Cornelius Uliano"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They both have great redeeming qualities that pretty much balance the scale.\n\nThe two films movie at a similar rhythm.  In the original, we opened with Jim's Dad walking in on him while masturbating.  In the sequel, he walks in on him while he's having sex, only it's taken to the next level with the girlfriend's parents walking in as well.  And we have the keg party, with a Steadicam shot following Stiffler around, who yet again gets into a mishap with bodily fluids.

I do have to say, Stiffler's character got a little too obnoxious at times. It's often funny to hear his foul-mouthed insults, but by the hundredth time you hear him use the word "f**kface" it gets kinda old.\n\n I'm always going to hold the "American Pie" movies several notches above the standard gross-out teen comedies, because they have zest and originality. Not to mention they're done in a professional manner.  The gags are as intelligent as they are crude, and delivered with exquisite timing.  And to top it off, it's a heartfelt film that is not literally all about getting laid.  I thought the original had more heart to it, but the sequel also has its heart in the right place.\n\nThe music is great.  The soundtrack is full of really cool songs, including "Smooth Criminal" by Alien Ant Farm.  And be sure to check out the unrated DVD special edition.  The commentary is cool and--unlike with the first "American Pie" unrated edition--there is some bonus footage worth checking out.  The lesbian scene is extended significantly.

In the theatrical version, there was only a brief nudity, but you get to see much more in this version.\n\nI'm still not sure if I would consider this movie better than the first, but it is one sequel that lives up to the original--and that's saying a lot!\n\nMy score:  7 (out of 10)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":247435,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-08-10","keywords":"coitus,female nudity,college student,reference to safe sex,female removes her clothes","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"American Pie 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4043966233","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJlNzYzY2YtOWM5MS00M2U1LWE4OTItZTQwYjVkNDY0MWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJlNzYzY2YtOWM5MS00M2U1LWE4OTItZTQwYjVkNDY0MWUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Teaser trailer for this comedy follow up","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004755/","name":"Jason Biggs","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005405/","name":"Seann William Scott","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002436/","name":"Shannon Elizabeth"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736930/","name":"J.B.

Most stars check in as if paying back some favour to the director. It is a people movie full of people for the Facebook generation. Is it serious film-making? Well, it's one of those films that has bloopers during the credits, so definitely not; so we shouldn't judge it on that. It's simply a schmaltzy whimsical chick flick. The film takes place over one fine Valentine's Day from early morning to late at night in flawless Hollywood California. We follow random individuals, who are each connected within 5 degrees of each other, as they deal with love. The movie has been marketed as being choc-block full of superstars, so lets see how they did. Kathy Bates has two scenes, I completely forgot she was in it until the second time she popped up, She is very likable as the butch TV News executive who is the boss of career driven Kelvin Moore (Jamie Foxx), a B-Grade sports commentator trying to make his mark, but given a vox-pops job. Foxx seems way too charming to be such an unlikeable character, as publicist Kara (Jessica Biel) slowly falls for him, but we're not really given enough time as we cut to florist Reed (Ashton Kutcher) a hopeless romantic who has fallen for Morley (Jessica Alba), and Julia (Jennifer Garner) in a 30-something love triangle. Garner is a teacher at a primary school where young Edison (Bryce Robinson) has his first crush, and desperately tries to send his mystery girl a special delivery. Robinson brings the cute to this movie, and holds his own against the army of celebrities he's acting with, namely Shirley MacLaine as Edison's grandmother, Estelle. Estelle is a Golden Age Actress, (MacLaine playing herself, as we see from actual footage of MacLaine in 1958's Hot Spell) who is in a fifty year marriage with Edgar (Hector Elizondo). Both performances are top notch, Elizondo arguably the best in the entire film. He is soulful, gentle, and wise. For the teens, the majority market, we have Grace and Alex (Emma Roberts and Carter Jenkins) awkwardly trying to plan the next level of their relationship in scenes right out of the American Pie book on how to write teen comedy, and Willy and Felicia (Taylor Lautner and Taylor Swift) the jock and the bimbo, who 13 to 19 year old girls will literally cheer at the screen for, yet they bring little. Swift is cringe-worthy and Lautner makes an out of place reference to his abs that is just odd in the context of the film. We also have Liz (Anne Hathaway in a solid enough comedic performance, she does funny voices) who moonlights as a phone sex operator, and hides this from boyfriend of two weeks Jason (Topher Grace, slighty less annoying than usual). Also thrown into the mix is McDreamy as the cheating swine Dr. Harrison Copeland, and McSteamy as ageing single footballer Sean Jackson. Stuck on a plane are Holden and Captain Kate Hazeltine (Bradley Cooper, and Julia Roberts), as they meet, and chat, and flirt, and seem like those two old grumpy muppets in the booth. Queen Latifah also features as Liz's evil boss Paula Thomas who delivers the biggest laugh in the movie, right at the end. Alphonso (George Lopez) also stars as Kutcher's co-worker and go-to-guy for the Valentine's Day blues. Every actor does a good enough job of playing movie versions of themselves and no one tries to steal the show or go over the top crazy, but the amount of stars in the movie work both for it and against it. It is a very unique romance film, and is good for people who are likely to get sick of the same two actors, but we really don't see enough of anyone to care, or even follow what's going on. Characters are thrown at us, and before we have a moment to connect, we cut to someone else, and this happens for two straight hours as love, romance, sex, and relationships are examined and theorized. It's like a fish bowl with way too many fish, but we get to see characters just enough to get a laugh or two in. The film tries to find the true meaning of Valentine's Day, and the true meaning of love, in a cutesy comedic way. It's modern and fun, but very shallow on the surface.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116859,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-02-10","keywords":"grandmother grandson relationship,grandfather grandson relationship,car,barefoot male,man wrapped in a towel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Valentine's Day -- International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2244215833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NTY5NzEyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3ODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4NTY5NzEyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3ODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Intertwining couples and singles in Los Angeles break-up and make-up based on the pressures and expectations of Valentine's Day."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005190/","name":"Garry Marshall"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176486/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033868/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0297545/","name":"Katherine Fugate"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0463359/","name":"Abby Kohn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799050/","name":"Marc Silverstein"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A physician (Penelope Cruz ) is investigating about an illness which is killing thousands people . Then they 'll take on ominous villains,evil Arabs,corrupt governments and many dangers until discover the enigmas. \n\nThe motion picture blends adventures, unstopped action,humor,a love story,tongue in cheek,tense and is enough amusing. From the beginning to end the adventures,action-packed and the fast movement is continuous, for that the film is pretty bemusing and isn't boring in spite of the longtime, as the run is two hours and some. The starring couple(Matthew MacConaughey and Steve Zahn) make a type of ¨buddy movie¨ both are top notch and very sympathetic.Penelope Cruz is attractive and enjoyable, this is her best film. The support cast is of first range (William H.Macy,Lambert Wilson,Delroy Lindo) and are excellent. Cinematography and musical score(Clint Mansell) is magnificent and riveting. Production design (Allan Cameron) is spellbound and the Sahara outdoors are spectaculars. The final confrontation between the starring and the enemies is breathtaking and impressive. It's a run and mill action film where the comedy and the giggles united to the action make the story very agreeable and stimulating. The picture well directed by Brick Eisner obtained a lot of success and achieved important box office, it was number one in United States and Europe. It's a real blockbuster. The yarn will appeal to emotion and adventure enthusiasts . Rating: Above average.

A physician (Penelope Cruz ) is investigating about an illness which is killing thousands people . Then they 'll take on ominous villains,evil Arabs,corrupt governments and many dangers until discover the enigmas. \n\nThe motion picture blends adventures, unstopped action,humor,a love story,tongue in cheek,tense and is enough amusing. From the beginning to end the adventures,action-packed and the fast movement is continuous, for that the film is pretty bemusing and isn't boring in spite of the longtime, as the run is two hours and some. The starring couple(Matthew MacConaughey and Steve Zahn) make a type of ¨buddy movie¨ both are top notch and very sympathetic.Penelope Cruz is attractive and enjoyable, this is her best film. The support cast is of first range (William H.Macy,Lambert Wilson,Delroy Lindo) and are excellent. Cinematography and musical score(Clint Mansell) is magnificent and riveting. Production design (Allan Cameron) is spellbound and the Sahara outdoors are spectaculars. The final confrontation between the starring and the enemies is breathtaking and impressive. It's a run and mill action film where the comedy and the giggles united to the action make the story very agreeable and stimulating. The picture well directed by Brick Eisner obtained a lot of success and achieved important box office, it was number one in United States and Europe. It's a real blockbuster. The yarn will appeal to emotion and adventure enthusiasts . Rating: Above average. Well worth seeing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95550,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2005-04-20","keywords":"beach,evil man,good versus evil,bare chested male,disguise","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sahara","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2089091353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDdlYjVlYjAtZTc2Ny00NzJjLWFlYjUtM2YyZjY3MjYyNGIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDdlYjVlYjAtZTc2Ny00NzJjLWFlYjUtM2YyZjY3MjYyNGIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000190/","name":"Matthew McConaughey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004851/","name":"Penélope Cruz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001872/","name":"Steve Zahn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0252135/","name":"Breck Eisner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129170/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0145519/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193774/","name":"Clive Cussler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0232776/","name":"Thomas Dean Donnelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0649191/","name":"Joshua Oppenheimer"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Warren Schmidt has a handicap, but it's the same handicap most of the people standing on line at seven p.m. at your local Wendy's have. The real star (or anti-star) of About Schmidt is the mediocre architectural landscape of America. Every room or box Warren Schmidt enters in this movie is as devoid of caring and vitality as he is: the retirement banquet room, Warren's house, the tire store, the hired wedding reception room. Schmidt's director and production designer take care to place us in the same life-draining, cheap structures we inhabit and deal with everyday. No prettifying. This is the drab landscape of Fargo revisited, but without the irony. The steady doses of violence in Fargo allowed you an escape route. But there's nothing ironical about a wasted life and a 66 year old widower spinning his wheels in the same rut, now partnerless and foundering. The combination of Jack, this story and these settings is effective and compelling. The result would be, I think, inevitable. The tone and attitude is not consistently managed, even by Nicholsen, whose worn-out, mannered schtick pops up occasionally. Yet the final effect is impossible to fend off: mundane American hell with droll comedic diversion. We experience a downfall as poignant as the smell of bacon cooking in Denny's at eight a.m.\n\nLike Forrest Gump, the film depends on extensive voice over narration, V.O'd by Nicholsen as letters to Schmidt's newly adopted six year old Tanzanian foster child. Through these ridiculous sharings of sextagenarian angst with an African boy, we register Schmidt's internal grievances - thoughts we would never know about otherwise without his commentary.  The slow dragging score drains vitality from each transition, as if cinematic momentum would be antithetical to the point of the tale. Back and forth we rock from a single minor chord to a second one, getting nowhere. The mood, the landscape, the buildings, the people say it all:  Schmidt's on the road, but he might as well be sitting home in his lay-z-boy.  The cushy bucket seat of a 35 foot Winnebago makes a good substitute.\n\nCasting Jack Nicholson may have been the only way this story could have come to the screen. I've racked my brain to think of one other actor who could have pulled Schmidt off. Tony Hopkins? Not with the same comedic finesse. Gene Hackman reprising his role in Coppola's The Conversation or doing his Tennenbaum hamming? Don't think so. Only Jack has the mix. He does some hilarious bits in this, but overall the mood is somber, glum, inert. Can this be how that other famous Warren from Nebransas - Mr. Buffet - lives?\n\nI was confused, amused, depressed and wierdly disoriented by About Schmidt as I left the theater. I commented that it wasn't a film I'd go see again. Thinking about it a day later, I'd hold to that IF it meant returning to the theater and paying.

 --- Description: About Schmidt: Directed by Alexander Payne. With Jack Nicholson, Kathy Bates, Hope Davis, Dermot Mulroney. A recently retired man embarks on a journey to his estranged daughter's wedding, only to discover more about himself and life than he ever expected." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0257360/","name":"About Schmidt","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDgxYzgyMGUtYTkxYS00Yzk5LWIwMmItNGIzY2I5ZTE3MmNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjk1Njg5NTA@._V1_.jpg","description":"A recently retired man embarks on a journey to his estranged daughter's wedding, only to discover more about himself and life than he ever expected.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0257360/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"intuitive7","dateCreated":"2003-01-09","inLanguage":"English","name":"Forrest Gump Meets the Conversation","reviewBody":"About Schmidt is Forrest Gump through the lens of Sartre or Camus. Warren Schmidt has a handicap, but it's the same handicap most of the people standing on line at seven p.m. at your local Wendy's have. The real star (or anti-star) of About Schmidt is the mediocre architectural landscape of America. Every room or box Warren Schmidt enters in this movie is as devoid of caring and vitality as he is: the retirement banquet room, Warren's house, the tire store, the hired wedding reception room. Schmidt's director and production designer take care to place us in the same life-draining, cheap structures we inhabit and deal with everyday. No prettifying. This is the drab landscape of Fargo revisited, but without the irony. The steady doses of violence in Fargo allowed you an escape route. But there's nothing ironical about a wasted life and a 66 year old widower spinning his wheels in the same rut, now partnerless and foundering. The combination of Jack, this story and these settings is effective and compelling. The result would be, I think, inevitable. The tone and attitude is not consistently managed, even by Nicholsen, whose worn-out, mannered schtick pops up occasionally. Yet the final effect is impossible to fend off: mundane American hell with droll comedic diversion. We experience a downfall as poignant as the smell of bacon cooking in Denny's at eight a.m.\n\nLike Forrest Gump, the film depends on extensive voice over narration, V.O'd by Nicholsen as letters to Schmidt's newly adopted six year old Tanzanian foster child. Through these ridiculous sharings of sextagenarian angst with an African boy, we register Schmidt's internal grievances - thoughts we would never know about otherwise without his commentary.  The slow dragging score drains vitality from each transition, as if cinematic momentum would be antithetical to the point of the tale. Back and forth we rock from a single minor chord to a second one, getting nowhere. The mood, the landscape, the buildings, the people say it all:  Schmidt's on the road, but he might as well be sitting home in his lay-z-boy.  The cushy bucket seat of a 35 foot Winnebago makes a good substitute.\n\nCasting Jack Nicholson may have been the only way this story could have come to the screen. I've racked my brain to think of one other actor who could have pulled Schmidt off. Tony Hopkins? Not with the same comedic finesse. Gene Hackman reprising his role in Coppola's The Conversation or doing his Tennenbaum hamming? Don't think so. Only Jack has the mix. He does some hilarious bits in this, but overall the mood is somber, glum, inert. Can this be how that other famous Warren from Nebransas - Mr. Buffet - lives?\n\nI was confused, amused, depressed and wierdly disoriented by About Schmidt as I left the theater. I commented that it wasn't a film I'd go see again. Thinking about it a day later, I'd hold to that IF it meant returning to the theater and paying. BUT - were I to run across About Schmidt on cable, I doubt I could tear myself away from it any more than I could from a crack up at the Indy 500. And I think that chance encounter might happen more than once, maybe for years. After all, this is the America I know and mark time in myself. A recommended film going experience.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":126540,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-04-09","keywords":"minden nebraska,retirement party,recreational vehicle,omaha nebraska,female nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"About Schmidt","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3820224793","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIyMmQyMjUtOWI4Ny00NzZiLWI2NzgtZDQ0YmEzOTk1NTRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIyMmQyMjUtOWI4Ny00NzZiLWI2NzgtZDQ0YmEzOTk1NTRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from New Line Cinema","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000197/","name":"Jack Nicholson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204706/","name":"Hope Davis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000551/","name":"Dermot Mulroney"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668247/","name":"Alexander Payne"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028247/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1095201/","name":"Louis Begley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668247/","name":"Alexander Payne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852591/","name":"Jim Taylor"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The support cast is of first range (William H.Macy,Lambert Wilson,Delroy Lindo) and are excellent. Cinematography and musical score(Clint Mansell) is magnificent and riveting. Production design (Allan Cameron) is spellbound and the Sahara outdoors are spectaculars. The final confrontation between the starring and the enemies is breathtaking and impressive. It's a run and mill action film where the comedy and the giggles united to the action make the story very agreeable and stimulating. The picture well directed by Brick Eisner obtained a lot of success and achieved important box office, it was number one in United States and Europe. It's a real blockbuster.

Then they 'll take on ominous villains,evil Arabs,corrupt governments and many dangers until discover the enigmas. \n\nThe motion picture blends adventures, unstopped action,humor,a love story,tongue in cheek,tense and is enough amusing. From the beginning to end the adventures,action-packed and the fast movement is continuous, for that the film is pretty bemusing and isn't boring in spite of the longtime, as the run is two hours and some. The starring couple(Matthew MacConaughey and Steve Zahn) make a type of ¨buddy movie¨ both are top notch and very sympathetic.Penelope Cruz is attractive and enjoyable, this is her best film. The support cast is of first range (William H.Macy,Lambert Wilson,Delroy Lindo) and are excellent. Cinematography and musical score(Clint Mansell) is magnificent and riveting. Production design (Allan Cameron) is spellbound and the Sahara outdoors are spectaculars. The final confrontation between the starring and the enemies is breathtaking and impressive. It's a run and mill action film where the comedy and the giggles united to the action make the story very agreeable and stimulating. The picture well directed by Brick Eisner obtained a lot of success and achieved important box office, it was number one in United States and Europe. It's a real blockbuster. The yarn will appeal to emotion and adventure enthusiasts . Rating: Above average. Well worth seeing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95550,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2005-04-20","keywords":"beach,evil man,good versus evil,bare chested male,disguise","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sahara","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2089091353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDdlYjVlYjAtZTc2Ny00NzJjLWFlYjUtM2YyZjY3MjYyNGIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDdlYjVlYjAtZTc2Ny00NzJjLWFlYjUtM2YyZjY3MjYyNGIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000190/","name":"Matthew McConaughey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004851/","name":"Penélope Cruz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001872/","name":"Steve Zahn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0252135/","name":"Breck Eisner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129170/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0145519/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193774/","name":"Clive Cussler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0232776/","name":"Thomas Dean Donnelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0649191/","name":"Joshua Oppenheimer"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Certainly up to this point in time anyway! \n\nConnery has got himself down the gym for this one, but looks every one of his fifty plus years and then some. Thankfully the stuntmen do most of the work meaning a lot of the time he is wearing a helmet, headscarf, wet-suit or photographed from an obscure angle. Can always tell though - the stunt-man's hair moves while Connery's doesn't.\n\n(It is said that the original script included a scene where Bond puts the toupee on!) \n\nListen you know the score or you are very young indeed. Man wants to take over the world, the sexy girl (or two) comes along before they face the ticking bomb. Kim Bassinger looks fabulous with a fantastic figure, but what shocking dancer! Gets her in to a leotard (and I am not complaining), but what a baby elephant.Can't even do a 360 turn! As per usual she looks vaguely disinterested in anything and everything - but there was an Oscar in it down the road so keep going darling! \n\nThe logic of Bond is that he is sometimes very smart (knows how to operate secret equipment with no training!) and other times very stupid. Gets captured very easily, indeed doesn't seem to mind too much when he does. Usually there is a nice meal in it for him.\n\nBaddie No.1 Klaus Maria Brandauer isn't too shabby and plays the psychopathy quite well. Practicing for a better movie with a smaller paycheck maybe? Barbara Carrera is actually quite good, an assassin with bad taste in fashion, but a nice looking girl who looks like she can do mean.

Certainly up to this point in time anyway! \n\nConnery has got himself down the gym for this one, but looks every one of his fifty plus years and then some. Thankfully the stuntmen do most of the work meaning a lot of the time he is wearing a helmet, headscarf, wet-suit or photographed from an obscure angle. Can always tell though - the stunt-man's hair moves while Connery's doesn't.\n\n(It is said that the original script included a scene where Bond puts the toupee on!) \n\nListen you know the score or you are very young indeed. Man wants to take over the world, the sexy girl (or two) comes along before they face the ticking bomb. Kim Bassinger looks fabulous with a fantastic figure, but what shocking dancer! Gets her in to a leotard (and I am not complaining), but what a baby elephant.Can't even do a 360 turn! As per usual she looks vaguely disinterested in anything and everything - but there was an Oscar in it down the road so keep going darling! \n\nThe logic of Bond is that he is sometimes very smart (knows how to operate secret equipment with no training!) and other times very stupid. Gets captured very easily, indeed doesn't seem to mind too much when he does. Usually there is a nice meal in it for him.\n\nBaddie No.1 Klaus Maria Brandauer isn't too shabby and plays the psychopathy quite well. Practicing for a better movie with a smaller paycheck maybe? Barbara Carrera is actually quite good, an assassin with bad taste in fashion, but a nice looking girl who looks like she can do mean. Even though Bond never cares who gets killed - as long as it is not him - so why is she bothering? \n\nBox office wise didn't do as well as the other "official" Bond of the day (Octopussy) and you can see why. Still, good enough for Sunday afternoon.

The later films since then have not turned back.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":93804,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1987-06-30","keywords":"defection,soviet afghanistan war,betrayal,afghanistan,returning character with different actor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4162371097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGUzNDA3YmYtYWNiZS00YjAxLTk3OTEtMTM5MWFhMjI2ZjVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGUzNDA3YmYtYWNiZS00YjAxLTk3OTEtMTM5MWFhMjI2ZjVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001096/","name":"Timothy Dalton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001881/","name":"Maryam d'Abo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0469103/","name":"Jeroen Krabbé"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322515/","name":"John Glen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933865/","name":"Michael G.

Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was "For Your Eyes Only" with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, "Goldfinger" is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.\n\nBefore I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I'd seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. "Do you expect me to talk?" "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.\n\nPerhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.\n\nBut it's more than that. Even watching "Goldfinger" today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about "Goldfinger". How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience.

Even though the first Bond film I ever saw was "For Your Eyes Only" with Roger Moore. I was very young and very much drawn in. I have seen every one of the Bond films and without a doubt, "Goldfinger" is the finest the 007 saga has to offer.\n\nBefore I had begun an appreciation of the Connery films, i.e. before I'd seen them, a good friend and cartooning mentor, Ross Paperman, sorted me out. He helped me see how Connery's Bond was suave and sophisticated but also demonstrated a quality the other Bonds do not portray: fear. Not a panicky soil-your-pants kind of fear, mind you. But Connery's Bond actually has a few anxious, sweat-soaked-brow moments. A perfect example is when Bond is strapped to a table as Goldfinger's captive with a laser beam primed to cut him in half. 007 has to think fast. "Do you expect me to talk?" "No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" A famous scene and line from Bond's most enjoyable film.\n\nPerhaps what makes the earlier films more enjoyable is that they had fresh, innovative elements that have now become cliché and gimmicky. The new films are often stale and already covered ground and they don't even appear to be trying anymore.\n\nBut it's more than that. Even watching "Goldfinger" today, having seen all the latest in special effects and technology that Hollywood has to offer, it still is riveting and thoroughly entertaining. That is also without the added advantage of being overly nostalgic about "Goldfinger". How could I? I hadn't even been born when it first hit theaters, and it was far from my first 007 experience. The story, the characters and the fun of "Goldfinger" is timeless and if given a chance could probably rope in a whole new generation of fans. It just doesn't seem likely to happen.\n\nMuch of the satire from the Austin Powers films is directly derived from the Connery films, especially "Goldfinger" and "Dr. No", proving their lasting effect on popular culture. As well, John Barry's scores from the Connery films are finding their way into the ears of a new generation through pop music as snippets from his soundtracks are sampled by such artists as Robbie Williams, Mono and Curve, to name a few.\n\nBut if by some fluke you read this and you haven't seen "Goldfinger" yet, do yourself right and acquaint yourself with the real James Bond.

It is not better than GoldenEye but it is good decent action movie with great explosions, dangerous stunts and great action. Who is my favorite James Bond 007? That will definitely be Pierce Brosnan no one else, since his first film GoldenEye. I saw this movie as a fifteen year old teen I even have a poster at home from this movie. I love this movie I thought Roger Spottiswoode did a good job directing it. I thought it had decent stunts, decent action, less humor than Roger Moore. If you agree with me good, if you disagree with me that is your opinion. Tomorrow Never Dies is the 18th entry in the official James Bond film series.\n\nPierce Brosnan makes his second appearance as Agent 007, James Bond heads to stop a media mogul's plan to induce war between China and the UK in order to obtain exclusive global media coverage. \n\nI love the opening scene in which in Russia Bond steals airplane with military missals and weapons who are been sold to international terrorist and brings them home. We see Pierce Brosnan flying an airplane. In real life Pierce Brosnan was scared of that airplane he thought the crew will killed him. You have a beautiful explosions from those airplanes. In Hamburg, Germany Bond breaks into the headquarters of Carver's media company and finds the office occupied by Henry Gupta, Carver's communications specialist and known techno-terrorist. He is been chased from security guys, because Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) makes entry and she touches the alarm. Bond is being fired by machine guns in which he flees great action sequences.\n\nBond drives a new car BMW 7 Series with a remote control on a cell phone Ericson. I miss those times in which we used Ericsson cell phone. In 2004 I had that phone for a year until it got broken and I had to buy a new phone. Bond with cell phone drives with his cell phone as a remotely without touching the steering wheel. I did read a complaint about this scene on IMDb that is not realistic and it shouldn't have been in this movie. Listen folks it is a fiction not realistic, it James Bond so who cares. I never mind that scene it was great action sequence in which Bond eluded his attackers and he drove his car off the wall ha ha.\n\nJames Bond and Wai Lin in Saigon, Vietnam jumped off the building in Carver's HQ. They escaped Carver's henchman and the flee off the building. They slide down Carver's poster while been handcuffed. Great action sequence in which Pierce Brosnan and Michele Yeoh drove handcuff on a motorcycle. That was incredible dangerous stunt. I read Michelle Yeoh did her own stunt on the motorcycle and it was really painful too sit on that bike her legs and body hurt her. Cars and helicopter chased them until they hanker the helicopter and it explodes. Practical effect real explosion no CGI or shaky cam real action. Bond in Vietnam that was interested story well done acted. \n\nBond on the ship a stealth craft that is invisible on the radar uses hand grenade and he actives with his watch the grenade explodes and he makes the ship visible on the radar. Bond kick's ass and he kill's on the end Carver. He throws Carver in to the sea drill excellent. Bond is fired with machine guns and he fires back killing several Carver's man.\n\nJonathan Pryce plays a good memorable villain, 'the emperor of the air,' Elliot Carver who was prepared to go to any length to increase the power of his media empire. If you think actor Jonathan Pryce did not a good job playing a bad guy. Watch him Ronin (1998) with Robert De Niro a year after this movie he played another bad guy.\n\nGötz Otto plays Stamper, the loyal psychopath henchman who follows Carver's orders murdering a group of shipwrecked British sailors. He was a good second bad guy but he wasn't memorable like Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp.\n\nJudi Dench is once again as M and she is more handsome and awesome than she was in GoldenEye. She is a good heart person in this movie I thought the actress did her job well. Samantha Bond, Joe Don Baker and Desmond Llewellyn - all reprise their "GoldenEye" roles.\n\nMichelle Yeoh did a good job as Wai Lin the new Bond girl she was awarded for the role of Wai Lin. A martial artist of considerable skills, she preferred to work alone - until she begins to trust 007.\n\nCarver's wife Paris was played by the great beauty, Teri Hatcher was excellent as Paris Carver's wife. She was good in her role and her performance. After an assassin kill's Carver's wife here we seen Bond's remorse and feelings, not a stone killer like Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace.\n\nTomorrow Never Dies (1997) is the eighteenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the second to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, with the screenplay written by Bruce Feirstein.\n\n10/10 Great Bond theme, it is my seventh favorite James Bond 007 movie in top ten favorite Bond films. I love this film to death and in my opinion it is way underrated.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":187790,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-12-12","keywords":"official james bond series,megalomaniac,media tycoon,world war three,ex boyfriend ex girlfriend relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What to Watch While You Wait for 'No Time to Die'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3602956569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"If the wait for 'No Time to Die' feels endless, we have three titles to make the time go by, including a heist film where Daniel Craig delivers both the action and delightful puns, a classic Bond title where the women don't pull any punches, and a trippy miniseries from 'No Time to Die' director Cary Joji Fukunaga."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006854/","name":"Roger Spottiswoode"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270761/","name":"Bruce Feirstein"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is not better than GoldenEye but it is good decent action movie with great explosions, dangerous stunts and great action. Who is my favorite James Bond 007? That will definitely be Pierce Brosnan no one else, since his first film GoldenEye. I saw this movie as a fifteen year old teen I even have a poster at home from this movie. I love this movie I thought Roger Spottiswoode did a good job directing it. I thought it had decent stunts, decent action, less humor than Roger Moore. If you agree with me good, if you disagree with me that is your opinion. Tomorrow Never Dies is the 18th entry in the official James Bond film series.\n\nPierce Brosnan makes his second appearance as Agent 007, James Bond heads to stop a media mogul's plan to induce war between China and the UK in order to obtain exclusive global media coverage. \n\nI love the opening scene in which in Russia Bond steals airplane with military missals and weapons who are been sold to international terrorist and brings them home. We see Pierce Brosnan flying an airplane. In real life Pierce Brosnan was scared of that airplane he thought the crew will killed him. You have a beautiful explosions from those airplanes. In Hamburg, Germany Bond breaks into the headquarters of Carver's media company and finds the office occupied by Henry Gupta, Carver's communications specialist and known techno-terrorist. He is been chased from security guys, because Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) makes entry and she touches the alarm. Bond is being fired by machine guns in which he flees great action sequences.\n\nBond drives a new car BMW 7 Series with a remote control on a cell phone Ericson. I miss those times in which we used Ericsson cell phone. In 2004 I had that phone for a year until it got broken and I had to buy a new phone. Bond with cell phone drives with his cell phone as a remotely without touching the steering wheel. I did read a complaint about this scene on IMDb that is not realistic and it shouldn't have been in this movie. Listen folks it is a fiction not realistic, it James Bond so who cares. I never mind that scene it was great action sequence in which Bond eluded his attackers and he drove his car off the wall ha ha.\n\nJames Bond and Wai Lin in Saigon, Vietnam jumped off the building in Carver's HQ. They escaped Carver's henchman and the flee off the building. They slide down Carver's poster while been handcuffed. Great action sequence in which Pierce Brosnan and Michele Yeoh drove handcuff on a motorcycle. That was incredible dangerous stunt. I read Michelle Yeoh did her own stunt on the motorcycle and it was really painful too sit on that bike her legs and body hurt her. Cars and helicopter chased them until they hanker the helicopter and it explodes. Practical effect real explosion no CGI or shaky cam real action. Bond in Vietnam that was interested story well done acted. \n\nBond on the ship a stealth craft that is invisible on the radar uses hand grenade and he actives with his watch the grenade explodes and he makes the ship visible on the radar. Bond kick's ass and he kill's on the end Carver. He throws Carver in to the sea drill excellent. Bond is fired with machine guns and he fires back killing several Carver's man.\n\nJonathan Pryce plays a good memorable villain, 'the emperor of the air,' Elliot Carver who was prepared to go to any length to increase the power of his media empire. If you think actor Jonathan Pryce did not a good job playing a bad guy. Watch him Ronin (1998) with Robert De Niro a year after this movie he played another bad guy.\n\nGötz Otto plays Stamper, the loyal psychopath henchman who follows Carver's orders murdering a group of shipwrecked British sailors. He was a good second bad guy but he wasn't memorable like Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp.\n\nJudi Dench is once again as M and she is more handsome and awesome than she was in GoldenEye. She is a good heart person in this movie I thought the actress did her job well. Samantha Bond, Joe Don Baker and Desmond Llewellyn - all reprise their "GoldenEye" roles.\n\nMichelle Yeoh did a good job as Wai Lin the new Bond girl she was awarded for the role of Wai Lin. A martial artist of considerable skills, she preferred to work alone - until she begins to trust 007.\n\nCarver's wife Paris was played by the great beauty, Teri Hatcher was excellent as Paris Carver's wife. She was good in her role and her performance. After an assassin kill's Carver's wife here we seen Bond's remorse and feelings, not a stone killer like Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace.\n\nTomorrow Never Dies (1997) is the eighteenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the second to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, with the screenplay written by Bruce Feirstein.\n\n10/10 Great Bond theme, it is my seventh favorite James Bond 007 movie in top ten favorite Bond films. I love this film to death and in my opinion it is way underrated.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":187790,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-12-12","keywords":"official james bond series,megalomaniac,media tycoon,world war three,ex boyfriend ex girlfriend relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What to Watch While You Wait for 'No Time to Die'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3602956569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"If the wait for 'No Time to Die' feels endless, we have three titles to make the time go by, including a heist film where Daniel Craig delivers both the action and delightful puns, a classic Bond title where the women don't pull any punches, and a trippy miniseries from 'No Time to Die' director Cary Joji Fukunaga.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006854/","name":"Roger Spottiswoode"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270761/","name":"Bruce Feirstein","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For fans there are plenty of references to previous Bond films, the most obvious being Diamonds Are Forever (1971), and New Zealand director Lee Tamahori uses some slick visuals to bring Brosnan's Bond bang up to date and throws everything in but the kitchen sink.\n\nHalle Berry is an above average Bond girl who is introduced by rising out of the water in homage to Ursula Andress in Dr. No but it's a shame Michael Madsen isn't given much to do. Judi Dench plays M with dignity once again and there's light relief with John Cleese stepping into the role as Q. Pop star Madonna makes an appearance in one scene after providing the disappointing theme tune, with an awful remix that appears over the end credits, but David Arnold's score is on par with his other Bond scores, although this lacks any thematic qualities to give Die Another Day an identity of it's own and seems to totally ignore the main song which usually gets referenced.\n\nThis certainly isn't the best Bond but it is not the worst either as some would like you to believe, although the criticism the film received made the producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson take notice as they let Brosnan go after only his 4th film and decided to reboot the franchise with a much harder edged Bond 4 years later with Daniel Craig.\n\nI always felt Brosnan had at least one more Bond left in him and that his tenure was prematurely cut short. For me he has the best Bond 'look' out of all the actors who has played him but didn't necessarily get the best directors or scripts he deserved to fully flesh out the role. He may have been 47 when this film was made, and fans were quick to allude the initials of the film's title spelled out DAD, meaning the character was no longer hip or relatable to a younger audience, however Daniel Craig was 52 when he filmed his last Bond so age should not have been an issue.\n\nDie Another Day deserves another look and to be re-evaluated, sure it's loud, flashy, full of explosions with some outlandish concepts that pushed fans too far but seen as a tribute to the previous 40 years of Bond it does a fitting job whilst being great entertainment.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":212296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-01-01","keywords":"north korea,iceland,gadget car,british secret service,weaponised car","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Die Another Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4225302809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmY3MmU0MjItNTM2Yi00ZDc2LTgzMmYtYTljOTMxNDY3OWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmY3MmU0MjItNTM2Yi00ZDc2LTgzMmYtYTljOTMxNDY3OWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000932/","name":"Halle Berry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683253/","name":"Rosamund Pike"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848414/","name":"Lee Tamahori"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade"}],"duration":"PT2H13M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Pop star Madonna makes an appearance in one scene after providing the disappointing theme tune, with an awful remix that appears over the end credits, but David Arnold's score is on par with his other Bond scores, although this lacks any thematic qualities to give Die Another Day an identity of it's own and seems to totally ignore the main song which usually gets referenced.\n\nThis certainly isn't the best Bond but it is not the worst either as some would like you to believe, although the criticism the film received made the producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson take notice as they let Brosnan go after only his 4th film and decided to reboot the franchise with a much harder edged Bond 4 years later with Daniel Craig.\n\nI always felt Brosnan had at least one more Bond left in him and that his tenure was prematurely cut short. For me he has the best Bond 'look' out of all the actors who has played him but didn't necessarily get the best directors or scripts he deserved to fully flesh out the role. He may have been 47 when this film was made, and fans were quick to allude the initials of the film's title spelled out DAD, meaning the character was no longer hip or relatable to a younger audience, however Daniel Craig was 52 when he filmed his last Bond so age should not have been an issue.\n\nDie Another Day deserves another look and to be re-evaluated, sure it's loud, flashy, full of explosions with some outlandish concepts that pushed fans too far but seen as a tribute to the previous 40 years of Bond it does a fitting job whilst being great entertainment.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":212296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-01-01","keywords":"north korea,iceland,gadget car,british secret service,weaponised car","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Die Another Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4225302809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmY3MmU0MjItNTM2Yi00ZDc2LTgzMmYtYTljOTMxNDY3OWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmY3MmU0MjItNTM2Yi00ZDc2LTgzMmYtYTljOTMxNDY3OWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000932/","name":"Halle Berry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683253/","name":"Rosamund Pike"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848414/","name":"Lee Tamahori"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade"],"duration":"PT2H13M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It stars Sean Connery, Tetsuro Tamba, Teru Shimada, Akiko Wakabayashi, Mie Hama, Karin Dor and Donald Pleasence. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Freddie Young.\n\nBond 5 and Connery once again tackles the role of 007. With American and Soviet space craft mysteriously vanishing from space, both nations are laying the blame at the other's door. Sensing a nuclear war could break out, M assigns Bond to Japan to investigate if there might be a third party stirring the hornets nest. Teaming up with the Japanese secret service, Bond uncovers evidence that SPECTRE is behind the plot to pitch the East and the West against each other.\n\nThis organisation does not tolerate failure.\n\nThunderball had broke box office records for Bond, gadgetry, outlandish stunts and a quip on the tongue had proved most profitable. It was planned originally that On Her Majesty's Secret Service would be number 5 in the series, but a change of tack to go for You Only Live Twice as the story gave producers Broccoli &amp; Saltzman the scope for a giganticus enormous production. However, it may be set in Japan and feature a Bond/Blofeld conflict, but Roald Dahl's script bares little resemblance to Ian Fleming's source novel. Although a massive financial success with a Worldwide gross of over $111 million, Bond 5 took $30 million less than Thunderball. Strange since this is a better film. Can we attribute the drop to it being a space age saga? Maybe, the rebirth of sci-fi was a few years away, and of course Bond had lost some fans who had grown tired, like Connery, of 007 relying on gadgets instead of brains and brawn to complete his missions. There was also the rival Casino Royale production, as bad as it was, to contend with, while the spy boom created by Bond had been overkilled elsewhere and was on the wane.\n\nExtortion is my business. Go away and think it over, gentlemen. I'm busy. \n\nTrue enough that You Only Live Twice has flaws, though they are far from being film killers if you like the gadgets and hi-techery side of the franchise? Connery announced once production was over that he was leaving the role of Bond behind. He had been close to breaking point after Thunderball, but finally the media circus, typecasting, the fanaticism and the character merely being a cypher for outrageous sequences, led Connery to finally call it a day. His displeasure shows in performance, oh it's professional, very much so, but the swagger and machismo from the earlier films has gone. Although Dahl's script tones down the "cheese" dialogue and unfolds as a plot of considerable World peril worth, characterisations are thinly drawn, making this reliant on production value and action sequences. Thankfully both are top dollar. And the ace up its sleeve is the long awaited face to face meeting of Bond and Blofeld.\n\nThe firing power inside my crater is enough to annihilate a small army. You can watch it all on TV. It's the last program you're likely to see.\n\nKen Adam's set design is fit to grace any epic in film history, as is Freddie Young's photography around the Japanese locales, Barry lays a beautiful Bond/Oriental score all over proceedings and Nancy Sinatra's title song is appealingly catchy. The action is excellently constructed by Gilbert (helming the first of three Bond movies on his CV), with the final battle at Blofeld's volcano crater base full of explosions, flying stunt men, expert choreography and meaty fights. Along the way we have been treated to Ninjas, Piranhas, poison, aeroplane peril and the awesome Little Nellie versus the big boy copter smack down! Then there's that Bond/Blofeld confrontation.

It stars Sean Connery, Tetsuro Tamba, Teru Shimada, Akiko Wakabayashi, Mie Hama, Karin Dor and Donald Pleasence. Music is scored by John Barry and cinematography by Freddie Young.\n\nBond 5 and Connery once again tackles the role of 007. With American and Soviet space craft mysteriously vanishing from space, both nations are laying the blame at the other's door. Sensing a nuclear war could break out, M assigns Bond to Japan to investigate if there might be a third party stirring the hornets nest. Teaming up with the Japanese secret service, Bond uncovers evidence that SPECTRE is behind the plot to pitch the East and the West against each other.\n\nThis organisation does not tolerate failure.\n\nThunderball had broke box office records for Bond, gadgetry, outlandish stunts and a quip on the tongue had proved most profitable. It was planned originally that On Her Majesty's Secret Service would be number 5 in the series, but a change of tack to go for You Only Live Twice as the story gave producers Broccoli &amp; Saltzman the scope for a giganticus enormous production. However, it may be set in Japan and feature a Bond/Blofeld conflict, but Roald Dahl's script bares little resemblance to Ian Fleming's source novel. Although a massive financial success with a Worldwide gross of over $111 million, Bond 5 took $30 million less than Thunderball. Strange since this is a better film. Can we attribute the drop to it being a space age saga? Maybe, the rebirth of sci-fi was a few years away, and of course Bond had lost some fans who had grown tired, like Connery, of 007 relying on gadgets instead of brains and brawn to complete his missions. There was also the rival Casino Royale production, as bad as it was, to contend with, while the spy boom created by Bond had been overkilled elsewhere and was on the wane.\n\nExtortion is my business. Go away and think it over, gentlemen. I'm busy. \n\nTrue enough that You Only Live Twice has flaws, though they are far from being film killers if you like the gadgets and hi-techery side of the franchise? Connery announced once production was over that he was leaving the role of Bond behind. He had been close to breaking point after Thunderball, but finally the media circus, typecasting, the fanaticism and the character merely being a cypher for outrageous sequences, led Connery to finally call it a day. His displeasure shows in performance, oh it's professional, very much so, but the swagger and machismo from the earlier films has gone. Although Dahl's script tones down the "cheese" dialogue and unfolds as a plot of considerable World peril worth, characterisations are thinly drawn, making this reliant on production value and action sequences. Thankfully both are top dollar. And the ace up its sleeve is the long awaited face to face meeting of Bond and Blofeld.\n\nThe firing power inside my crater is enough to annihilate a small army. You can watch it all on TV. It's the last program you're likely to see.\n\nKen Adam's set design is fit to grace any epic in film history, as is Freddie Young's photography around the Japanese locales, Barry lays a beautiful Bond/Oriental score all over proceedings and Nancy Sinatra's title song is appealingly catchy. The action is excellently constructed by Gilbert (helming the first of three Bond movies on his CV), with the final battle at Blofeld's volcano crater base full of explosions, flying stunt men, expert choreography and meaty fights. Along the way we have been treated to Ninjas, Piranhas, poison, aeroplane peril and the awesome Little Nellie versus the big boy copter smack down! Then there's that Bond/Blofeld confrontation. Well worth the wait, with Pleasence visually scary with bald head (setting the marker for bald villainy to follow in TV and cinema it seems) and scar across his eye. Pleasence is also very low key with his menace, which is perfect, we don't want pantomime and the scenes with Bond work wonderfully well.\n\nIt made less than the film before it and it has fierce critics in Bond and Fleming circles. But it's a Bond film that pays rich rewards on revisits, where the artistry on show really shines through in this HD/Upscale age. 8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":103978,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1967-06-13","keywords":"faked death,secret headquarters,japan,ninja,secret organization","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"These Bond Women Are Changing the Spy Game","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3772365849","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzI0Yjg1NTEtNDk3Zi00MzljLTk5Y2MtNmYwYWNlMTViYzVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzI0Yjg1NTEtNDk3Zi00MzljLTk5Y2MtNmYwYWNlMTViYzVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief, presented by Progressive, let's look at the evolution of the women who loved the spy, and hear from four who co-star with Daniel Craig in Bond 25.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0906686/","name":"Akiko Wakabayashi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357240/","name":"Mie Hama"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0318150/","name":"Lewis Gilbert"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089169/","name":"Harold Jack Bloom","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001094/","name":"Roald Dahl","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Anyone who believes this either: a) has never seen the movie and is judging it solely on the fact that star George Lazenby only lasted one film or b) has never seen DIAMONDS ON FOREVER, which is a hundred times more painful to sit through. This movie has its flaws, no doubt, but it's still a strong movie with a good plot. It's forgettable, but that's more a problem stemming from mediocre casting and weak performances from the principles. The film is plenty engaging while you're watching it, and the story is actually pretty good. Despite swapping out our lead actor, the movie continues (sort of) in the same canon of the previous films. Following the events that occurred in Japan in the previous film, Ernst Stavro Blofeld is James Bond's primary target but MI6 believes the chase is done. M pressures Bond to give up his pursuit of the madman, but Bond believes he might have discovered a lead in a chance meeting with a beautiful woman named Teresa "Tracy" di Vicenzo. Her father is head of a criminal syndicate and has information on where Bond might find Blofeld and offers to trade the information if Bond were to consider marrying his daughter. Initially reluctant, Bond's relationship with Tracy blossoms while he begins an investigation into a medical research lab in the Swiss Alps where Blofeld has gathered a harem of beautiful women to bring his latest plan to fruition.\n\nGeorge Lazenby was not an actor when he was given the role of Connery's successor in the iconic role of James Bond. The closest he'd done was some commercials for chocolate (or something) but he was primarily a model. I'll admit, this is an instant strike against the man. I'm a major fan of this series and it's an insult that someone might've hired this man on the basis that he's good at mugging for the camera and not you know acting. It wasn't until about a half hour or so into the movie that I finally became comfortable with Lazenby in the role. He takes some warming up but he did a well enough job filling the shoes of Connery. I won't go so far as to say he's on Connery's level, but he's not as bad as so many detractors would have you believe. He's certainly got the smug confidence of 007. Diana Rigg (of the television series "The Avengers") is Tracy di Vicenzo, the first women to be more than a casual fling for Bond. She and Lazenby have a good chemistry together but I couldn't help but find it to be more than a little shoddy that their relationship is crammed down our throats over the course of a montage. We're expected to believe that James Bond, who has never seen his women as more than playthings, suddenly develops tender emotions over the course of a Louis Armstrong song. Montage gripes aside, Riggs and Lazenby are a strong pair with a believable spark between them but Riggs didn't pop off the screen like previous Bond women like Ursula Andress or Honor Blackman. If Tracy hadn't been the first (and one of the only) to win Bond's heart, there would be nothing about her performance that would stick with you after the credits rolled. Telly Savalas fills the role of Blofeld for the film, and this is where my interest wanes. Donald Pleasance was a perfect Blofeld in YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE. He is the man I imagine when I picture Bond's ultimate arch-nemesis, and Savalas doesn't even come close to matching him. Pleasance was sinister and his performance brought a perfect evil to the character. Savalas makes Blofeld charming, with a warm demeanor that contradicts everything Pleasance instilled in the character in the previous movie. It just feels so wrong. Sorry, Telly. You're no Blofeld.\n\nIf Connery had stuck around and brought his usual awesomeness back to the role, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE would've probably be remembered as the best of the early films. In my opinion, some more thoughtful casting is all that stood between this movie and the respect it deserved. It does have a few other issues, namely the over-long run-time and a couple technical problems. The movie is one of the longest 007 movies in the series at nearly two and a half hours, and it feels like it. I blame it on the excessive ski sequences. Ski fights are boring and this movie goes a little overboard. I can only see so many henchmen go careening out of control before I get bored. It's made worse with the horrible rear-screen projection used for the principle actors. There is no way to make it look realistic and it looks horribly cheesy. And we get not one, but two extended ski chases. On a more positive note, I love the setting. Blofeld's research lab is perched on the peak of a mountain in the Swiss Alps and it makes for a wicked final battle when Bond and his compains helicopter in for a full assault. An assault that ends in wait for it a bobsled chase. With rear projection. I understand though; technology was limited at the time. It doesn't make it any less lame. I did enjoy Blofeld's scheme in the movie though. It's a little more complex than the average nuclear weapon theft and involves a dozen gorgeous women. The man knows how to plan.\n\nThe movie culminates in one of the most important sequences in all the 007 films, as it gives us the first real emotional insight into his character. He opens up and expresses an emotion other than "murder" (murder is an emotion, right?) and he is immediately punished for it. Watching ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE can be a bit of an endurance trial, but it's a well-worth it. It's a must-see for fans of the series.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86342,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1969-12-19","keywords":"007,returning character with different actor,bond girl,switzerland,ski chase","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"On Her Majestys Secret Service","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2996871705","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTc1MjIxN2MtMTk1MS00MmZjLWE3MTctYzVmMWMxOTdkZjE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTc1MjIxN2MtMTk1MS00MmZjLWE3MTctYzVmMWMxOTdkZjE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for On Her Majestys Secret Service"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0493872/","name":"George Lazenby"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001671/","name":"Diana Rigg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001699/","name":"Telly Savalas"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0402597/","name":"Peter R.

It is not better than GoldenEye but it is good decent action movie with great explosions, dangerous stunts and great action. Who is my favorite James Bond 007? That will definitely be Pierce Brosnan no one else, since his first film GoldenEye. I saw this movie as a fifteen year old teen I even have a poster at home from this movie. I love this movie I thought Roger Spottiswoode did a good job directing it. I thought it had decent stunts, decent action, less humor than Roger Moore. If you agree with me good, if you disagree with me that is your opinion. Tomorrow Never Dies is the 18th entry in the official James Bond film series.\n\nPierce Brosnan makes his second appearance as Agent 007, James Bond heads to stop a media mogul's plan to induce war between China and the UK in order to obtain exclusive global media coverage. \n\nI love the opening scene in which in Russia Bond steals airplane with military missals and weapons who are been sold to international terrorist and brings them home. We see Pierce Brosnan flying an airplane. In real life Pierce Brosnan was scared of that airplane he thought the crew will killed him. You have a beautiful explosions from those airplanes. In Hamburg, Germany Bond breaks into the headquarters of Carver's media company and finds the office occupied by Henry Gupta, Carver's communications specialist and known techno-terrorist. He is been chased from security guys, because Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) makes entry and she touches the alarm. Bond is being fired by machine guns in which he flees great action sequences.\n\nBond drives a new car BMW 7 Series with a remote control on a cell phone Ericson. I miss those times in which we used Ericsson cell phone. In 2004 I had that phone for a year until it got broken and I had to buy a new phone. Bond with cell phone drives with his cell phone as a remotely without touching the steering wheel. I did read a complaint about this scene on IMDb that is not realistic and it shouldn't have been in this movie. Listen folks it is a fiction not realistic, it James Bond so who cares. I never mind that scene it was great action sequence in which Bond eluded his attackers and he drove his car off the wall ha ha.\n\nJames Bond and Wai Lin in Saigon, Vietnam jumped off the building in Carver's HQ. They escaped Carver's henchman and the flee off the building. They slide down Carver's poster while been handcuffed. Great action sequence in which Pierce Brosnan and Michele Yeoh drove handcuff on a motorcycle. That was incredible dangerous stunt. I read Michelle Yeoh did her own stunt on the motorcycle and it was really painful too sit on that bike her legs and body hurt her. Cars and helicopter chased them until they hanker the helicopter and it explodes. Practical effect real explosion no CGI or shaky cam real action. Bond in Vietnam that was interested story well done acted. \n\nBond on the ship a stealth craft that is invisible on the radar uses hand grenade and he actives with his watch the grenade explodes and he makes the ship visible on the radar. Bond kick's ass and he kill's on the end Carver. He throws Carver in to the sea drill excellent. Bond is fired with machine guns and he fires back killing several Carver's man.\n\nJonathan Pryce plays a good memorable villain, 'the emperor of the air,' Elliot Carver who was prepared to go to any length to increase the power of his media empire. If you think actor Jonathan Pryce did not a good job playing a bad guy. Watch him Ronin (1998) with Robert De Niro a year after this movie he played another bad guy.\n\nGötz Otto plays Stamper, the loyal psychopath henchman who follows Carver's orders murdering a group of shipwrecked British sailors. He was a good second bad guy but he wasn't memorable like Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp.\n\nJudi Dench is once again as M and she is more handsome and awesome than she was in GoldenEye. She is a good heart person in this movie I thought the actress did her job well. Samantha Bond, Joe Don Baker and Desmond Llewellyn - all reprise their "GoldenEye" roles.\n\nMichelle Yeoh did a good job as Wai Lin the new Bond girl she was awarded for the role of Wai Lin. A martial artist of considerable skills, she preferred to work alone - until she begins to trust 007.\n\nCarver's wife Paris was played by the great beauty, Teri Hatcher was excellent as Paris Carver's wife. She was good in her role and her performance. After an assassin kill's Carver's wife here we seen Bond's remorse and feelings, not a stone killer like Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace.\n\nTomorrow Never Dies (1997) is the eighteenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the second to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, with the screenplay written by Bruce Feirstein.\n\n10/10 Great Bond theme, it is my seventh favorite James Bond 007 movie in top ten favorite Bond films. I love this film to death and in my opinion it is way underrated.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":187790,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-12-12","keywords":"official james bond series,megalomaniac,media tycoon,world war three,ex boyfriend ex girlfriend relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What to Watch While You Wait for 'No Time to Die'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3602956569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"If the wait for 'No Time to Die' feels endless, we have three titles to make the time go by, including a heist film where Daniel Craig delivers both the action and delightful puns, a classic Bond title where the women don't pull any punches, and a trippy miniseries from 'No Time to Die' director Cary Joji Fukunaga."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006854/","name":"Roger Spottiswoode"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270761/","name":"Bruce Feirstein"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is not better than GoldenEye but it is good decent action movie with great explosions, dangerous stunts and great action. Who is my favorite James Bond 007? That will definitely be Pierce Brosnan no one else, since his first film GoldenEye. I saw this movie as a fifteen year old teen I even have a poster at home from this movie. I love this movie I thought Roger Spottiswoode did a good job directing it. I thought it had decent stunts, decent action, less humor than Roger Moore. If you agree with me good, if you disagree with me that is your opinion. Tomorrow Never Dies is the 18th entry in the official James Bond film series.\n\nPierce Brosnan makes his second appearance as Agent 007, James Bond heads to stop a media mogul's plan to induce war between China and the UK in order to obtain exclusive global media coverage. \n\nI love the opening scene in which in Russia Bond steals airplane with military missals and weapons who are been sold to international terrorist and brings them home. We see Pierce Brosnan flying an airplane. In real life Pierce Brosnan was scared of that airplane he thought the crew will killed him. You have a beautiful explosions from those airplanes. In Hamburg, Germany Bond breaks into the headquarters of Carver's media company and finds the office occupied by Henry Gupta, Carver's communications specialist and known techno-terrorist. He is been chased from security guys, because Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) makes entry and she touches the alarm. Bond is being fired by machine guns in which he flees great action sequences.\n\nBond drives a new car BMW 7 Series with a remote control on a cell phone Ericson. I miss those times in which we used Ericsson cell phone. In 2004 I had that phone for a year until it got broken and I had to buy a new phone. Bond with cell phone drives with his cell phone as a remotely without touching the steering wheel. I did read a complaint about this scene on IMDb that is not realistic and it shouldn't have been in this movie. Listen folks it is a fiction not realistic, it James Bond so who cares. I never mind that scene it was great action sequence in which Bond eluded his attackers and he drove his car off the wall ha ha.\n\nJames Bond and Wai Lin in Saigon, Vietnam jumped off the building in Carver's HQ. They escaped Carver's henchman and the flee off the building. They slide down Carver's poster while been handcuffed. Great action sequence in which Pierce Brosnan and Michele Yeoh drove handcuff on a motorcycle. That was incredible dangerous stunt. I read Michelle Yeoh did her own stunt on the motorcycle and it was really painful too sit on that bike her legs and body hurt her. Cars and helicopter chased them until they hanker the helicopter and it explodes. Practical effect real explosion no CGI or shaky cam real action. Bond in Vietnam that was interested story well done acted. \n\nBond on the ship a stealth craft that is invisible on the radar uses hand grenade and he actives with his watch the grenade explodes and he makes the ship visible on the radar. Bond kick's ass and he kill's on the end Carver. He throws Carver in to the sea drill excellent. Bond is fired with machine guns and he fires back killing several Carver's man.\n\nJonathan Pryce plays a good memorable villain, 'the emperor of the air,' Elliot Carver who was prepared to go to any length to increase the power of his media empire. If you think actor Jonathan Pryce did not a good job playing a bad guy. Watch him Ronin (1998) with Robert De Niro a year after this movie he played another bad guy.\n\nGötz Otto plays Stamper, the loyal psychopath henchman who follows Carver's orders murdering a group of shipwrecked British sailors. He was a good second bad guy but he wasn't memorable like Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp.\n\nJudi Dench is once again as M and she is more handsome and awesome than she was in GoldenEye. She is a good heart person in this movie I thought the actress did her job well. Samantha Bond, Joe Don Baker and Desmond Llewellyn - all reprise their "GoldenEye" roles.\n\nMichelle Yeoh did a good job as Wai Lin the new Bond girl she was awarded for the role of Wai Lin. A martial artist of considerable skills, she preferred to work alone - until she begins to trust 007.\n\nCarver's wife Paris was played by the great beauty, Teri Hatcher was excellent as Paris Carver's wife. She was good in her role and her performance. After an assassin kill's Carver's wife here we seen Bond's remorse and feelings, not a stone killer like Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace.\n\nTomorrow Never Dies (1997) is the eighteenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the second to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, with the screenplay written by Bruce Feirstein.\n\n10/10 Great Bond theme, it is my seventh favorite James Bond 007 movie in top ten favorite Bond films. I love this film to death and in my opinion it is way underrated.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":187790,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-12-12","keywords":"official james bond series,megalomaniac,media tycoon,world war three,ex boyfriend ex girlfriend relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What to Watch While You Wait for 'No Time to Die'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3602956569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"If the wait for 'No Time to Die' feels endless, we have three titles to make the time go by, including a heist film where Daniel Craig delivers both the action and delightful puns, a classic Bond title where the women don't pull any punches, and a trippy miniseries from 'No Time to Die' director Cary Joji Fukunaga.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006854/","name":"Roger Spottiswoode"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270761/","name":"Bruce Feirstein","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He may have been 47 when this film was made, and fans were quick to allude the initials of the film's title spelled out DAD, meaning the character was no longer hip or relatable to a younger audience, however Daniel Craig was 52 when he filmed his last Bond so age should not have been an issue.\n\nDie Another Day deserves another look and to be re-evaluated, sure it's loud, flashy, full of explosions with some outlandish concepts that pushed fans too far but seen as a tribute to the previous 40 years of Bond it does a fitting job whilst being great entertainment.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":212296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-01-01","keywords":"north korea,iceland,gadget car,british secret service,weaponised car","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Die Another Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4225302809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmY3MmU0MjItNTM2Yi00ZDc2LTgzMmYtYTljOTMxNDY3OWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmY3MmU0MjItNTM2Yi00ZDc2LTgzMmYtYTljOTMxNDY3OWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000932/","name":"Halle Berry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683253/","name":"Rosamund Pike"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848414/","name":"Lee Tamahori"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade"}],"duration":"PT2H13M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He may have been 47 when this film was made, and fans were quick to allude the initials of the film's title spelled out DAD, meaning the character was no longer hip or relatable to a younger audience, however Daniel Craig was 52 when he filmed his last Bond so age should not have been an issue.\n\nDie Another Day deserves another look and to be re-evaluated, sure it's loud, flashy, full of explosions with some outlandish concepts that pushed fans too far but seen as a tribute to the previous 40 years of Bond it does a fitting job whilst being great entertainment.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":212296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2003-01-01","keywords":"north korea,iceland,gadget car,british secret service,weaponised car","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Die Another Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4225302809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmY3MmU0MjItNTM2Yi00ZDc2LTgzMmYtYTljOTMxNDY3OWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmY3MmU0MjItNTM2Yi00ZDc2LTgzMmYtYTljOTMxNDY3OWZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000932/","name":"Halle Berry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683253/","name":"Rosamund Pike"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848414/","name":"Lee Tamahori"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade"],"duration":"PT2H13M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Martin Clunes and Dominic Minghella should (and I'm sure do) take intense pride over their creation. The writing is the best in the business, the director Ben Bolt is amazing, and the acting is subtle, natural, hilarious and touching. In addition to Martin Clunes, Caroline Catz has shown herself to be one of the best of her generation. And the scenery and music, of course, are beautiful.\n\nPleeeeeeaaaaaaaase, please, please Mr. and Mrs. Clunes: Don't sell out to us Yanks.

I'd be walking around with a tin foil hat "Cos Aliens are here" \n\nBack to the Pilot.... Our British lead Tom Ellis was all suave and smooth like a very old Brandy. Whilst Lauren German was a little Ditsy but his nemesis, but in truth sexy and funny. A future partner in crime.\n\nWith myself and a few hundred UK Facebook friends we can't wait for the next episode. Please.. those petitioners who wanted this banned. have you seen it?

I still think this is one of the coolest shows ever, and I freely admit that Knight Rider can be pretty idiotic at the same time. The series was basically a cartoon and that can make it hard for some people to revisit when they grow up. I think that Knight Rider is one of the best unintentionally hilarious shows ever created. The silly aspects of the series make it just that much more entertaining in adult life. Knight Rider is an endearing and nostalgic series that finds a way to entertain you despite how ridiculous it can all be. "Michael &amp; KITT", how can you not feel the tug of the old days back in the 80s when you hear that? We all grew up with this show back in the 1980's as kids, the appeal of a cool looking black sports car that could TALK was irresistible back then. Today I guess we look back at Knight Rider and wonder "wtf". It might make us recoil, and get pretty damn embarrassed with some of the out there stuff we used to think was so cool. \n\nThe immense flaws of logic and continuity that plagued Knight Rider were easily hidden to a casual child viewing the show back in 1982 (I was 5 years old), but they really stick out like a sore thumb when viewed through adult eyes. The same damn stock footage was used ad nauseum, the frames were sped up to make a car going 20 mph look like it was zipping along at 400 mph, blue filters were always used to make it look like it was night time; and as others have mentioned, the fight scenes were never, ever believable. I don't think they even had any kind of trained fight specialist on Knight Rider, it always seemed like the director just told Hasselhoff or the stunt doubles to simply go out there and just make up some crap that could pass for jujitsu or tae-kwon-do. But again, this is what makes Knight Rider so fun.\n\nThis series is loaded with all kinds of unintentional hilarity. Some of my favorites are when David Hasselhoff's stunt double wears a mustache in a take, or the episode when the stunt double's Michael Knight afro wig accidentally flew off while he was doing one of those patented "Hasselhoff-Fu" roundhouse karate kicks. It seemed like Michael Knight could take down any bad guy with one well placed karate kick to the head. Let's all be honest with ourselves, a big reason this show was popular was because it featured a really cool looking black car with that cool looking red scanner mounted in the front. Everyone loved that car, and there is no doubt that is the reason Knight Rider is a part of American pop cultural lore. I'm 26 1/2 years old today and I still like this show because it's my childhood, and because it's from the 80's that we all love and grew up in. Things would get so stupid, you often wondered if there would be a button on KITT's dashboard that would say "Drive Very Fast" instead of "Super Pursuit Mode". The show didn't magically become any more nerdier in the 2000's then it was in the 1980s. Even back in the early-mid 80s most people over the age of 15 had a tendency to laugh at Knight Rider. It was always cool to children that didn't pick apart the series, but not so to anyone above the 9th grade. The prime target audience was boys that were roughly 9 years of age. So if you were already over the age of 13 back in 1982 when Knight Rider first aired, then you were likely going to always be too cool for a show like this that leaned on being a live action cartoon. Yes it is amazing that this series lasted on NBC's prime time for 4 years. But aren't we glad it did?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31913,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1982-09-26","keywords":"vehicle driving by itself,private detective,crime fighter,pontiac trans am,1980s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001327/","name":"David Hasselhoff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0611811/","name":"Edward Mulhare","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000865/","name":"Richard Basehart"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088140/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488991/","name":"Glen A.

Unlike TV programming today, at least it had it's own originality. Kids could watch it without a lot of heavy violence or nudity, (which was like none in Knight Rider. to name only a few.) on the contrary, it was very much sci-fi, as well as drama, and action.

However, from the first 5 minutes of season 4 it was quite clear that something went wrong with the plot, indeed I can only guess that the script writers lost the plot, literally. Nothing that happened really made that much sense, and the story became very disjointed, confusing and at times patronising. I watched every episode of season 4, and it seemed to get a little better after episode 6, but still no where near as good as season 1-3. I lost count the number of times I asked myself, why would they do that, or can the Aliens be really that stupid ? I can only hope they sacked the season 4 script writers for the final season and hired people who can actually write a story that makes sense.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":87146,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2011-06-19","keywords":"alien,military,father son relationship,alien invasion,supernatural power","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001864/","name":"Noah Wyle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2397366/","name":"Drew Roy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2684485/","name":"Maxim Knight"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003158/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088248/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305826/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Requiem","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi250064153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MTMyMjkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYxNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MTMyMjkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYxNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"See the first full trailer for the fourth season of TNT's "Falling Skies"."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
