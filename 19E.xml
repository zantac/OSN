The show is just plain cute. More you watch it the better you will enjoy it.\n\nThey are not doing a true crime story here, this is light fare. \n\nOn a last note I love the fact it is openly Toronto based.

It reminds me of Castle, the story about a father and a crime solving duo. The story lines are smooth and the comedy is natural. The most important thing here is that while it is being compared to classic shows, it has a present twist. From a personal point of few, this feels fresh to me and that's why I like it. I hope this as long run. After Castle ended, I had nothing of this genre to watch! A comedy, crime series helps in reviving my mood. Its not about the art, the originality nor the clichés for me, its about the successful characterisation which transcends the realm of the 2 dimensional television and plays out as a reality in my head. I'm giving 8/10 for just that. The show has managed to reach out to me and I would like to show my appreciation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3723,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It reminds me of Castle, the story about a father and a crime solving duo. The story lines are smooth and the comedy is natural. The most important thing here is that while it is being compared to classic shows, it has a present twist. From a personal point of few, this feels fresh to me and that's why I like it. I hope this as long run. After Castle ended, I had nothing of this genre to watch! A comedy, crime series helps in reviving my mood. Its not about the art, the originality nor the clichés for me, its about the successful characterisation which transcends the realm of the 2 dimensional television and plays out as a reality in my head. I'm giving 8/10 for just that. The show has managed to reach out to me and I would like to show my appreciation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3723,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm not watching re-made versions of other mystery shows. The premise I have seen a hundred times. The male female partners, flirting and will they wont they thing. Heck it works though. \n\nI have watched a lot of detective shows that just rehash the same stories. So far the stories and mysteries have been different and not just rewritten or predictable.

Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.\n\nThe thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.\n\nAlso all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).\n\nThe reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. \n\n9 out of 10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-09-20","keywords":"shared universe,ampersand in title,punctuation in title,sexually motivated,sexually motivated assault","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002127/","name":"Mariska Hargitay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005221/","name":"Christopher Meloni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001384/","name":"Ice-T"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069685/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080319/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3079995673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

 --- Description: Un aller simple: Directed by Laurent Heynemann. With Jacques Villeret, Barbara Schulz, Lorànt Deutsch, Jean Benguigui. I am a civil servant at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. My boss, Loupiac, is having an affair with my wife. I can't take it any longer. I accepted this mission to escape the situation. 'Humanitarian Attaché': I have to take a young clandestine back to his country. He belongs to the tribe of the Grey Men of Irguiz, secluded since prehistoric times in a secret city of the Great Atlas. The kid is amazing. I suspect that his identity papers are fake, that he probably made up this legend. But to believe him is the best way to return him to his home, and it makes me feel good. The power of a legend is unbelievable, once you've decided to believe in it... Being with the kid makes me rediscover life, revive my dreams. And Valérie, the guide he talked me into employing, is about to become the biggest love of my life.

Acting overall is top notch and dialogue delivery is super real-like and despite at times unfitting soundtrack and too many close-up shots the movie pays too much attention to unnecessary dialogue and filler scenes and in the end it doesn't seem whole.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":780,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-28","keywords":"algeria,title directed by female,f rated,triple f rated,one word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1136312601","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDcwODZmYmQtMjFjZS00N2IzLTkyZGEtNjJjODNlZDNkNDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDcwODZmYmQtMjFjZS00N2IzLTkyZGEtNjJjODNlZDNkNDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000272/","name":"Fanny Ardant"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308039/","name":"Louis Garrel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9860935/","name":"Dylan Robert"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494069/","name":"Maïwenn"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049689/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0555809/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0218843/","name":"Mathieu Demy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494069/","name":"Maïwenn"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In general the movie feels like two movies stitched together harshly with only one plot line fully developed, the story of the main heroine (although in the first part of the movie she doesn't seem a main character). Acting overall is top notch and dialogue delivery is super real-like and despite at times unfitting soundtrack and too many close-up shots the movie pays too much attention to unnecessary dialogue and filler scenes and in the end it doesn't seem whole.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":780,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-28","keywords":"algeria,title directed by female,f rated,triple f rated,one word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1136312601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDcwODZmYmQtMjFjZS00N2IzLTkyZGEtNjJjODNlZDNkNDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDcwODZmYmQtMjFjZS00N2IzLTkyZGEtNjJjODNlZDNkNDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000272/","name":"Fanny Ardant","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308039/","name":"Louis Garrel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9860935/","name":"Dylan Robert"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494069/","name":"Maïwenn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049689/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0555809/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0218843/","name":"Mathieu Demy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494069/","name":"Maïwenn"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Pas du tout ! Because soon Patricia is pregnant by her lover : although François is elated (my own flash and blood) , the lovers are out on a limb:shall they divorce ?\n\nThis is good psychological drama , filmed on location in the grandiose landscapes of the Jura Mountains (the cinematography is splendid indeed) , well acted and off the beaten track . The social context , the sawmill François and his wife run, which runs into difficulties (although it's not mentioned in the film , importations of wood from North Europa cause problems )is carefully depicted and one feels husband's and wife's love for their work and for the raw material ,wood: François tells the woman from the adoption agency he would take his foster child to the forest and make him share his passion (but it does not convince the lady). And he will do it ,even though it will be short-lived.(an admirable scene)\n\nUnfortunately , when you've got no child, you 're not "normal ": the quarrel during the grand-parents' golden wedding is revealing ,and François 's humiliation knows no bound .\n\nEllipsis is a common procedure in film narrative ,but here it's brilliantly used: ; after they've seen François rock the baby in his arms , there's no scene between the four protagonists of the affair ; Noémie ,the cheated wife ,waits to be home .\n\nRecommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-07","keywords":"paternity,wood,sawmill,husband wife relationship,infidelity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2478489881","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NWQzNjEtYzkwZS00NTAyLWJmNjItZTczYTJiMGRkNjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NWQzNjEtYzkwZS00NTAyLWJmNjItZTczYTJiMGRkNjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504267/","name":"Jalil Lespert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2864046/","name":"Louise Bourgoin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235461/","name":"Mélanie Doutey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292833/","name":"Raphaël Jacoulot"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011118/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346444/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6940903/","name":"Benjamin Adam"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8166889/","name":"Fadette Drouard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292833/","name":"Raphaël Jacoulot"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Pas du tout ! Because soon Patricia is pregnant by her lover : although François is elated (my own flash and blood) , the lovers are out on a limb:shall they divorce ?\n\nThis is good psychological drama , filmed on location in the grandiose landscapes of the Jura Mountains (the cinematography is splendid indeed) , well acted and off the beaten track . The social context , the sawmill François and his wife run, which runs into difficulties (although it's not mentioned in the film , importations of wood from North Europa cause problems )is carefully depicted and one feels husband's and wife's love for their work and for the raw material ,wood: François tells the woman from the adoption agency he would take his foster child to the forest and make him share his passion (but it does not convince the lady). And he will do it ,even though it will be short-lived.(an admirable scene)\n\nUnfortunately , when you've got no child, you 're not "normal ": the quarrel during the grand-parents' golden wedding is revealing ,and François 's humiliation knows no bound .\n\nEllipsis is a common procedure in film narrative ,but here it's brilliantly used: ; after they've seen François rock the baby in his arms , there's no scene between the four protagonists of the affair ; Noémie ,the cheated wife ,waits to be home .\n\nRecommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-07","keywords":"paternity,wood,sawmill,husband wife relationship,infidelity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2478489881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NWQzNjEtYzkwZS00NTAyLWJmNjItZTczYTJiMGRkNjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NWQzNjEtYzkwZS00NTAyLWJmNjItZTczYTJiMGRkNjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504267/","name":"Jalil Lespert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2864046/","name":"Louise Bourgoin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235461/","name":"Mélanie Doutey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292833/","name":"Raphaël Jacoulot"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011118/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6940903/","name":"Benjamin Adam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8166889/","name":"Fadette Drouard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292833/","name":"Raphaël Jacoulot"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Pas du tout !

I'm not sure who these films are aimed at, but that is beside the point. My main problem with this film is the misogyny and it is a big problem. Very rarely does a film make me cross, but this one did. It also makes me cross that I have only found one review that picks up on this issue. It's on a website called Paste if anyone wants to look it up. Many people question, why make up a lesbian romance for Mary Anning when there is no evidence for one, but no-one questions the misogynistic approach. I personally don't have a problem with the lesbian bit -we have been written out of history.\n\nThe initial premise of the film and main focus of the first half hour or so, it to highlight the misogyny of the scientific establishment at the time and Mr Murchison's treatment of his wife. The ultimate irony is that, Francis Lee by his portrayal of Charlotte Murchison and Elizabeth Philpot (Fiona Shaw), does both these women a great dis-service. Charlotte is portrayed as vapid and Elizabeth as some old hippy type making herbal remedies, when they were both accomplished scientists in their own right and had interesting lives. The film is misogynistic because it gives less attribution to their paleontology achievements than did the male-dominated natural history circles at the time!\n\nUnless Francis Lee simply wants to maintain his position as prime director of LGBT films (I thought God's Own Country was excellent), I don't know why he felt the need, when Mary Anning had a very eventful life which would have made a much better film, to create a mythical lesbian romance. He would have done just as well to base a film on her brother Joseph. Rich man from London turns up in Lyme Regis with his errant son, leaves him with Joseph because he thinks a bit of sea air and hard work in the upholstery trade will turn his life around. A bit of drudgery with horsehair and cotton wadding, then sex on a pebbly beach - job done!\n\nI gave the film six stars because it was well acted and the cinematography and costumes were excellent. However two last points that I think were huge gaffs. No-one in 1840 and who kept their own chickens would cook an addled egg or one with a chick in (it happened so fast I couldn't quite see) as eggs would be collected every day and you know if a hen has gone broody is sitting on eggs.

Acting overall is top notch and dialogue delivery is super real-like and despite at times unfitting soundtrack and too many close-up shots the movie pays too much attention to unnecessary dialogue and filler scenes and in the end it doesn't seem whole.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":780,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-28","keywords":"algeria,title directed by female,f rated,triple f rated,one word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1136312601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDcwODZmYmQtMjFjZS00N2IzLTkyZGEtNjJjODNlZDNkNDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDcwODZmYmQtMjFjZS00N2IzLTkyZGEtNjJjODNlZDNkNDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000272/","name":"Fanny Ardant","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308039/","name":"Louis Garrel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9860935/","name":"Dylan Robert"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494069/","name":"Maïwenn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049689/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0555809/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0218843/","name":"Mathieu Demy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494069/","name":"Maïwenn"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is a very moving and powerful movie that shows the power of loss and love. All the main characters are seriously flawed and damaged people that because they come together (thanks to the angry Tyler) become better people and find their own reasons to truly live life (something none of them have done in years).\n\nI thought the acting was very well done. Some i have heard complain about certain scenes but truthfully, if you have ever suffered any of the losses or pains that these people have, they would realize that the actions are spot on! \n\nI am wowed by the movie, stunned truly... I am also very glad that this movie was made, not as eye candy for Pattinson but rather to show his and others talent on such a touching, difficult, and painful subject. This would not have been made if it were not for the talent in this movie that pushed for it to be made, THANK YOU!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is a very moving and powerful movie that shows the power of loss and love. All the main characters are seriously flawed and damaged people that because they come together (thanks to the angry Tyler) become better people and find their own reasons to truly live life (something none of them have done in years).\n\nI thought the acting was very well done. Some i have heard complain about certain scenes but truthfully, if you have ever suffered any of the losses or pains that these people have, they would realize that the actions are spot on! \n\nI am wowed by the movie, stunned truly... I am also very glad that this movie was made, not as eye candy for Pattinson but rather to show his and others talent on such a touching, difficult, and painful subject. This would not have been made if it were not for the talent in this movie that pushed for it to be made, THANK YOU!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was perhaps the glorious age for TV comedians who could count on their fame to earn ticket passes for the big screen, and while Alain Chabat's "Asterix and Cleopatra" was an exception because it was based on a classic comic-book, two movies released in 2004 proved, if it ever needed to be proved, that you can have all the stars your producers' wallet can attract, without a story, you have nothing.\n\nIt all started with the dreadful "RRRrrrr!!!", a film set in prehistoric times and whose only reason to exist was to give to TV surrealist comedic troop "Robin des Bois" (a French poor man's "Monty Python") a chance to grace the silver screen for the first time. Closer to a disgrace, it was also the last time they did a film together and only Jean-Paul Rouve grew a honorable career out of it, one he could owe to better choices and to his versatility. Chabat lost his Midas touch with "RRRrrrr!!!" but even the critical panning the film met didn't shake this craze over comic-books. The year would see the release of "Iznogoud" and "The Daltons", both based on René Goscinny's iconic characters, and both starring TV stars: Michaël Youn for the former and the 'Eric and Ramzy' duo for the latter.\n\nAnd both have in common that they would make Goscinny roll over his grave or die of a heart stroke if he was still alive, as the stories are just excuses for actors to play their usual shtick under the fallacious homage pretext. We're supposed to laugh when Youn gets excited as when Ramzy acts stupid in "The Daltons" and makes Joe angry, that's it. It's like sitcom humor elevated to the status of cinematic art form, with the complicity of greedy producers who know how to disguise mediocrity under high production values. Because unfortunately, what these films have in common is that they look good and professional enough to fool the viewers, but that's the only luxury they couldn't not afford.\n\nSo, "The Daltons" is about one of the most iconic creations of the late Goscinny and Morris, the four brothers whose escalating heights and contrasting personalities between the small short-tempered leader Joe and the tall but lovably stupid Averell contributed to some of the best pages of Lucky Luke and French-Belgian comic-books. If that relationship worked in the film, you had your film, and why shouldn't it have worked? Eric and Ramzy have proved themselves capable to play duos with contrasting personalities, Eric is talented enough to play the angry one, and Ramzy to be stupid, and I'm sure they grew up reading Lucky Luke like I did. But making a character likable isn't as easy as it sounds, and that was Goscinny's strongest suit, making villainous or stupid characters irresistibly funny.\n\nIndeed, while Averell in the book is stupid, it's an endearing form of stupidity, we're supposed to laugh because it makes Joe angry, the problem in the film is that Averell is so stupid and oblivious to his own stupidity that it makes us angry. I lost patience so many times I couldn't wait for Joe to smack his face, and throws himself in a ravine after that. It's one thing not to stand characters but not when you have to deal with them every time. There's not one ounce of likability in the four of them, one is an autistic imbecile, another one is a sociopathic maniac, and the two others are such worthless plot-fillers they even got the names wrong, Jack was supposed to be William and vice-versa. So, I'm not even sure anyone involved in the writing really took time to read Lucky Luke.\n\nWell I did read the books and being a fan, when the film started, I really gave it the benefit of the doubt, making bandits comical isn't the most difficult task to achieve, there have been comical hold-ups in the history of cinema and hilariously stupid guys, so the film couldn't really miss its target. I could close my eyes on the random addition of Ma Dalton (voiced by Marthe Villalonga, the typecast Jewish-mother of French cinema) but I knew it was going downhill when my ears caught these two words: magical hat. In the obligatory random cameo-moment, the Daltons' cellmate played by Kad Merad reveals the existence of a hat that turns you into a bullet-proof human even if Lucky Luke is the shooter. Lucky Luke's adventures never indulged to Fantasy or Sci-fi so it's not good when the script relies on such desperate tricks.\n\nThere were countless possibilities to make the movie work, hell, there was a simple one: just adapt one of the twenty stories featuring the Daltons, Goscinny's humor can't fail. No they had to come up with a lousy magical hat. I wish it was big enough so they could all hide under it, a pitiful excuse to use CGI, while it only worked for the shadows' gags of Lucky Luke, it was totally overplayed with the hat. And you know there's something wrong when Lucky Luke, played by a convincing Till Schweiger, is the funniest character in the film. Eric and Ramzy suffer from the same syndrome as the Robin des Bois, their appeal is limited to sketch or sitcom format, one movie wouldn't be strong enough to sustain their comical 'talent'.\n\nAnd I remember "The Daltons" was the first movie I reviewed in a post after I had registered on IMDb, I did it in French because the film had infuriated me so much I felt the need to vent my anger in my mother-tongue. I'm not so surprised the post is still there 12 years after, it's not like people have been watching it ever since. Good, such an atrocity didn't deserve to become a classic.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3407,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.3},"genre":["Comedy","Western"],"datePublished":"2004-12-08","keywords":"19th century,street shootout,cowboy,based on comic book,based on graphic novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1964883481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNhOTE3MmYtYWIzNS00N2Y1LWFhNTAtYjdlM2VlYjA2NTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNhOTE3MmYtYWIzNS00N2Y1LWFhNTAtYjdlM2VlYjA2NTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431956/","name":"Eric Judor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0066080/","name":"Ramzy Bedia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785647/","name":"Saïd Serrari"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0372072/","name":"Philippe Haïm"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051581/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080776/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0066080/","name":"Ramzy Bedia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0371890/","name":"Michel Hazanavicius"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431956/","name":"Eric Judor"}],"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This TV show is pulled by an awesome production design, supported by so many accurate details and problems which existed one hundred years ago. But this doesn't prevent the whole job to be messy, with no control of the story, a scheme where you have the feeling that are too much ingredients: crime, politics, drama, thriller, romance, comedy. The creator himself admitted to have insisted on the purpose to please ANYONE, to reach the largest audiences. I won't compare this strategy with CASA DEL PAPEL crap, though I perfectly could after all, but as I have already said, I hate this kind of point of view, reaching the largest audiences, because the result is not always the quality of the show. So, if you want to learn about French politics of the early 1900's, that OK, that's definitely for you. To summarize, that remains French on the shape, BUT not on the background, NOT on the message: to teach modern audiences what the politics of those years were.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":367,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I want to start off with the Pilot. When I first saw it, I had a lot of problems with it. It was messy, and some of the characters were dumb, and some of the acting was corny. However, after the Pilot ended, I realized just how intrigued I was by it. It sure was a messy Pilot, but that's the beauty of it. It was always moving, it wasn't your typical slow-paced suspense show. \n\nIn fact, that pretty much sums up the whole season. This is a crackling, fast-paced and entertaining horror series. I would never call this high- art, but that's what makes it great. The show doesn't take itself seriously at all, and it always remains fun, even when it's silly, and yet you get really invested in the story lines and characters. Sure, the performances are flawed at times, and the writing and directing awkward, but the fast pace in every episode doesn't ever let the viewer gasp for air. This is the true definition of a thrill ride. It also feels very experimental. It executes a lot of things in very unordinary ways, in ways that no other TV show does. It doesn't always succeed, but even when it doesn't, you can appreciate it. \n\nYour friends might call The Walking Dead the better horror show, but I disagree. As far as Pilots go, no matter how entertaining or thrilling American Horror Story's Pilot was, the Pilot for The Walking Dead was better, masterful in every way. Since then, it's merely a good, sometimes great, TV show. It takes itself more seriously and is slower-paced, but it's problem is that a lot of times the writing just feels stale, recycled. You are intrigued by it, but it sometimes feels weaker than it should be. And the fact that it takes itself too seriously sort of dampens the fun one should be having with it, simply because its writing isn't strong enough to stretch out its story lines (like the two best TV shows on air, Mad Men and Breaking Bad, do). American Horror Story is better for these reasons- each episode by itself is exciting, it's always moving, and instead of trying to slow things down and makes its flaws more apparent, it even overdoes things on purpose. Messy, sure, silly, sometimes, but overall more intriguing, funner, and more exciting. I cannot wait for the second season of this, since I thought the resolution to the story of the first season was excellent, as well as the final shot. \n\nP.S. Oh, I also want to add another note to take. The performances do hit their great marks, but the only truly incredible performance is Jessica Lange. Her character and performance makes all other supporting turns in television look stale by comparison, and all of her scenes are truly gold! She needs to win that Emmy next year! I want to see her back!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":288753,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-10-05","keywords":"anthology,male objectification,infidelity,supernatural,serial murder","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000870/","name":"Kathy Bates","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000291/","name":"Angela Bassett"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060381/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314634/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0156994/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1004299/","name":"Brad Falchuk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614682/","name":"Ryan Murphy"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Part 1: Red Tide - Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3243294745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBmNjJmM2EtMTA4NC00YTg2LWJkY2UtZmRkZDc4YTdmMTA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBmNjJmM2EtMTA4NC00YTg2LWJkY2UtZmRkZDc4YTdmMTA0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Your first taste.

It's less successful when it comes to the somewhat heavy-handed dialogue sequences and the largely wooden performance of its lead, Renzo Ricci as Garibaldi.\n\nLike Visconit's "The Leopard" it was fundamentally butchered by its American distributors who cut the film, dubbed it, consequently altering Rossellini's message but they couldn't alter the look of the film; visually this is one of the most beautiful of all Rossellini's work and its recent rediscovery is certainly welcome.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":386,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1961-02-02","keywords":"sicily invasion,nationalist,invasion,killing civilians,garibaldi","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0723242/","name":"Renzo Ricci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0832375/","name":"Paolo Stoppa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0409421/","name":"Franco Interlenghi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744023/","name":"Roberto Rossellini"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039837/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026813/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051441/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024847/","name":"Sergio Amidei","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0678374/","name":"Antonio Petrucci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0019530/","name":"Carlo Alianello"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Maybe I was over-prepared (Hey, it took me a second viewing of 'Citizen Kane' to get my past pre-set expectations!). But while I could see why M*A*S*H was groundbreaking and important for a Hollywood film of it's day (lack of the usual clear narrative line, anti-war stance, overlapping, improvised dialogue, sexuality, bloody operating room scenes serving as ironic counterpart, etc), it felt pretty dated and unfocused. There are some very funny moments, but a lot of the ironies seem easy, and there's a lack of a true darker underpinnings and ideas, unlike, say, 'Dr. Strangelove'. \n\nA lot of the humor is juvenile, cruel and silly. And while I get that's the point – nothing can be more deeply juvenile, cruel and silly than war, it got repetitive and heavy handed after a while.

Maybe I was over-prepared (Hey, it took me a second viewing of 'Citizen Kane' to get my past pre-set expectations!). But while I could see why M*A*S*H was groundbreaking and important for a Hollywood film of it's day (lack of the usual clear narrative line, anti-war stance, overlapping, improvised dialogue, sexuality, bloody operating room scenes serving as ironic counterpart, etc), it felt pretty dated and unfocused. There are some very funny moments, but a lot of the ironies seem easy, and there's a lack of a true darker underpinnings and ideas, unlike, say, 'Dr. Strangelove'. \n\nA lot of the humor is juvenile, cruel and silly. And while I get that's the point – nothing can be more deeply juvenile, cruel and silly than war, it got repetitive and heavy handed after a while. The performances are good, but beyond Robert Duvall, none of the characters have much in the way of dimensions.

I had heard of Yasujiro Ozu's "Tokyo Story" for several years but never had an opportunity to see it until Criterion resuscitated it as part of their DVD collection. Over fifty years old, this wondrous 1953 film resonates just as deeply today. Those outside Japan rarely get to see a Japanese film classic that doesn't involve samurai warriors in medieval battles. This one, however, is a subtly observed family drama set in post-WWII Japan, and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of Ozu's film-making style that makes this among the most moving of films.\n\nThe plot centers on Shukishi and Tomi, an elderly couple, who traverse the country from their southern fishing village of Onomichi to visit their adult children, daughter Shige and son Koichi, in Tokyo. Leading their own busy lives, the children realize their obligation to entertain them and pack them off to Atami, a nearby resort targeted to weekend revelers. Returning to Tokyo unexpectedly, Tomi visits their kindly daughter-in-law, Noriko, the widow of second son Shoji, while Shukishi gets drunk with some old companions. The old couple realizes they have become a burden to their children and decide to return to Onomichi. They also have a younger daughter Kyoko, a schoolteacher who lives with them, and younger son Keizo works for the train company in Osaka. By now the children, except for Kyoko and the dutiful Noriko, have given up on their parents, even when Tomi takes ill in Osaka on the way back home. From this seemingly convoluted, trivial-sounding storyline, fraught with soap opera possibilities, Ozu has fashioned a heartfelt and ultimately ironic film that focuses on the details in people's lives rather than a single dramatic situation.\n\nWhat fascinates me about Ozu's idiosyncratic style is how he relies on insinuation to carry his story forward. In fact, some of the more critical events happen off-camera because Ozu's simple, penetrating observations of these characters' lives remain powerfully insightful without being contrived. Ozu scholar David Desser, who provides insightful commentary on the alternate audio track, explains this concept as "narrative ellipses", Ozu's singularly effective means of providing emotional continuity to a story without providing all the predictable detail in between. Ozu also positions his camera low throughout his film to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. It adds significantly to the humanity he evokes. There are no melodramatic confrontations among the characters, no masochistic showboating, and the dialogue is deceptively casual, as even the most off-hand remark bears weight into the story. The film condemns no one and its sense of inevitability carries with it only certain resigned sadness. What amazes me most is how the ending is so cathartic because the characters feel so real to me, not because there are manipulative plot developments, even death, which force me to feel for them.\n\nI just love the performances, as they have a neo-realism that makes them all the more affecting. Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama are wonderfully authentic as Shukishi and Tomi, perfectly conveying the resignation they feel about their lives and their children without slipping into cheap sentimentality. Higashiyama effortlessly displays the sunny demeanor of a grandmother, so when sadness does take over in her life, it becomes all the more haunting. In particular, she has a beautiful scene where Tomi looks forlornly at her grandchild wondering what he will be when he grows up and whether she will live to see what happens. Even more heartbreaking is the scene where Shukishi and Tomi sit in Ueno Park realizing their children have no time for them and are resigned to the fact that they need to find a place to sleep for the night. The closest the film has to a villain is Shige, portrayed fearlessly by Haruko Sugimura, who is able to show respect, pettiness and conniving in a realistically mercurial fashion. Watch her as she complains about the expensive cakes her husband bought for her parents (as she selfishly eats them herself) or how she finagles Koichi to co-finance the trip to Atami or how she shows her frustration when her parents come home early from the spa. So Yamamura (familiar to later Western audiences as Admiral Yamamoto in "Tora! Tora! Tora!") displays the right amount of indifference as Koichi, and Kyoko Kagawa has a few sharp lines toward the end of the film as the disappointed Kyoko.\n\nBut the best performance comes from the legendary Setsuko Hara, a luminous actress whose beauty and sensitivity remind me of Olivia de Havilland during the same era. As Noriko, she is breathtaking in showing her character's modesty, her unforced generosity in spite of her downscale status and her constant smile as a mask for her pain. She has a number of deeply affecting moments, for instance, when Noriko explains to Shukishi and Tomi how she misses her husband, even though it is implied he was a brutalizing alcoholic; or the touching goodbye to Kyoko; or her pained embarrassment over the high esteem that Shukishi holds for her kindness. Don't expect fireworks or any shocking moments, just a powerfully emotional film in spite of its seemingly modest approach. The two-disc DVD set has the commentary from Desser on the first disc, as well as the trailer. On the second disc, there are two excellent documentaries. One is a comprehensive 1983, two-hour feature focused on Ozu's life and career, and the second is a 40-minute tribute from several international movie directors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57009,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1953-11-03","keywords":"estrangement,family reunion,post world war two,japanese,generation gap","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2320022553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNGEwMTctYjgwZC00ZTMyLTk4MTMtNjA5MjQwNWMxMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNGEwMTctYjgwZC00ZTMyLTk4MTMtNjA5MjQwNWMxMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753479/","name":"Chishû Ryû"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383261/","name":"Chieko Higashiyama"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0945522/","name":"Sô Yamamura"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654868/","name":"Yasujirô Ozu"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007001/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0633792/","name":"Kôgo Noda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654868/","name":"Yasujirô Ozu"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It had been one of the scandalous, passionate, and morbid stories of the interwar period, a story that competed on the front pages of Parisian newspapers in 1933 with the news about Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, and which had divided the French public opinion into two camps, as no another sensational affair had since the Dreyfus case. The heroine of the gloomy story was a 16-year-old girl from a working / mid-class neighborhood, who had poisoned her parents. The father had died but the mother survived.

The script is quite faithful to the story, presents the facts as reported by the press of the time and does not try to serve surprises or insert speculative interpretations about the reasons for the actions and the psychological sources of the acts committed by the young woman. The director's attention is focused on reconstructing the confined and devoid of personal separation in which the Noziere family lives, the bohemian environment in which the young high school girl spends her time in the company of students, crooks, and old bourgeois who take advantage of the youth of girls in need for money or sensations. Rejecting both moral judgments and psychoanalytic interpretations, Chabrol lets Isabelle Huppert build the role of the girl who, instead of teenage dreams, plunges into promiscuity, and who travels from adolescent rebellion to murder with an impassive coldness. We don't find too many reasons in the film that would put us as spectators in the camp of Violette's supporters, except for the personality of the actress who fills the role with gloomy feelings and self-destructive tension.\n\nIsabelle Huppert achieves with the part of Violette in this film one of the first great roles of a fabulous career. She is supported by Stéphane Audran (the director's second wife, whom he would break up after 14 years of marriage and many remarkable films in the same year 1978) and Jean Carmet, one of those talented French actors whom Chabrol was giving the opportunity of consistent parts even if they were not first rank stars. A special award should be given to those who recognize Fabrice Luchini in one of the first roles of his film career. The style of the story is interesting and elaborate, temporally separated frames continue visually one another, flashbacks and imaginary scenes (especially from Violetta's fantasies or nightmares) are interleaved nervously and non-linearly, but perfectly following the logic of the action. 'Violette Noziere' manages to describe the interwar social environment, with social contradictions, moral prejudices, inequalities and stigmas related to the status of women and the pressure of the press of sensation. The film also intents to be a psychological study into the motives of the crime. Here, I think intentionally, the answer is not clear. We are shown the conditions that can generate crime, but not the gates that open between reality and horror. Judgments belong to us, the spectators.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2246,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1978-05-24","keywords":"teenage girl,male frontal nudity,male nudity,reference to louis xvi,reference to the dreyfus affair","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000804/","name":"Stéphane Audran"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0138405/","name":"Jean Carmet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001031/","name":"Claude Chabrol"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015884/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061460/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060193/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0058286/","name":"Odile Barski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111302/","name":"Hervé Bromberger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0340190/","name":"Frédéric Grendel"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It had been one of the scandalous, passionate, and morbid stories of the interwar period, a story that competed on the front pages of Parisian newspapers in 1933 with the news about Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, and which had divided the French public opinion into two camps, as no another sensational affair had since the Dreyfus case. The heroine of the gloomy story was a 16-year-old girl from a working / mid-class neighborhood, who had poisoned her parents. The father had died but the mother survived. The investigation revealed the double life of a girl suffocated by the environment in which she lived, considered a sinister criminal by some and a victim of social conditions and a perverse family environment by others. However, Chabrol only mentions in passing the media scandal around this case, being rather fascinated by the young woman's personality and also fascinating his spectators in the way he tells the story of the crime and the circumstances that led to its committing.\n\nThe whole film revolves around the heroine played by Isabelle Huppert.

These people are more snobs than not, but they are often decent snobs, good friends to one another in a tight spot, and carry themselves with a kind of quiet dignity that seems to have died with the empire. There are some fine performances aside from Miss Davis', notably from James Stevenson as her lawyer, who yet seems to be her lover, but isn't; and Herbert Marshall, who may as well her lawyer but is in fact her husband.

The supporting cast is also quite good if more generalized in their characterizations, more a fault of the screenplay than the performers. There is one especially fine supporting performance from Lionel Jeffries as the maniacal Lord Queensbury. Jeffries plays Queensbury as a crazed brute, a type of man we can no longer countenance in these days, though I suspect they are still out there waiting for their chance to pounce on those who they fear and do not understand.\n\nSonia Dresdel is Lady Wilde, Oscar's dotty mother at the end of her life. It's a small part but is quietly powerful. Other people in Wilde's life, Constance, his wife, and Ada Leverson, his stalwart friend and life-long supporter, are tantalizingly glimpsed but little is revealed of their inner workings. But this isn't a film about them but about the actual trials and much of the film is spent in courtrooms. This might sound boring but it isn't.\n\nJames Mason appears in the first trial as the defending witness, for Lord Queensbury, and a more vicious, narrow-minded lawyer could hardly be found, even these days.\n\nThe technical credits are competent if nothing special; the music, melodramatic in a soap-opera-ish way, the sets plush and too clean. But somehow the power and tragedy of Wilde's story comes through all the gilding of the script, peppered with some of Wilde's wiser quotes, well-placed, naturally, in the text. There is nothing preachy or moralistic which is a relief, compared to the highly politicized scripts being written since this film was made.\n\nIt is interesting to note Nicholas Roeg as the camera operator. He wasn't the cinematographer but I detected a few Roeg-ish touches in a couple of the more meditative scenes.\n\nThis is not a film to be sluffed off as old-fashioned simply because there are no sex scenes or vulgar language or violence. The psychic violence suffered by Oscar Wilde was quite sufficient enough and this is a memorable film, worth having in the collection."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":888,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"keywords":"homophobia,homosexual history,based on true story,oscar wilde character,lord alfred douglas character","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002075/","name":"Peter Finch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593814/","name":"Yvonne Mitchell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000051/","name":"James Mason"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400731/","name":"Ken Hughes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103268/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103296/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400731/","name":"Ken Hughes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0405007/","name":"Montgomery Hyde"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0299019/","name":"John Furnell"}],"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The supporting cast is also quite good if more generalized in their characterizations, more a fault of the screenplay than the performers. There is one especially fine supporting performance from Lionel Jeffries as the maniacal Lord Queensbury. Jeffries plays Queensbury as a crazed brute, a type of man we can no longer countenance in these days, though I suspect they are still out there waiting for their chance to pounce on those who they fear and do not understand.\n\nSonia Dresdel is Lady Wilde, Oscar's dotty mother at the end of her life. It's a small part but is quietly powerful. Other people in Wilde's life, Constance, his wife, and Ada Leverson, his stalwart friend and life-long supporter, are tantalizingly glimpsed but little is revealed of their inner workings. But this isn't a film about them but about the actual trials and much of the film is spent in courtrooms. This might sound boring but it isn't.\n\nJames Mason appears in the first trial as the defending witness, for Lord Queensbury, and a more vicious, narrow-minded lawyer could hardly be found, even these days.\n\nThe technical credits are competent if nothing special; the music, melodramatic in a soap-opera-ish way, the sets plush and too clean. But somehow the power and tragedy of Wilde's story comes through all the gilding of the script, peppered with some of Wilde's wiser quotes, well-placed, naturally, in the text. There is nothing preachy or moralistic which is a relief, compared to the highly politicized scripts being written since this film was made.\n\nIt is interesting to note Nicholas Roeg as the camera operator. He wasn't the cinematographer but I detected a few Roeg-ish touches in a couple of the more meditative scenes.\n\nThis is not a film to be sluffed off as old-fashioned simply because there are no sex scenes or vulgar language or violence. The psychic violence suffered by Oscar Wilde was quite sufficient enough and this is a memorable film, worth having in the collection.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":888,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"keywords":"homophobia,homosexual history,based on true story,oscar wilde character,lord alfred douglas character","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002075/","name":"Peter Finch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593814/","name":"Yvonne Mitchell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000051/","name":"James Mason"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400731/","name":"Ken Hughes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103268/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103296/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400731/","name":"Ken Hughes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0405007/","name":"Montgomery Hyde","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0299019/","name":"John Furnell"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I remember liking the opening sequence and thinking the rest was an empty bore. Well, it's no longer a bore to me, at 36, and it's far from empty, but it's still not the masterpiece to me that it seems to be to most film fans.\n\nThe coolest thing about 8 1/2 is the way that it's clearly a film about the film itself... a film about a filmmaker who is making a film, whose analysis of the film he's working on is actually an analysis of the film you are watching - as you're watching it. Conceptually, it's brilliant - and it does do a very good job of making these layered themes work. However, it's simply not that exciting to watch overall - at nearly 2 1/2 hours, it is a bit of a challenge to enjoy all the way through. The movie somehow manages to simultaneously have so much going on, and still feel like so little is going on, for a great quantity of the run time. There are definitely some really phenomenal sequences - plenty of surrealism, often in visuals and sometimes in performance and dialogue. It's never DULL, but it's also not much fun.\n\nTo be honest, considering one of the over-arching themes is "infatuation with women", it's kind of ironic that the movie does not feature more memorable female characters. There's only one who's iconic but that's because her character represents "the devil" and she's only in a couple of quick scenes. Then, there's the stunning Claudia Cardinale who gets top billing but is actually only in about 1.5 scenes - and her primary scene is a very important one, one of the most important thematically, but, we don't really get much of HER from it. The rest just kind of redundantly trail off in nags throughout the movie - intentionally, but, it doesn't leave you with much.

I remember liking the opening sequence and thinking the rest was an empty bore. Well, it's no longer a bore to me, at 36, and it's far from empty, but it's still not the masterpiece to me that it seems to be to most film fans.\n\nThe coolest thing about 8 1/2 is the way that it's clearly a film about the film itself... a film about a filmmaker who is making a film, whose analysis of the film he's working on is actually an analysis of the film you are watching - as you're watching it. Conceptually, it's brilliant - and it does do a very good job of making these layered themes work. However, it's simply not that exciting to watch overall - at nearly 2 1/2 hours, it is a bit of a challenge to enjoy all the way through. The movie somehow manages to simultaneously have so much going on, and still feel like so little is going on, for a great quantity of the run time. There are definitely some really phenomenal sequences - plenty of surrealism, often in visuals and sometimes in performance and dialogue. It's never DULL, but it's also not much fun.\n\nTo be honest, considering one of the over-arching themes is "infatuation with women", it's kind of ironic that the movie does not feature more memorable female characters. There's only one who's iconic but that's because her character represents "the devil" and she's only in a couple of quick scenes. Then, there's the stunning Claudia Cardinale who gets top billing but is actually only in about 1.5 scenes - and her primary scene is a very important one, one of the most important thematically, but, we don't really get much of HER from it. The rest just kind of redundantly trail off in nags throughout the movie - intentionally, but, it doesn't leave you with much. And Marcello Mastroianni's lead character Guido is a bit of a bore but he needs to be because that's kind of the point of the character. Again, it occurs with great purpose but it's simply not very entertaining to watch.\n\nIt's a complex film with a lot to offer, but not enough of what I enjoy about movies.

And when was the last time I was able to say that? A masterful achievement without concessions to the larger public who doesn't know or care about Italian politics. The film has a life of its own. It's like a Shakespearean adaptation of a modern Mephistopheles. If you don't know who Giulio Andreotti is you will want to know because it feels and looks like a fictional character.

When her opportunity arrives, she must face the rigours of the training, segregation and quarantine which hit her much harder than she had anticipated - and cause her to miss her young daughter, the rather engaging Zélie Boulant ("Stella") dreadfully. The problem with this film is that aside from some pictures of the Kazakh spaceport and some weight-water training, it could be about absolutely anything. Any mother (or, indeed father) who has to dedicate themself unconditionally to a job might reasonably feel the same senses of loneliness and despair and though Eva Green (or rather, her eyes) do manage to convey some of the sheer exhaustion her character might be feeling during this extensive period of preparation, again it could be for an ultra-marathon or a cross-channel swim! It's been a while since I've seen Matt Dillon on screen, and he adds nothing to this vanity project for polyglots.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6076,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Green plays Sarah, a French astronaut training at the European Space Agency in Cologne. The only woman in the arduous programme she has been chosen to be part of the crew of a year-long space mission called ‘Proxima’. Putting enormous strain on her relationship with her daughter (played by outstanding newcomer Zélie Boulant-Lemesle), the training begins to take its toll on both as Sarah’s training progresses and the launch looms ever closer.","datePublished":"2019-11-27","description":"An astronaut prepares for a one-year mission aboard the International Space Station.","keywords":"female astronaut,male astronaut,mother daughter relationship,cat,swimming pool","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt7374926/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"CinemaSerf","dateCreated":"2020-08-10","inLanguage":"English","name":"Uneventful and unremarkable melodrama.","reviewBody":"I was really disappointed with this rather dull, dreary documentary-style story about "Sarah" (Eva Green) who has dreamed since she was a child of going into space. When her opportunity arrives, she must face the rigours of the training, segregation and quarantine which hit her much harder than she had anticipated - and cause her to miss her young daughter, the rather engaging Zélie Boulant ("Stella") dreadfully. The problem with this film is that aside from some pictures of the Kazakh spaceport and some weight-water training, it could be about absolutely anything. Any mother (or, indeed father) who has to dedicate themself unconditionally to a job might reasonably feel the same senses of loneliness and despair and though Eva Green (or rather, her eyes) do manage to convey some of the sheer exhaustion her character might be feeling during this extensive period of preparation, again it could be for an ultra-marathon or a cross-channel swim! It's been a while since I've seen Matt Dillon on screen, and he adds nothing to this vanity project for polyglots.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6076,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As the movie opens, we get to know Tina, a Swedish Customs inspector, who happens to have an obvious facial deformity, as well as a heightened sense of smell which allows her to detect how people feel (shame, rage, fear, etc.) One day she is able to sense something on a guy, and it turns out he was hiding a memory card containing child pornography. The police are amazed at her abilities, and ask her to assist in the investigation as to who made the pornography.

Here he brings a tale to the big screen that without a doubt is the one of the most original and fantastical movies of the year, period, and I see more than 150 movies per year. Given the plot-heavy nature of the movie, I can't say a whole lot more, so you'll just have to take my word for it.

The comparison is unfair, but I can't help but think back to another Swedish movie from now already 10 years ago that also surprised us out of nowhere: "Let the Right One In". The comparison is unfair because that is a horror film, and "Border" certainly is not that. But it's the originality that strikes me as the common character in both. Beware: there are some scenes in "Border" that some people will find absolutely disturbing, if not worse. No, this movie is not for the faint-hearted, that's for sure.

As it turns out, Thursday was the last day of its limited 1 week run. I can's see this playing long in theater, and I'm also quite certain that Hollywood will not end up remaking it (as it did with "Let the Right One In"), for that "Border is just too "out there".

"The Law of the Market" emphasizes the basic inhumanity of the marketplace-driven society in which he lives.\n\nVincent Lindon plays Thierry Taugourdeau, who has lost his skilled labor job because of a factory closure. (Other displaced workers want to sue the company for pulling out of France to go elsewhere. Apparently, this isn't legal if the company is making a profit in France. However, Thierry isn't interested.)\n\nThierry is accustomed to getting a good salary in a respected job. As the film opens, we learn that he has taken a three-month course in order to learn how to be a crane operator. He informs the government employment counselor that the course was worthless. Companies will only employ crane operators that are already experienced construction workers. Why did they advise him to take a course that couldn't lead to employment?\n\nThe film continues in the same vein. Thierry truly wants to work to support himself, his wife, and his son with cerebral palsy. (The son is portrayed by Matthieu Schaller, who does indeed have cerebral palsy.)\n\nWe follow Thierry from frustration to frustration as nothing he does brings him employment. Finally, he obtains employment, and that is where the measure of a man begins.\n\nThis is a fascinating--but painful--movie to watch. We're accustomed to unhappy stories in which the protagonists are down-and-out, and the situation is hopeless. This plot doesn't fit into that mold. Thierry has had a comfortable, middle-class life. He's intelligent and resourceful. Even so, he can't counter the forces of society that tell him that he and his family have to move down a notch--or more--in order to survive.\n\nVincent Lindon is brilliant in this role. We can identify with him and it is not a comfortable feeling. Lindon won the Best Actor award at Cannes for this portrayal, and I'm not surprised. It's worth seeing this film just for an opportunity to watch a superb actor succeeding in a difficult role.\n\nWe saw this film in the excellent Dryden Theatre in Rochester's George Eastman Museum. It was shown a part of the outstanding Rochester Labor Film Series. \n\nFor reasons I don't understand, this movie has a dismal IMDb rating of 6.8. Possibly, reviewers found it simply too depressing. Yes, it's depressing, but it reflects reality, and I think it's definitely worth seeking out. It's available on DVD and Blu-Ray. It's too important a film to miss.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5928,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-05-19","keywords":"supermarket,working class,france,trailer camp,campground","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"La loi du marché (The Measure of a Man)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2223026201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MDMzMTc2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA3MTQ2NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MDMzMTc2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA3MTQ2NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Full trailer for La loi du marché (The Measure of a Man) in French."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0512071/","name":"Vincent Lindon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7379140/","name":"Karine de Mirbeck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7379141/","name":"Matthieu Schaller"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0110300/","name":"Stéphane Brizé"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085679/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0110300/","name":"Stéphane Brizé"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0329825/","name":"Olivier Gorce"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Une femme française: Directed by Régis Wargnier. With Emmanuelle Béart, Daniel Auteuil, Gabriel Barylli, Jean-Claude Brialy. Wed just as war breaks out, Jeanne hardly gets to know her military husband, Louis, before the debacle of 1940. While waiting for his return from a POW camp, Jeanne journeys through countless affairs with Louis' comrades- in-arms. Hoping to forget these wartime betrayls, Louis takes his wife and the infant twins he didn't father to Berlin, where she falls for Matthais, a sensitive German industrialist. When the Indochinese war sends Louis to Vietnam, Matthais follows Jeanne back to France. A subsequent move to Damascus where Louis is posted as military attache, fails to break their bond." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0114790/","name":"Une femme française","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTI4MWI1NTMtZTMyZC00ZmJmLTg2N2EtN2U5NzNjYTMzNTQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjQzMzQzODY@._V1_.jpg","description":"Wed just as war breaks out, Jeanne hardly gets to know her military husband, Louis, before the debacle of 1940.

All of these films share the same basic formula of 4 or 5 seemingly unrelated stories that ultimately converge on a particular holiday in a big city. If you're familiar with Gary Marshall's illustrious career including iconic films like "Pretty Woman" (1990) and going all the way back to 70s TV with "Happy Days" and "Laverne &amp; Shirley" (and yes! He is married to Penny "Laverne" Marshall who makes a brief but funny cameo in this movie), then you know basically what to expect: good clean fun that won't necessarily change your life or fix the ozone layer, but it's great entertainment for a night. Eeeh slightly on the sappy/predictable side, but heck, what do you expect from a PG-13 movie?\n\nAs with Marshall's other films, the appeal lies largely in a superstar studded cast. Robert De Niro, Halle Berry, Ashton Kutcher, Hilary Swank, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jon Bon Jovi (wait... Who?), and buckets of cameos like James Belushi, Ludicrous (argh, IMDb's auto spell checker keeps messing up the spelling), Cary Elwes and Alyssa Milano whose scene actually got cut. However my biggest criticism is that, by splitting the screen time between so many show-stealers in so many little segments, nobody really gets a chance to shine. And for example you may be a little annoyed that a master thespian like Robert De Niro is on screen for only a combined 10 minutes, if even that. Thus, the big names come across as somewhat gimmicky.\n\nMy next biggest criticism is that the jokes and gags weren't that great. At times it felt like the movie was trying too hard to make a lukewarm joke work. You know, like when you start to tell a lame joke at the office water cooler, then in your mind you realize how lame it is, so you try to dramatize it with flourishes and big arm gestures. Yeah because that always works. Not that I do that. Much.\n\nBut then you realize that this really is a tale in the tradition of 70s sitcom, predictable, slightly flat, but with its own distinct style that might make you catch yourself grinning.\n\nGary, if you're out there reading this (yeah because award winning Hollywood directors like to waste their time trolling internet movie sites), I'd like to suggest that the darker, edgier segments work best. For example Ashton Kutcher (whom I normally don't care for) played an excellent role as a misanthropic hipster poseur, sort of a modern day scrooge, who spends his time tearing down party decorations in his apartment building. Most of the other segments were a bit too chipper, and thus they suffered from lack of humorous irony, which, ask Mel Brooks, is important in comedy. Of course, the most important thing in comedy is... well...

(insert big arm gesture) ...you know... like... timing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A washed out burnt down Chef has cleaned up, buffed his act up, and put himself together in an endeavour to pursue perfection. He is reaching out for a third Michelin star and anything less would end up getting burnt by his wrath.\n\nSo we know how recalcitrant chefs are. Seen enough Gordon Ramsay to reach that conclusion. Bradley as Adam Jones touches that nerve wrecking breakdown to achieve what he has planned to do. He shouts, despises, scorns and insults his crew to get their juices running. He doesn't care how evil he might look or sound while trying to get results. He is unaffected by emotions, reckless with his life but careful with the food he is preparing. If his preparation doesn't meet the standard in his head, he flings it away and doesn't even hold himself from bashing it to the wall. \n\nHe might be a man with a mission, but he is arrogant, mean and a heartless prick. He is also in a huge drug debt which gawks him from a distance, and occasionally batters him up good. He is trying hard to reach it, and there is always someone or something that messes him up and compels him to start at Ground Zero. \n\nWhat is quite interesting to watch is the brilliant presentation of its frames. The food shown in Burnt will at once make you hungry. There are great close up shots that will sizzle your palates. But everything disappears leaving you wanting for more. Also, there isn't one great recipe that is highlighted marvelously or shown being cooked proper which will bum foodies out. The story lacks substance which is sad. Screenplay of the flick is good. The score is kind of okay, but could have used some more depth. \n\nCooper fans are gonna love him in this new avatar. His acting is still very engaging. His dramatic bits are great to watch and Siena Miller complements him yet again quite beautifully. Daniel Bruhl plays Tony beautifully too. Emma Thompson has been given some marvelous lines, while Alicia Vikander has kind of a cameo in there. \n\nRemember the golden rule to truly enjoy anything: Don't compare! Burnt shouldn't be compared with other similar culinary movies in the library and you might relish it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":109190,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Jean (Pio Marmaï) left his family home ten years ago. When father falls ill, he returns and reunites with his sister Juliette (Ana Girardot) and brother Jérémie (François Civil), to sort out stuff between them. Ah  families. Their problems and conflicts seem very important for themselves, but are often difficult to understand for bystanders. This is also true for writer-director Cédric Klapisch's latest, slow-burning but quite nice drama about the importance of family and the power of forgiving. The short summary feels sugary, and Klapisch does aim for feel-good, but the movie does not try to manipulate with audience in any tasteless way. It is actually realistic depiction of well-behaved and intelligent family's life, where everybody has their problems but these are not solved in overtly dramatic way often expected from family sagas. This subtle approach doesn't make for very engaging drama, but the feel-good factor is important part of the movie. If you care to invest yourself in these characters' lives, you will probably feel like a part of their group in their end. Which is the best thing this kind of movie can ask for. One can also learn quite a lot about making and appreciating wine. 113 minutes makes it rather long watch, it's not a standout work but quietly confident and satisfying. I don't like international and also Estonian title Back to Burgundy" (Tagasi Burgundiasse") which is not as eloquent as the original – directly translated What Links Us" (Mis meid seob"). But you would have to watch the movie to care about this, I guess.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4376,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-06-14","keywords":"father son relationship,strong women,vineyard,brother sister relationship,brother brother relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Back to Burgundy","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2620635161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY3NjRjODAtOTU5NS00OWE0LWIzOGQtMDAxODgwMGUzM2Q2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY3NjRjODAtOTU5NS00OWE0LWIzOGQtMDAxODgwMGUzM2Q2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2847812/","name":"Pio Marmaï"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320759/","name":"Ana Girardot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2476624/","name":"François Civil"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458251/","name":"Cédric Klapisch"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458251/","name":"Cédric Klapisch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024887/","name":"Santiago Amigorena"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0745694/","name":"Jean-Marc Roulot"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Jean (Pio Marmaï) left his family home ten years ago. When father falls ill, he returns and reunites with his sister Juliette (Ana Girardot) and brother Jérémie (François Civil), to sort out stuff between them. Ah  families. Their problems and conflicts seem very important for themselves, but are often difficult to understand for bystanders. This is also true for writer-director Cédric Klapisch's latest, slow-burning but quite nice drama about the importance of family and the power of forgiving. The short summary feels sugary, and Klapisch does aim for feel-good, but the movie does not try to manipulate with audience in any tasteless way. It is actually realistic depiction of well-behaved and intelligent family's life, where everybody has their problems but these are not solved in overtly dramatic way often expected from family sagas. This subtle approach doesn't make for very engaging drama, but the feel-good factor is important part of the movie. If you care to invest yourself in these characters' lives, you will probably feel like a part of their group in their end. Which is the best thing this kind of movie can ask for. One can also learn quite a lot about making and appreciating wine. 113 minutes makes it rather long watch, it's not a standout work but quietly confident and satisfying. I don't like international and also Estonian title Back to Burgundy" (Tagasi Burgundiasse") which is not as eloquent as the original – directly translated What Links Us" (Mis meid seob"). But you would have to watch the movie to care about this, I guess.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4376,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-06-14","keywords":"father son relationship,strong women,vineyard,brother sister relationship,brother brother relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Back to Burgundy","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2620635161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY3NjRjODAtOTU5NS00OWE0LWIzOGQtMDAxODgwMGUzM2Q2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY3NjRjODAtOTU5NS00OWE0LWIzOGQtMDAxODgwMGUzM2Q2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2847812/","name":"Pio Marmaï","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320759/","name":"Ana Girardot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2476624/","name":"François Civil"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458251/","name":"Cédric Klapisch"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458251/","name":"Cédric Klapisch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024887/","name":"Santiago Amigorena","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0745694/","name":"Jean-Marc Roulot"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But the least glorious part of his job is that he doesn't sign them when these books are published. As he's hired to write the life of a famous football player, Kevin (Clovis Cornillac), he discovers that the latter's girlfriend is one of his old loves! With the indecision that best characterizes him, he tries to win her back while jeopardizing both his relationship with his current girlfriend Muriel and his work for the football player.\n\nThe thing that seduced me the most in this droll comedy as one could wish, although the director Laurent Tirard inserted melancholic moments which never break the tone and the storytelling of the film is the things Raphaël and Kevin say about books dealing with celebrities. These books are written with short sentences and when the publication of one of these books is announced, it is bound to become a best-seller. And of course, in this film it will happen. These details are minor but when they surface, one can't help but smile listening to them. Everything revolving around them rings true as well as some aspects of Raphaël's job.

With his undetermined look, his inability to properly take a decision and assume it to the end, his awkward approach, Edouard Baer is a major asset for Tirard's film. He was the ideal man for this role unlike Claude Miller's versatile "Betty Fisher et Autres Histoires" (2001). And the direction of actors doesn't lie fallow. I was very taken with Marie-Josée Croze and the formidable sincerity she gave to her character Muriel. Clovis Cornillac is also well served with his football player Kevin who is as uncertain as Raphaël but on another basis. He doesn't know which style to confer to his biography! Why not "à la Charles Baudelaire"? Unless another idea comes to his mind...\n\nThe film showcases a scene which sums up best Raphaël's antsy state of mind: he's in his car on a street of Paris. The lights turn green but he doesn't move off and starts to cry. Not only because of Jeff's death but also because of the ghost life he leads in which he acts an impostor. It's high time he set out his stalls and a chain of unexpected events will unconsciously steer him towards his real direction...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1594,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-09-08","keywords":"self discovery,romantic rivalry,pregnancy,narrative,ghost writer","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046347/","name":"Edouard Baer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0189887/","name":"Marie-Josée Croze"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180404/","name":"Clovis Cornillac"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016687/","name":"Laurent Tirard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037192/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016687/","name":"Laurent Tirard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0897065/","name":"Grégoire Vigneron"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Seven years later, he finally returns, and with The Descendants, he returns with a bang.\n\nLike Sideways, his screenplay (co-written by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash) nails the tone right on the head. It has to balance out three tricky narratives in the film (Matt King's self-crisis, his comatose wife's affair with another man before her boating accident, and a land deal he's reported to make), and without the proper guidance it needed, along with Payne's own confidant direction, it could have faltered. Thankfully, it balances out heavy themes and complicated emotions in uncommon detail.\n\nThe characters in this movie are many, complicated, and sorrowful in their own unique ways. Matt King was a perfect role for George Clooney. He keeps his composure, but we can still see a very heavy, filtered sorrow beneath the surface. Shailene Woodley's character (Woodley, by the way, gives one of the year's best performances) begins with a rebellious, even angry sadness, but we can see her develop over the course of the film, gaining a strong maturity beyond her years. Judy Greer and Robert Forster are each given a few spare scenes, and they make every second of their screen time count.\n\nIt really is an emotional ride, even depressing sometimes, but I'm surprised by the occasional review I read where critics say they didn't feel the emotion to be sincere. In my opinion, the emotions of the film never hit a single false note. I don't think just anybody could have made this movie the way it is. This isn't a typical drama, the movie's genre is Payne, and he knows exactly what he's doing.\n\n***1/2 out of ****","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235017,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Judy Greer and Robert Forster are each given a few spare scenes, and they make every second of their screen time count.\n\nIt really is an emotional ride, even depressing sometimes, but I'm surprised by the occasional review I read where critics say they didn't feel the emotion to be sincere. In my opinion, the emotions of the film never hit a single false note. I don't think just anybody could have made this movie the way it is. This isn't a typical drama, the movie's genre is Payne, and he knows exactly what he's doing.\n\n***1/2 out of ****","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235017,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's the umpteenth version of two cops who love the same woman and have no other choice than to collaborate together to arrest a dangerous gangster (François Levantal) on the French Riviera. But as one of them (Pascal Elbé) discovered that his team mate (Jean Dujardin) slept with his wife, it makes him uptight and makes their mission harder to fulfill.

The film oscillates between several types of humor without managing to find its direction and it sometimes falls flat because it's too convenient. See the scene when Dujardin and Elbé are about to nab their quarry. Elbé can see a couple tenderly kissing and of course can't help but asking questions to Dujardin about his affair with his wife. Another irritating point is when Dujardin and Elbé's wife constantly plan to tell him the truth about the important piece of news mentioned in the first paragraph but can't managed to do so and have to delay it.\n\nPhilippe De Chauveron doesn't manage to find a correct proportioning between the detective investigation and what deals with the two cops' sentimental problems. And what doesn't help matters is that they're of a thin interest. And so, so is the viewer's who slowly but surely wanes.

She has a place of her own to distance herself from her parents - Haiyan ("Arrival"'s Tzi Ma) and Lu Jian (Diana Lin) - but is struggling to fund it. But despite a typically spiky teenage relationship with her parents, family is important to her.\n\nThere's a big shock then when her beloved "Nai Nai" (Shuzhen Zhao) is diagnosed back in China with terminal cancer. The slight complication is that no-one has told her. Her younger sister (Hong Lu) has taken the decision to keep the news from her. This is in line with the Chinese saying "When people get Cancer they die". (Based on the rationale that it is not necessarily the disease that kills you, but the fear that destroys your useful life).\n\nThe whole extended family sign up - reluctantly - to the decision. They stage a final get together back in China around the pretence of a trumped-up wedding. This is between the comically reluctant grandson Hao Hao (Han Chen) and his new Japanese girlfriend Aiko (Aoi Mizuhara).\n\nFaced with seeing Nai Nai face-to-face, and being forced to "celebrate" together, can the family - and the emotionally attached Billi in particular - hold it together and keep the secret?\n\nYou might naturally assume that given the subject matter that this was going to be SERIOUSLY heavy going. And in many ways you would be right. Most of us over 50 will have lost an elderly relative. And, unless it was a sudden event, you have probably been through the mental pain of having to drive away from a nursing home certain that that will be the final time you will see your loved one alive. If you are therefore not affected by this film, you are not human.\n\nHowever, the film is so beautifully put together, and the comedy - albeit some of it very dark - so brilliantly inserted that the film is an UTTER DELIGHT from start to end. There are truly insightful scenes that get under the skin of the well-developed social approach in China to family. (Like my wife they love big family dinners around a round-table!) Although there is always the teen - Bau (Jinhang Liu) in this case - with his face permanently in his phone!\n\nThere are also scenes familiar to anyone who's visited China. The gaggle of "helpful" taxi drivers outside the airport made me laugh out loud.\n\nAlso (unintentionally) funny are the multiple company logos at the start of the film. (This is reminiscent of a classic "Family Guy" scene).\n\nFor such a 'small' film, the scale is sometimes truly cinematic. Director and writer, Lulu Wang, achieves some gloriously memorable movie moments. A stony-faced, determined march of the key players towards the camera - which could be subtitled "The Magnificent Eight" - is slo-mo'd for about 30 seconds and is utterly mesmeric. And a scene at a cemetery is a comic masterpiece of Chinese tradition. Bau of course still has his face in his phone throughout!\n\nThis is only Lulu Wang's second feature, but it makes me now want to check out her first film ("Posthumous").\n\nWhat I found particularly interesting is that the film is truly multi-cultural. It's not an American film with some local content crudely inserted to cater for the Far East markets. The film is an almost equal blend of American language and Mandarin language with subtitles.\n\nLulu Wang is also not afraid to upset officials in either country. Which is better: US or China? The question keeps getting posed to Billi and discussed among the family. And - as you might expect - there are positives and negatives on each side. The film doesn't really take sides. It's a really balanced position to take.\n\nThe music is by Alex Weston, and its one of the stars of the film. It's truly quirky with everything as diverse as a vocalised version of Beethoven's Sonata No. 8 "Pathetique"; a karaoke version of "Killing Me Softly"; and a hugely entertaining Chinese version of Niilson's "Without You" over the end titles.\n\nIt's a brilliant ensemble cast (SAG awards, are you listening?), and everyone pulls their weight. Even the minor members of the cast are superb: Aoi Mizuhara in particular displays acute awkwardness brilliantly!\n\nBut leading the charge is Awkwafina. She was in the disappointing "Ocean's 8" but much more memorable in "Crazy Rich Asians" as Rachel's wacky Singapore friend. Here it's a bravado performance that is genuinely moving. She IS the slightly sulky but emotionally crushed teen.\n\n"Sub-titles? I don't do sub-titles" - Get a grip! Yes, this is a film that has sub-titles. But it uses them when required (unless you happen to be fluent in Mandarin that is!). There is also a large percentage of the film that is in English. It's all eminently watchable, even for "sub-title-phobes".\n\nThis is a feelgood film about a tough subject. The ending of the film pulls off the trick of being both devastating and uplifting at the same time.\n\nSo get yourself to the cinema and see this film! Without question, it gets my "highly recommended" tag. It's also firmly placed itself very high up in my "Films of the Year" list.\n\nAnd it's all "based on a true lie"!\n\n(For the full graphical review, please go to One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

He also did Treasure Island with a too old Christian Bale as Jim Hawkins.

The lead, playing the dual roles of the prince and the pauper, was Mark Lester, lately of "Oliver".  It was too "lately".  By the time this movie came out, Lester was FAR too old for the part(s) of street urchin and child king.  Charlton Heston (he's Henry VIII here) seems attracted to this phenomenon.  He also did Treasure Island with a too old Christian Bale as Jim Hawkins.  Anyway, Heston and the rest of the cast did fine jobs, and the picture is good fun if you can fully suspend disbelief in deep voiced Lester as an innocent child.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1762,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1978-03-17","keywords":"slapstick comedy,period drama,boy,prince,king","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Prince and the Pauper aka "Crossed Swords"","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2633105689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzc1M2Q2MzEtZDIxNS00MTZjLWFiMmEtODYwZTMxY2U5NjVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzc1M2Q2MzEtZDIxNS00MTZjLWFiMmEtODYwZTMxY2U5NjVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

But Rodney and his friends are dedicated to making sure that everyone can be safe as an old bot.\n\nRobots is a very imaginative movie with a very creative story and look. I was really impressed with this movie and would highly recommend it. It has very funny moments for both the kids and the adults, so it works for a family movie very well. Robin Williams did a terrific job as Vender, he was just a great addition and brought fun comedic relief. But the whole cast sounded like they had a lot of fun with this movie.

A great start for Sony Pictures Animation!","reviewBody":"What's a 'unihorn' you may ask? Well, it's a deer that only has one antler, of course. And you'll only see one in the new Sony Pictures Animation film, Open Season, starring Martin Lawrence, Debra Messing, Ashton Kutcher, Gary Sinise, Jon Favreau, and many more.\n\nMartin voices the lovable Boog in the film; he's the main attraction of a show at the zoo with his best friend, Beth (Debra Messing). Boog also lives with Beth, equipped with his stuffed animal, Dunkleman. On a completely side note, what would a Sony film be without a reference to one of their own. Before Boog settles in for his comfy night sleep, he checks out Pat Sajak on Wheel of Fortune.\n\nThey have a great life together doing shows for the fans, even exchanging powerful roars. But that's before Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) shows up, the hapless one-antlered deer who's been captured by the evil Shaw (Gary Sinise). Boog helps Elliot escape and makes Boog's and Beth's life miserable, forcing Beth to send the two animals away into the forest.\n\nOn his own for the first time, Boog now has to rely on himself, or be stuck with Elliot. And that means figuring out how to go to the bathroom in the wild. That's when he first runs into McSquizzy, the squirrel (voiced by Billy Connolly)  McSquizzy is the ruler of the forest trees, and has a great and powerful squirrel Army to back him up, equipped with thousand of acorns. Without a doubt, McSquizzy is one of the highlights of Open Season! He's got wit, humor, and a ton of Scottish charm.\n\nBoog realizes having Elliot around is the only way he'll get back to Beth. So they become 'partners,' much to the dismay of Boog  but the delight of Elliot, who just needs a friend. With hunting season right around the corner, the two must work together to sneak around the hunters.\n\nBut when Shaw breaks the hunting season date, the animals switch their thinking  instead of running away, they're going to fight back! And fight back they do! Trying to run away, Boog crosses a dam; unfortunately, his 900 pound body crumbles the wood.\n\nThat's when Open Season turns into Hill Street Blues! There is one of the most amazing chase scenes I've ever seen in the movies. Boog, Elliot, and their porcupine friend try and escape the gun shots of Shaw  but on water. Bobbing and weaving through the water, under water, above water, around rocks  great scene! There's even a waterfall at the end to top it off! I have somewhat of a test for animated movies I've been giving myself over the past few years  ever since seeing the water scenes in The Incredibles, and noticing how real it looked, I've started to take an eye to the screen. If water doesn't look real, than it doesn't pass the test. Let's just say, Open Season aced my test. This water chase scene goes on for about 5 minutes, maybe a little more; but it's so exciting and amazing to watch! It's not just the water of Open Season, it's the entire field of animation; the animals really come alive on the screen. I'm a huge fan of animation; I think it has to do with the fact that anything done with computer fascinates me. The detailed description of each character, from their eyes, nose, mouth, walk, and hair  and in this movie, fur; it's just so amazing! But back to the story - after meeting back up with the group of beavers, led by Reilly (voiced by Jon Favreau), some of Elliot's former deer mates (Patrick Warburton and Jane Krakowski), and a few other animals, Boog and Elliot team up and go on the attack against the hunters. Bras, plungers, grills, forks, knives, spoons, and basically, anything they can get their hands on  sorry, whatever they can get their paws on  they use to charge the hunters with.\n\nOpen Season is directed by Jill Culton, Roger Allers, and Tony Stacchi; each has a number of major credits to their name. Both Tony and Jill make their feature directorial debut on this film; however, Jill has worked at Pixar on the character development for Monsters Inc. and Toy Story. Tony worked on a number of films for ILM including Hook and Ghost. Roger Allers co-directed The Lion King, and has just recently completed The Little Match Girl  a short attached to The Little Mermaid.\n\nOpen Season is a fun and very enjoyable film for kids and families. It's definitely a film you'll be talking about for a long time. And don't forget, you can also check out the film in IMAX 3D, opening at major theaters across the country.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89010,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A great start for Sony Pictures Animation!","reviewBody":"What's a 'unihorn' you may ask? Well, it's a deer that only has one antler, of course. And you'll only see one in the new Sony Pictures Animation film, Open Season, starring Martin Lawrence, Debra Messing, Ashton Kutcher, Gary Sinise, Jon Favreau, and many more.\n\nMartin voices the lovable Boog in the film; he's the main attraction of a show at the zoo with his best friend, Beth (Debra Messing). Boog also lives with Beth, equipped with his stuffed animal, Dunkleman. On a completely side note, what would a Sony film be without a reference to one of their own. Before Boog settles in for his comfy night sleep, he checks out Pat Sajak on Wheel of Fortune.\n\nThey have a great life together doing shows for the fans, even exchanging powerful roars. But that's before Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) shows up, the hapless one-antlered deer who's been captured by the evil Shaw (Gary Sinise). Boog helps Elliot escape and makes Boog's and Beth's life miserable, forcing Beth to send the two animals away into the forest.\n\nOn his own for the first time, Boog now has to rely on himself, or be stuck with Elliot. And that means figuring out how to go to the bathroom in the wild. That's when he first runs into McSquizzy, the squirrel (voiced by Billy Connolly)  McSquizzy is the ruler of the forest trees, and has a great and powerful squirrel Army to back him up, equipped with thousand of acorns. Without a doubt, McSquizzy is one of the highlights of Open Season! He's got wit, humor, and a ton of Scottish charm.\n\nBoog realizes having Elliot around is the only way he'll get back to Beth. So they become 'partners,' much to the dismay of Boog  but the delight of Elliot, who just needs a friend. With hunting season right around the corner, the two must work together to sneak around the hunters.\n\nBut when Shaw breaks the hunting season date, the animals switch their thinking  instead of running away, they're going to fight back! And fight back they do! Trying to run away, Boog crosses a dam; unfortunately, his 900 pound body crumbles the wood.\n\nThat's when Open Season turns into Hill Street Blues! There is one of the most amazing chase scenes I've ever seen in the movies. Boog, Elliot, and their porcupine friend try and escape the gun shots of Shaw  but on water. Bobbing and weaving through the water, under water, above water, around rocks  great scene! There's even a waterfall at the end to top it off! I have somewhat of a test for animated movies I've been giving myself over the past few years  ever since seeing the water scenes in The Incredibles, and noticing how real it looked, I've started to take an eye to the screen. If water doesn't look real, than it doesn't pass the test. Let's just say, Open Season aced my test. This water chase scene goes on for about 5 minutes, maybe a little more; but it's so exciting and amazing to watch! It's not just the water of Open Season, it's the entire field of animation; the animals really come alive on the screen.

    <title lang="fr">Le papillon</title>
    <desc lang="fr">Le papillon: Directed by Philippe Muyl. With Michel Serrault, Claire Bouanich, Nade Dieu, Jacques Bouanich. This is the story of a young girl named Elsa who was raised by a single mother (Isabelle) in the city. Isabelle and Elsa begin the film moving in next door to an elderly man who collects butterflies (Julien). Isabelle who "spends a lot of time with her friends" does not pay much attention to her daughter who walks home because her mother forgot to pick her up from school. After meeting her new neighbor, Elsa finds out about the butterflies and in short annoys Julien for a while. Julien receives a mystery package from a fellow entomologist. Julien sets out on his annual attempt to find a rare species of butterfly that he had once promised his son he would find (son dead) in the French country side, specifically a region known as Vercors. Elsa stows away in his car. After being discovered she convinces him to let her come to Vercors with him. They bond while hiking and camping until Julien, who is initially annoyed by Elsa, near the end of the film seems to have a grandfather-granddaughter relationship with her. Elsa falls in a well. The police arrest Julien. Elsa tells everyone it is cool. Isabelle starts paying attention to her child. Julien and Elsa are friends.

Add to that great dialogue, good acting and a great photography and you got a movie that should be on the top 20 list of anyone looking for real movies.\n\nThe fact that the underlying storyline has already been brought several times to the big screen, with the same dexterity or not, does not detract from the fact that this film combines all its elements in a mix that positions it above the crowd. Serrault's movies might not all have been of this quality, but in recent years he has certainly managed to bring us several movies where the humane aspect of his characters prevail.\n\nDo not start looking for logical explanations for certain elements of the movie, do not psychoanalyse it and try to find faults... this movie is just like life itself, sometimes logical, sometimes illogical, often random. Just watch, enjoy and get carried away by the witty dialogue. Despite all the adversities one might encounter, it's those little things - how insignificant they may be - that make it worthwhile and helps everyone become the unique individuals we are.\n\nThis is a sincere movie suitable for the whole family that manages to stay out of the tear-jerker or kiddy movie categories. Special mention also for the soundtrack!

Add to that great dialogue, good acting and a great photography and you got a movie that should be on the top 20 list of anyone looking for real movies.\n\nThe fact that the underlying storyline has already been brought several times to the big screen, with the same dexterity or not, does not detract from the fact that this film combines all its elements in a mix that positions it above the crowd. Serrault's movies might not all have been of this quality, but in recent years he has certainly managed to bring us several movies where the humane aspect of his characters prevail.\n\nDo not start looking for logical explanations for certain elements of the movie, do not psychoanalyse it and try to find faults... this movie is just like life itself, sometimes logical, sometimes illogical, often random. Just watch, enjoy and get carried away by the witty dialogue. Despite all the adversities one might encounter, it's those little things - how insignificant they may be - that make it worthwhile and helps everyone become the unique individuals we are.\n\nThis is a sincere movie suitable for the whole family that manages to stay out of the tear-jerker or kiddy movie categories. Special mention also for the soundtrack! If you liked this you might also want to check out The Malabar Princess.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"butterfly,vercors,caterpillar,single mother,hiking","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1014479385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3MTM1YjYtNTAzOS00ZDk2LWE3MDQtMWI3NjQ2YWY1NWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3MTM1YjYtNTAzOS00ZDk2LWE3MDQtMWI3NjQ2YWY1NWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785664/","name":"Michel Serrault","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1237271/","name":"Claire Bouanich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0226383/","name":"Nade Dieu"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003974/","name":"Philippe Muyl"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012976/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022162/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003974/","name":"Philippe Muyl"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Too bad since Topher Grace is fabulous in any role and the hotness of Josh Duhamel cancels out any flaws in his acting.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":27286,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-12-08","keywords":"fictional celebrity,montage of los angeles driving shots,date,best friend,west virginia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Win a Date with Tad Hamiliton","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2156181017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQyMjk5ODQ2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAxNDMyMDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQyMjk5ODQ2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAxNDMyMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Win a Date with Tad Hamilton","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0098378/","name":"Kate Bosworth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0241049/","name":"Josh Duhamel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0333410/","name":"Topher Grace"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525659/","name":"Robert Luketic"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093794/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093253/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505741/","name":"Victor Levin"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's so ambient, it would work just as well as a radio play. En route to collecting their kids from summer camp, 'married alive' couple Antoine (Pierre-Darroussin) and Helene (Bouquet) bicker in the car, as Antoine accuses her of cramping his style. The only way this sad little man can assert himself is to pull over and slug whisky after whisky in every roadside bar. When his furious wife bails out to catch the train instead, it's the start of one of those Long Dark Nights of the Soul for both parties. 'I got sick of playing the good little doggie', Antoine tells his mysterious hitchhiker, in one of the movie's most memorable exchanges. 'You're like my doggie,' sneers his passenger. 'Always thirsty.' 'Where's your dog?' 'He's dead ' Based on the Georges Simenon novel, here's a dark little number, blackly comic, and as searing as the red neon lights that accompany each pit stop on the road to Hell.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2653,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-03-03","keywords":"alcoholic,argument between couple,color in title,watching tv,traffic","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201669/","name":"Jean-Pierre Darroussin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000962/","name":"Carole Bouquet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1563330/","name":"Vincent Deniard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0434806/","name":"Cédric Kahn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012976/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044140/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023471/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799442/","name":"Georges Simenon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274262/","name":"Laurence Ferreira Barbosa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0434806/","name":"Cédric Kahn"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Emmanuelle Devos won the César for her performance as Carla the deaf office worker, and she dominates the movie along with the sexy, sleazy Paul (Vincent Cassel), a recently paroled petty thief.  The movie is about their odd relationship -- mutual exploitation, let's call it -- and about the successful caper that results as well as Carla's newfound power at the busy property development company where she hires Paul, despite his complete lack of office skills, as her assistant.  It's obvious she's lonely and looks on this as a chance to get a man, but it's also a chance to have somebody to kick around the way she's been kicked around at the office, and, when she sees the value of it, a chance to use his muscle and menace to bolster her job.\n\n What neither of them anticipates is the way their mutual dependency and very different skills lead them into intimacy and crime -- not necessarily in that order.   Audiard, who co-scripted the film with Tonino Benacquista, and who's known for the richly entertaining `A Self-Made Hero' (`Un Héros Très Discret," 1996), adopts here a very selective, liquid, often claustrophobic way of filming and editing.  He uses a lot of tight close-ups, dark lighting, and fast cuts between scenes that are as rapid and unceremonious as Benoît Jacquot's in the 1998 `School of Flesh' (`L'École de la Chair'). We know we have to stay on our toes.  We're expected to pay close attention and do some thinking.\n\nWe also often feel we're spying on people from Carla's point of view, as she does when she reads the lips of gossiping coworkers for herself (and later for Paul) at the office canteen, or when at Paul's prompting she uses binoculars to read lips in a gangland nightclub owner's apartment that Paul starts casing out after he's forced because of a debt to moonlight at the club. In her apartment we see her put on Paul's bloody shirt naked after he's been beaten, or try on sexy new shoes the same way, and again the camera angle is dark and close up so we only glimpse parts of her in the dirty mirror. (There's a parallelism between iris-ed images in the movie and Carla's limited hearing.) This is an intrusive, expressionistic camera, but the editing makes us maintain an alert distance as the plot moves from Carla's initially limited existence to its transformation by the explosive personality of Paul and the more and more dangerous embroilments that happen when the two become a mutually exploitive team.\n\nWe keep seeing the characters enter into yet one more new scene that we sense is risky without quite knowing why.  Somehow we're detached and scared at the same time.  Paul and Carla each create a world of uncertainty and peril for each other.  There's a growing unease that turns into increasing excitement and danger, and finally there's Hitchcockian suspense effectively augmented by forceful cross-cutting between Carla watching the gangsters through the apartment windows after a heist and Paul manning the noisy nightclub bar, which now also has become a threatening place.\n\nThe movie has flaws.  An airline ticket seems to have wings.  Carla is too magically able to carry out Paul's instructions, gathered only from a few hastily mouthed words lip-read between two buildings.  A subplot concerning Paul's parole officer (Olivier Perrier) is superfluous and confusing. Given that so much effective use is made of varying sound levels to convey Carla's hearing with and without her two hearing aids -- turned up, turned down, or removed -- the musical background score in non-nightclub scenes is obtrusive.\n\nBut what's strong about this movie is that it has two actors with the power to dominate the screen, and a director who works with a lot of authority and freshness in presenting his vision.\n\nEmmanuelle Devos' characterization as the mousy but smart and persistent Carla is so rich and assured we may just take it for granted -- but the French film industry didn't, since they not only gave her the César, but did so in a year when the other contenders were Charlotte Rampling in `Sur la Sable,' Audrey Tautou in `Amélie,' and Isabelle Huppert in `La Pianiste." Vincent Cassel, who's said he's an instinctive actor, simply embodies his part:  it's his prison tattoo, his sleazy mustache, his oily hair, and his tall, wiry, threatening physicality that make him both repulsive and sexy as Paul.  We experience here the powerful onscreen presence that's turned him into one of the hottest young film actors in France since he starred in Mattieu Kassovitz's `La Haine' in 1995.  (He was seen in the US last year in the enjoyable costume flick, `Le Pacte des Loups,' and is in a lot of new movies to come.)\n\nPeople are saying this is sure to lead to an American remake with big stars. Maybe so, but it's Audiard's vision that makes the picture interesting. All the Hollywood stars in the world won't take the place of Audiard's handheld camera and mercurial editing style, or a unique talent that combines sensitivity to the indignities of office workers and parolees with the ability to reinvent film noir tradition.\n\nAlso unique -- and unlikely to survive an American remake -- is the repression of sexuality between Paul and Carla, which makes the sexual tension between them seem all the more powerful throughout this tightly constructed, economical movie."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15075,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-17","keywords":"fetish,deaf woman,gangster,single woman,disappearance of sister","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0222922/","name":"Emmanuelle Devos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332709/","name":"Olivier Gourmet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010766/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070152/","name":"Tonino Benacquista"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Vincent Cassel, who's said he's an instinctive actor, simply embodies his part:  it's his prison tattoo, his sleazy mustache, his oily hair, and his tall, wiry, threatening physicality that make him both repulsive and sexy as Paul.  We experience here the powerful onscreen presence that's turned him into one of the hottest young film actors in France since he starred in Mattieu Kassovitz's `La Haine' in 1995.  (He was seen in the US last year in the enjoyable costume flick, `Le Pacte des Loups,' and is in a lot of new movies to come.)\n\nPeople are saying this is sure to lead to an American remake with big stars. Maybe so, but it's Audiard's vision that makes the picture interesting. All the Hollywood stars in the world won't take the place of Audiard's handheld camera and mercurial editing style, or a unique talent that combines sensitivity to the indignities of office workers and parolees with the ability to reinvent film noir tradition.\n\nAlso unique -- and unlikely to survive an American remake -- is the repression of sexuality between Paul and Carla, which makes the sexual tension between them seem all the more powerful throughout this tightly constructed, economical movie.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15075,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-17","keywords":"fetish,deaf woman,gangster,single woman,disappearance of sister","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0222922/","name":"Emmanuelle Devos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332709/","name":"Olivier Gourmet"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010766/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070152/","name":"Tonino Benacquista"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The plot is rather simple: a French special forces unit (the movie is French/French-produced) is sent in to rescue a journalist from Afghanistan who has been captured by a Taliban warlord. Right off the bat, you are introduced to the principal characters, but not much is given in the way of character development or making the audience care, aside from some small character moments interspersed throughout the latter half of the film. The performances are adequate, with the best being given by Diane Kruger (as the journalist) and Djimon Hounsou (one of the special forces guys). The actor who portrays the Taliban warlord also does a good job, probably adding some depth to his character by having him be Western-educated and somewhat caught between Western culture and his own culture and beliefs, but not much attention is paid to his character either. It also doesn't help that his demise later in the film is done so haphazardly and unceremoniously. As far as the combat sequences go, they were fine and done in current "en vogue" style of somewhat shaky "cinema verite" realism to give a sense of the chaos of battle. The violence was effective and not gratuitous in any way. However, towards the end the movie drags a little bit as we're shown day after day passing of the core group trying to get away from their pursuers and safely back into Afghanistan (they've been wandering around in the Pakistani desert for most of the movie). Overall, the movie is effective in the combat sequences and showing how the special forces team bond with the people they try to rescue. Over the course of the film, you do grow to care a little bit more about the characters but not because you feel like you really know them, just because you empathize with the sticky situation they're in. The movie aspires to be SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (made by the French, and set during the Afghan war), but it falls short of the mark. Still, it makes for a somewhat entertaining, slightly taxing, viewing experience.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18373,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2011-11-02","keywords":"mountain pass,stitching a wound,scene after end credits,chase,two word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2752297753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM2OTFkMTMtZWYxNC00Y2NkLTgzYmUtOTI3MDJkOTNiOGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM2OTFkMTMtZWYxNC00Y2NkLTgzYmUtOTI3MDJkOTNiOGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1208167/","name":"Diane Kruger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005023/","name":"Djimon Hounsou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536095/","name":"Benoît Magimel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1360702/","name":"Stéphane Rybojad"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0304607/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1360702/","name":"Stéphane Rybojad"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0178264/","name":"Michael Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4389075/","name":"Emmanuelle Collomp"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The plot is rather simple: a French special forces unit (the movie is French/French-produced) is sent in to rescue a journalist from Afghanistan who has been captured by a Taliban warlord. Right off the bat, you are introduced to the principal characters, but not much is given in the way of character development or making the audience care, aside from some small character moments interspersed throughout the latter half of the film. The performances are adequate, with the best being given by Diane Kruger (as the journalist) and Djimon Hounsou (one of the special forces guys). The actor who portrays the Taliban warlord also does a good job, probably adding some depth to his character by having him be Western-educated and somewhat caught between Western culture and his own culture and beliefs, but not much attention is paid to his character either. It also doesn't help that his demise later in the film is done so haphazardly and unceremoniously. As far as the combat sequences go, they were fine and done in current "en vogue" style of somewhat shaky "cinema verite" realism to give a sense of the chaos of battle. The violence was effective and not gratuitous in any way.

Admittedly, due to word of mouth from those who had attended earlier screenings of the film, my expectations for Clash of the Titans were fairly low. On top of that, many of the initial casting choices appeared to be somewhat suspect. So, what's my verdict? Well, I didn't hate it  \n\nThe plot of Titans is extremely straightforward – practically to a fault. Often, the film acts as though it's in a hurry, attempting to get from one action sequence to the next as quickly as possible. The scenes that occur in between each of these battles ultimately amount to nothing more than brief segments of exposition delivered by Perseus' "guardian angel" of sorts, Io (Gemma Arterton). So, while the film never really drags, it feels very soulless.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject of these action sequences, none of them end up being particularly memorable. About half of them are so frenetic to the point where they're almost disorienting - honestly, I'm glad that the 3D screenings were sold out this time 'round. On top of that, there's virtually no character development outside of Worthington's character (and even he isn't all that likable), so I never really cared about the outcome of these action sequences either. Also, as I mentioned earlier, my biggest fear with Titans was in regards to the acting, and thankfully, most of the cast do what's expected of them. Neeson's Zeus aside, none of the performances truly stand out, but they're nothing cringe-worthy either.\n\nUltimately, Clash of the Titans ends up being a forgettable piece of entertainment with a couple of gaping plot holes, hit-or-miss action sequences, and performances that fail to leave much of an impression. It's not horrible – just hollow.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":273295,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Admittedly, due to word of mouth from those who had attended earlier screenings of the film, my expectations for Clash of the Titans were fairly low. On top of that, many of the initial casting choices appeared to be somewhat suspect. So, what's my verdict? Well, I didn't hate it  \n\nThe plot of Titans is extremely straightforward – practically to a fault. Often, the film acts as though it's in a hurry, attempting to get from one action sequence to the next as quickly as possible. The scenes that occur in between each of these battles ultimately amount to nothing more than brief segments of exposition delivered by Perseus' "guardian angel" of sorts, Io (Gemma Arterton). So, while the film never really drags, it feels very soulless.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject of these action sequences, none of them end up being particularly memorable. About half of them are so frenetic to the point where they're almost disorienting - honestly, I'm glad that the 3D screenings were sold out this time 'round. On top of that, there's virtually no character development outside of Worthington's character (and even he isn't all that likable), so I never really cared about the outcome of these action sequences either. Also, as I mentioned earlier, my biggest fear with Titans was in regards to the acting, and thankfully, most of the cast do what's expected of them. Neeson's Zeus aside, none of the performances truly stand out, but they're nothing cringe-worthy either.\n\nUltimately, Clash of the Titans ends up being a forgettable piece of entertainment with a couple of gaping plot holes, hit-or-miss action sequences, and performances that fail to leave much of an impression. It's not horrible – just hollow.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":273295,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Add to the mix the danger of bringing a much-loved novel to life on screen, and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—based on John le Carré's book—throws an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up, making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key characters—most of whom go by at least two names—the film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed, particularly considering its reserved pace; the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression, constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film, the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache; indeed, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed therein—the brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shot—an extreme close-up of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow— affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids, giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of, and familiarity with, this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast; a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display: a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt, Hardy to Cumberbatch, Oldman to Dencik, the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together, each actor inhabiting their character with award-courting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisation—an all-too often underutilised aspect in this genre—each of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage, but ours is with them: exploring their motivations; their private lives; their loyalties; and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities, but rather human beings with emotions, afflicted by the agonies of their toils, burying themselves in vodka-laced punch to just get away from it all.\n\nHitting all the right notes in its performances, script, and direction, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity, questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives.

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was co-written and directed by Stéphane Brizé. \n\nIn a short introduction before the film began, the presenter pointed out the the actual translation of the French title would be "The Law of the Market." Both titles tell us something about the plot of the movie. "The Measure of a Man" emphasizes the basic humanity of the protagonist. "The Law of the Market" emphasizes the basic inhumanity of the marketplace-driven society in which he lives.\n\nVincent Lindon plays Thierry Taugourdeau, who has lost his skilled labor job because of a factory closure. (Other displaced workers want to sue the company for pulling out of France to go elsewhere. Apparently, this isn't legal if the company is making a profit in France. However, Thierry isn't interested.)\n\nThierry is accustomed to getting a good salary in a respected job. As the film opens, we learn that he has taken a three-month course in order to learn how to be a crane operator. He informs the government employment counselor that the course was worthless. Companies will only employ crane operators that are already experienced construction workers. Why did they advise him to take a course that couldn't lead to employment?\n\nThe film continues in the same vein. Thierry truly wants to work to support himself, his wife, and his son with cerebral palsy. (The son is portrayed by Matthieu Schaller, who does indeed have cerebral palsy.)\n\nWe follow Thierry from frustration to frustration as nothing he does brings him employment. Finally, he obtains employment, and that is where the measure of a man begins.\n\nThis is a fascinating--but painful--movie to watch. We're accustomed to unhappy stories in which the protagonists are down-and-out, and the situation is hopeless. This plot doesn't fit into that mold. Thierry has had a comfortable, middle-class life. He's intelligent and resourceful. Even so, he can't counter the forces of society that tell him that he and his family have to move down a notch--or more--in order to survive.\n\nVincent Lindon is brilliant in this role. We can identify with him and it is not a comfortable feeling. Lindon won the Best Actor award at Cannes for this portrayal, and I'm not surprised. It's worth seeing this film just for an opportunity to watch a superb actor succeeding in a difficult role.\n\nWe saw this film in the excellent Dryden Theatre in Rochester's George Eastman Museum. It was shown a part of the outstanding Rochester Labor Film Series. \n\nFor reasons I don't understand, this movie has a dismal IMDb rating of 6.8. Possibly, reviewers found it simply too depressing. Yes, it's depressing, but it reflects reality, and I think it's definitely worth seeking out. It's available on DVD and Blu-Ray. It's too important a film to miss.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5928,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-05-19","keywords":"supermarket,working class,france,trailer camp,campground","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"La loi du marché (The Measure of a Man)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2223026201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MDMzMTc2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA3MTQ2NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MDMzMTc2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA3MTQ2NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Full trailer for La loi du marché (The Measure of a Man) in French."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0512071/","name":"Vincent Lindon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7379140/","name":"Karine de Mirbeck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7379141/","name":"Matthieu Schaller"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0110300/","name":"Stéphane Brizé"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085679/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0110300/","name":"Stéphane Brizé"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0329825/","name":"Olivier Gorce"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, films about politicians and those around them seem to be more successful than the politicians themselves. A good example in this regard is 'Alice et le maire' ('Alice and the Mayor') a film that comes from France, a country that seems to be in recent years in a permanent state of dissatisfaction with the existing economic and social order, with its political institutions and with members of the political class. The film, whose action takes place a few years ago at the City Hall of Lyon and in the milieu of the municipal and political bureaucracy of the Socialist Party, enjoyed an unexpected success without even resorting to sensationalist issues such as crime, sex, or corruption scandals. Perhaps precisely through the relaxed and slightly humorous approach, the script written by Nicolas Pariser (who is also the director of the film) reaches more effectively aspects of deeper, systemic corruption of the French political machinery.\n\nHowever, the premises of the story do not seem too credible. I am not very familiar with the French political system, but I believe that even in France there are no positions for philosophers advisers to the mayors, paid on public money, nor that politicians with decades of political activity and presidential ambitions publicly declare that they are short of ideas. Probably, then, only in the films Alice (Anaïs Demoustier), a fresh graduate from Oxford, could she employed at the City Hall in Lyon just to provide ideas to Mayor Paul Theraneau (Fabrice Luchini) and that could become in a few days or weeks involved at top level in the affairs of the city and of the Socialist Party. The activity of the party on the public money of the town hall also seems little plausible. Probably the whole situation should be viewed more as a cinematic convention rather than real events in the immediate actuality. But even so, the dialogues between the mayor and the young philosopher represent the guiding thread and the most successful and probably the most important part of the movie from the point of view of the filmmakers.\n\nThe discussions between the two protagonists work very well thanks to the charm and the talent of the two actors. The mayor's role is written for Fabrice Luchini who lends to the character his noble style, intellectual charisma and impeccable French language, serving us even with a reading from a book, one of those that made him famous in France. Anaïs Demoustier copes well with the scenes that she shares with Luchini, but also with those that describe her personal dilemmas and the confrontation with the municipal bureaucracy. Secondary roles create believable portrait sketches of Alice's friends and of the politicians and bureaucrats in the town hall hierarchy. The story, however, stumbles badly towards the end, when the politician's decision or indecision at critical moments is difficult to understand, perhaps due to the use of details related to party politics. French viewers might be better off deciphering such details as well as some of the literary and cultural references appearing in discussions, but cinematically the story does not hold water. The approach of 'Alice and the Mayor' is comical and empathetic towards the heroes, the ending is open, so what we get is pleasant entertainment around a political topic. Of course, there will be other films that will address the troubled French political actuality with different approaches and from many other points of view.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"lyon france,mayor,politics,female protagonist,year 2017","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2747252249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1326732/","name":"Anaïs Demoustier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3937233/","name":"Nora Hamzawi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093091/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625796/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even though they do not call that "war"?\n\nPerhaps they should do like the young girl who thinks she is in a play ,in a reality-show ,where you can win points ?\n\n"Problemos" is uneven ,sometimes confused ,but the pessimistic side , in what is primarily a comedy, will not be lost on the viewer.\n\nLike this ?try these......\n\n"L'An 01 " Jacques Doillon ,1973\n\n"Le Dernier Homme " Charles Bitsch ;1969\n\n"Le Dernier Combat" Luc Besson ,1982."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1349,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-05-10","keywords":"seduction,cell phone,bikini,murder,fire","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3429744153","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM0NjYwNzktZTVhYi00MmJlLWFiM2UtNTMxY2NmNzM4OWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM0NjYwNzktZTVhYi00MmJlLWFiM2UtNTMxY2NmNzM4OWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431956/","name":"Eric Judor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3226240/","name":"Blanche Gardin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1763487/","name":"Youssef Hajdi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431956/","name":"Eric Judor"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315631/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4380548/","name":"Noé Debré"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3226240/","name":"Blanche Gardin"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even though they do not call that "war"?\n\nPerhaps they should do like the young girl who thinks she is in a play ,in a reality-show ,where you can win points ?\n\n"Problemos" is uneven ,sometimes confused ,but the pessimistic side , in what is primarily a comedy, will not be lost on the viewer.\n\nLike this ?try these......\n\n"L'An 01 " Jacques Doillon ,1973\n\n"Le Dernier Homme " Charles Bitsch ;1969\n\n"Le Dernier Combat" Luc Besson ,1982.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1349,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-05-10","keywords":"seduction,cell phone,bikini,murder,fire","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3429744153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM0NjYwNzktZTVhYi00MmJlLWFiM2UtNTMxY2NmNzM4OWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM0NjYwNzktZTVhYi00MmJlLWFiM2UtNTMxY2NmNzM4OWZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431956/","name":"Eric Judor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3226240/","name":"Blanche Gardin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1763487/","name":"Youssef Hajdi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0431956/","name":"Eric Judor"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315631/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4380548/","name":"Noé Debré","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3226240/","name":"Blanche Gardin"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There are a few changes in the facts, probably to make this move more dramatic, but perhaps the book from which this film derives, was written like that. The tough days in Marie Curie's life when she arrived in Paris is hardly touched, which undoubtedly lead to her stubborn attitude which is over characterized in this film. In real life she was not such a hard and difficult person.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13549,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is a period film centered around a Family in the 1950s. The film depict a crucial time in Life of a boy (the eldest son), who witnesses the loss of innocence and the lack of control over his deepest feelings triggered it seems by the arrival of his new born brother.\n\nBut Tree of Life is also a variation over the meaning of Life and Death alternating between a cosmic vision of Life and a subjective and often poetic vision of childhood as an aphorism for Grace, Nature and Love.\n\nThe films then introduces the unbearable Death, the one that can't be explain the one that shakes the very balance of a Family, the Death of a son of a brother as we learn that the second born died suddenly at the age of 19 (probably at War).\n\nHowever the genuine narration and enigmatic if not poetic vision of the cosmos mixed with state of the heart but virtual shots depicting how Life started (the way of Nature) makes for a slide-show of boredom. And as we move along the story of this family seems more and more like a "collage" exercise, some kind of a pretext to voice over cosmic images philosophical questions from our main tree protagonists (The Mother, the elder son and the Father). The result is messy and at times superficial.\n\nIn this blend of images and emotions actors aren't use to deliver an acting performance but more so to make the philosophical questioning move along. The problem is the questioning stagnates and closure never really gets through. Even if we understand that the border between Life and Death is as thin as a bank of sand between two seas on which we may meet sometimes, the audience is left with the same Belief before entering the Theater. Eventually you remain the same before and after the movie. You don't feel any more comfort, tranquility, clarity or even sadness. You've just seen beautiful shots.\n\nSoaked with Christian Philosophy Tree of Life delivers as a very well shot film but never provides the audience with a sense of progression and closure. The story of this Family never really takes off nor does the Philosophic Questioning gets to an end.\n\nAt posteriori Tree of Life seems like an audacious idea on paper and lays out good material to explore. However the film ends up resembling a nice slide-show with little to no story, which makes me wander if cinema was the best medium for this cosmic Tale.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":170473,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But in fact Israelis and Palestinians unfortunately do not watch each other's TV stations. Cable doesn't carry them and each other's satellites are 3 degrees apart but that's enough not to allow mutual reception. So the central idea of the film is fantasy, but it's very enjoyable.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1933,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-04-03","keywords":"palestinian identity,occupation,imperialism,tzahal,heroine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tel Aviv On Fire !?!?!

Christine is quite believable as manager of the Paris branch of a multinational (fake name, Barney Johnson, but mainly shown on their office paper) in product strategies for food, perfectly cast here as business woman. The main offices are in America (New York and Washington, so there are some English dialogs with executives from these offices, very short) and we see Isabelle going to Cairo (although surely not filmed there). She is not so believable as being the 2nd in command. I was not so aware of her having such high position until a Japanese delegation wants a picture with the 2 top managers of this firm (her and Christine). The work environment is quite unbelievable,just designer office rooms with a desk on which you almost don't see them doing anything and in the meetings they are in, nothing is discussed, only showing the ends of these meetings. But this movie is about the power struggle between these 2 and who they use and abuse for their purpose of getting to the top (Christine is aiming at a job in the head office in New York). This is the best part of the movie. Isabelle is extremely fanatical about her work, which means everything to her, she has no friends (as Sagnier said in a Dutch interview). This hard-working Isabelle does the best work but Christine claims it as having been hers on 3 occasions. Isabelle both admires (loves) and hates Christine. Christine says at one point that she loves Isabelle. Both have a love-affair with the same colleague, who at a certain moment is being blackmailed by Christine, much to the disgust of Isabelle. It all turns wrong when Christine shows security camera pictures of Isabelle having gotten angry and having a car accident in the garage and humiliates her in front of all their colleagues at a party, where she already felt uncomfortable, not talking with anyone. Christine meant it as a joke, she said, but her degrading remarks to Isabelle show otherwise. The rest of the movie is all about Isabelle's quite-clever-or-not revenge, which I won't reveal here (one can find more than enough about that already). It's all not terribly surprising or great cinema, but it is an entertaining thriller which grips you from beginning to end, despite some incredibleness. I think money is well spent on going to this movie, especially if you're a fan of Kristin Scott Thomas, who speaks excellent French and is great here, as usual. 104 minutes, some flashbacks in black and white. If you liked "La Tourneuse de Pages", this comes close, at least in the beginning. I have seen it twice now (2 pre-premieres) and must say the beginning remains fascinating, whereas the second part becomes weaker the more you see it, but it still is an ingenious detective plot, a tribute to this much too young deceased (67) film-maker.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5269,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-08-18","keywords":"taupe pantyhose,female stockinged legs,pantyhose,suntan pantyhose,female boss","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Love Crime","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1858509849","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMTQwNDE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg2ODEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMTQwNDE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg2ODEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When Christine, a powerful executive, brings on a naive young ingÃ©nue as her assistant, she delights in toying with her naivete and teaching her hard lessons in a ruthless professional philosophy.

By showing a little more transparency, they could have made an excellent movie from a simply good movie. 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6348,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2019-05-10","keywords":"climate change,sustainable farming,farm,pig,dog","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1108326937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBkYmY3OTYtYWU1ZC00N2YxLWFjMGYtYTNkZjY2YWE5ZTdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBkYmY3OTYtYWU1ZC00N2YxLWFjMGYtYTNkZjY2YWE5ZTdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Documentarian John Chester and his wife Molly work to develop a sustainable farm on 200 acres outside of Los Angeles.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092965/","name":"John Chester","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10107265/","name":"Molly Chester","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12612142/","name":"Beauden Chester"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092965/","name":"John Chester"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0250936/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0713087/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092965/","name":"John Chester","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0598531/","name":"Mark Monroe"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The conversation Paul has with Jon's forlorn girl-friend about his theory of sadness is also very moving, as is Paul's reading of the children's storybook to his younger brother, if both are somewhat obscure.The father preparing dinner whilst his estranged wife outlines the difficulties of their previous relationship seems rooted in reality. Paul's self-destructive behaviour and the see-saw moods of his relationship are bizarre believable. The relationships are discussed in a way that is both reflective and expressive, such a change from the cutesy-clichés of American romances.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-10-04","keywords":"male frontal nudity,barefoot male,bare chested male,bare breasts,male full rear nudity","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244151/","name":"Romain Duris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308039/","name":"Louis Garrel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2372335/","name":"Alice Butaud"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393394/","name":"Christophe Honoré"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067852/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093907/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393394/","name":"Christophe Honoré"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 0769508, Title: Dans Paris, 
 --- Description: Dans Paris: Directed by Christophe Honoré. With Romain Duris, Louis Garrel, Guy Marchand, Joana Preiss. After a love affair ends badly, a young Parisian named Paul (Romain Duris) sinks into the same kind of deep depression that led his sister to kill herself. He moves back home with his father (Guy Marchand) and aimless brother Jonathan (Louis Garrel) but refuses to get out of bed.

The conversation Paul has with Jon's forlorn girl-friend about his theory of sadness is also very moving, as is Paul's reading of the children's storybook to his younger brother, if both are somewhat obscure.The father preparing dinner whilst his estranged wife outlines the difficulties of their previous relationship seems rooted in reality. Paul's self-destructive behaviour and the see-saw moods of his relationship are bizarre believable. The relationships are discussed in a way that is both reflective and expressive, such a change from the cutesy-clichés of American romances.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-10-04","keywords":"male frontal nudity,barefoot male,bare chested male,bare breasts,male full rear nudity","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244151/","name":"Romain Duris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308039/","name":"Louis Garrel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2372335/","name":"Alice Butaud"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393394/","name":"Christophe Honoré"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067852/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093907/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393394/","name":"Christophe Honoré"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A working guy (Andrew Garfield), who is evicted from his home, attempts to make his way up the capitalist dungheap by making himself useful to the guy (Michael Shannon) whose company oversaw the eviction.\n\nAndrew Garfield is not obvious casting for this blue-collar role, but he is a sympathetic presence. He wears his vulnerability so openly, like a contemporary Anthony Perkins, that you can't help but feel for his character as he digs himself deeper and deeper into the mire. Michael Shannon, superb, is only too believable as a man who strives to have no conscience.\n\nThere is no doubt that Bahrani is a fine filmmaker, and I'm sure there'll be more high-standard stuff to come from him.

A working guy (Andrew Garfield), who is evicted from his home, attempts to make his way up the capitalist dungheap by making himself useful to the guy (Michael Shannon) whose company oversaw the eviction.\n\nAndrew Garfield is not obvious casting for this blue-collar role, but he is a sympathetic presence. He wears his vulnerability so openly, like a contemporary Anthony Perkins, that you can't help but feel for his character as he digs himself deeper and deeper into the mire. Michael Shannon, superb, is only too believable as a man who strives to have no conscience.\n\nThere is no doubt that Bahrani is a fine filmmaker, and I'm sure there'll be more high-standard stuff to come from him. His observation of male behaviour when under pressure is acute and compassionate. His weak spot, on the basis of the two movies of his that I've seen, is that his female characters are so insubstantial.

It's definitely one of the most depressing films I've ever seen.\n\nManchester by the Sea tells the story of a depressed man named Lee who has to take care of his brother's son after his unfortunate death.\n\nThis is not a film that you go to watch for a good time. Manchester by the Sea made me feel really sad throughout the entirety of it and it's mainly done through the amazing performances and level of authenticity writer-director Kenneth Lonergan creates. This film is very simple. It's not stylish in any way and Lonergan's script maintains the realism through the runtime. At no point did I think there were actors playing the characters because the performances and conversations they were all having seemed too real. This made Lonergan's story about guilt, pain and depression more impactful and heartbreaking.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a career best performance by Casey Affleck. It's a performance that's rather sombre instead of flashy. His facial expressions are very subtle but you can still tell how broken and unhappy of a man he is. When you first see his character, you tend to dislike him but after finding out the reason why he's so miserable, you root for him and want him to recover from his depressive state. Michelle Williams isn't in the film much but she's brilliant in all the scenes she's present in. I thought Lucas Hedges was good but there were times where I found his accent quite jarring and a scene where he cries didn't seem too realistic.\n\nIt's best going into Manchester by the Sea not knowing much as I feel it makes the film more poignant. It's may not be an easy watch but I would like people to experience it so they can see the Kenneth Lonergan's talent as well as Casey Affleck's masterful performance.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":259929,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-12-16","keywords":"death,death of brother,manchester massachusetts,guardian,attempted suicide","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi967947801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg1MDQ3Mjc0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgzOTE4OTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg1MDQ3Mjc0Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzgzOTE4OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An uncle is forced to take care of his teenage nephew after the boy's father dies."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000729/","name":"Casey Affleck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0931329/","name":"Michelle Williams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0151419/","name":"Kyle Chandler"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0518836/","name":"Kenneth Lonergan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319272/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0506728/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0358992/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0518836/","name":"Kenneth Lonergan"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There, Solomon witnesses numerous acts of cruelty that no man should ever face.\n\nAs I stared at the movie screen with full dread, I was reeling back at certain scenes I had just witnessed. There were good films and television shows about slavery before, and they had various nuances at how to tackle slavery. This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of "Django Unchained" and "The Butler". But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen's "12 Years a Slave" shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.\n\nSteve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.\n\nCentral to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.\n\nA fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender's portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.\n\nI was left speechless as the credits rolled. A lesser film would have added tacked-on sentimentality/exaggeration and politically influenced claptrap. Not this one. This is a movie to watch as a reminder of how powerful the human spirit can endeavor, and how lucky all of us have grown past that dreadful time in history. The full effect of it has not been felt in movies before, until now.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":655561,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is a slapstick-heavy family movie that should delight young children and keep parents entertained.\n\nThe Croods are the last remaining family in an arid desert landscape. They have survived by following family patriarch Grug's (Nicolas Cage) rules to the letter, including staying in the cave after dark and fearing anything that seems new (new is BAAAD). Despite this, teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) wants to break free and rebels against her father, which results in a chance meeting with the highly inventive Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who warns her that the end of the world is nigh. When the Croods' cave is destroyed, the family is forced on a journey into a strange new world where Grug's rules clash with Guy's techniques for survival.\n\nThe Croods is a formulaic movie that sticks to a traditional hero's journey and relies on typical archetypes, but it's elevated by the writing and direction of Kirk DeMicco and How to Train Your Dragon's Chris Sanders. Like Sanders' previous work, The Croods focuses on a family's dynamic and relationships. This time, the focus is on a protective father who wants to protect his family physically and protect his daughter from a member of the opposite sex who suddenly challenges his position as the alpha male. While the trailers and first half of the movie made is seem Eep was the main character, it's actually Grug who goes through the greatest change and learns the biggest lessons.\n\nThe story is one about learning, exploring, and using one's intelligence. It also touches on the idea that it's unhealthy to live a sheltered life. But at times, the movie lays it on a bit too much with Guy and his "solutions" leaving Grug on the losing end.\n\nMost of the humour used in The Croods is very physical and slapstick oriented. Characters have Loony Toons levels of invincibility as they endure intense physical pain. This type of humour obviously appeals to fairly young children, but I would be lying if I said I did not laugh at the film at all. The Croods avoids using crude toilet humour to generate cheap laughs. There is not much in the way of verbal humour, but there are some running gags, and modernisms are kept to a minimum. They are still there but they are more putting modern products in a Stone Age setting, a little like The Flintstones, so they serve more as pop-cultural winks to adults.\n\nAs expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. It's quick and fluid, and the camera flows nicely as it follows the action. The Croods themselves have a seemingly unpleasant, bulky design to them but it actually works in the context of the film because the characters live in the wild, so big and broad makes sense. It is a little refreshing to see the main female character is not made out to be a stunning beauty, but rather someone who has been shaped by her environment. The beginning of the movie starts with in dry, mono-coloured landscapes before we get to see the bright colours of the jungle and continually seeing the weird creature reminiscence of designs of Sanders' previous works.\n\nLike other animated movies these days, The Croods has a big name voice cast and they also do a decent, if standard job. No one disgraces themselves. Cage is an unusual choice, but he gives a strong performance. There is only one time when Cage is let off the handle; Unfortunately, that is when we are experiencing the most modernism the movie has to offer.\n\nThe Croods is not going to match the heights of DreamsWorks major hits of Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon. But it certainly does not belong with the dregs the studio has to offer. It does what it sets out to do: make a movie that will please children while attempting to give a positive message and some heart. It has an old-fashioned sense of humour that leads to a surprisingly enjoyable animated movie.\n\nPlease visit www.entertainmentfuse.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201412,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"caveman,journey,cave,survival,strict father","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi126265113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The world's very first prehistoric family goes on a road trip to an uncharted and fantastical world."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000092/","name":"John Cleese"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Despite this, teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) wants to break free and rebels against her father, which results in a chance meeting with the highly inventive Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who warns her that the end of the world is nigh. When the Croods' cave is destroyed, the family is forced on a journey into a strange new world where Grug's rules clash with Guy's techniques for survival.\n\nThe Croods is a formulaic movie that sticks to a traditional hero's journey and relies on typical archetypes, but it's elevated by the writing and direction of Kirk DeMicco and How to Train Your Dragon's Chris Sanders. Like Sanders' previous work, The Croods focuses on a family's dynamic and relationships. This time, the focus is on a protective father who wants to protect his family physically and protect his daughter from a member of the opposite sex who suddenly challenges his position as the alpha male. While the trailers and first half of the movie made is seem Eep was the main character, it's actually Grug who goes through the greatest change and learns the biggest lessons.\n\nThe story is one about learning, exploring, and using one's intelligence. It also touches on the idea that it's unhealthy to live a sheltered life. But at times, the movie lays it on a bit too much with Guy and his "solutions" leaving Grug on the losing end.\n\nMost of the humour used in The Croods is very physical and slapstick oriented. Characters have Loony Toons levels of invincibility as they endure intense physical pain. This type of humour obviously appeals to fairly young children, but I would be lying if I said I did not laugh at the film at all. The Croods avoids using crude toilet humour to generate cheap laughs. There is not much in the way of verbal humour, but there are some running gags, and modernisms are kept to a minimum. They are still there but they are more putting modern products in a Stone Age setting, a little like The Flintstones, so they serve more as pop-cultural winks to adults.\n\nAs expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. It's quick and fluid, and the camera flows nicely as it follows the action. The Croods themselves have a seemingly unpleasant, bulky design to them but it actually works in the context of the film because the characters live in the wild, so big and broad makes sense. It is a little refreshing to see the main female character is not made out to be a stunning beauty, but rather someone who has been shaped by her environment. The beginning of the movie starts with in dry, mono-coloured landscapes before we get to see the bright colours of the jungle and continually seeing the weird creature reminiscence of designs of Sanders' previous works.\n\nLike other animated movies these days, The Croods has a big name voice cast and they also do a decent, if standard job. No one disgraces themselves. Cage is an unusual choice, but he gives a strong performance. There is only one time when Cage is let off the handle; Unfortunately, that is when we are experiencing the most modernism the movie has to offer.\n\nThe Croods is not going to match the heights of DreamsWorks major hits of Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon. But it certainly does not belong with the dregs the studio has to offer. It does what it sets out to do: make a movie that will please children while attempting to give a positive message and some heart. It has an old-fashioned sense of humour that leads to a surprisingly enjoyable animated movie.\n\nPlease visit www.entertainmentfuse.com","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201412,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"caveman,journey,cave,survival,strict father","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi126265113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The world's very first prehistoric family goes on a road trip to an uncharted and fantastical world.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000092/","name":"John Cleese"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Didn't want to watch, cause I thought it would be one more romantic story with a weak plot. But... I watched... It turned out, that it's not a simple story. I couldn't even diviner that it could be a good comedy with sense. Something fresh and new, good humour, brilliant acting. I really enjoyed it. It's about love and friendship.

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished. Now, imagine yourself stationed in space and just try to keep your heartrate below 80!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206553,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished. Now, imagine yourself stationed in space and just try to keep your heartrate below 80!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206553,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And while I think thats true, I think its a bit more complex than that. It also is a bit of a coming of age story where Joe has to grow up and be the adult in this family, but also it seems that mom is having a mid-life crisis (although shes not quite mid-life) and trying to discover who she is outside of being the "perfect 50s housewife" that perhaps she feels trapped in. There's a lot of symbolism in this movie. The backdrop of this movie is that there is a wildfire that has been raging and the townspeople have been desperately trying to put out. And that correlates with Joe and his own family. Hes trying to put out the fire in his own family. Also, Joe works at photography studio and Paul Dano (the director and co-writer) even said that this is supposed to be a PORTRAIT of a family life. \n\nSpeaking of Paul Dano, I think he did well with his directorial debut. I think visually there are some gorgeous shots in this movie. Like for instance where Joe is watching the wildfires (and hes perfectly centered - probably again to mimic the portrait vibe). Also where Joe is about to give up but it starts to snow and hope has regained. I liked the film for the most part. They do frame the film by following Joe's perspective. And I think its mostly effective in making you feel for this kid, my only problem is there are a couple of parts where I feel like there are gaps in the story. Without giving too much away there is a scene where Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal) has decided to seek revenge and it ends up backfiring. And yet, the next time we see him everything seems to be fine. And it never really gets explained what happened. Theres a brief line that they decided it was a "misunderstanding" but you never really see what happened and he also gets hurt during this, and that never gets brought up again either. I know Paul and Zoe (the other writer) were adapting this from a book and perhaps thats the way it is in there too. But I personally found that a little frustrating. I needed a little more. \n\nCarey Mulligan is fantastic in this. She would be deserving to have her name thrown in the hat for awards season. I also thought Ed Oxenbould was a standout too. Which is good to hear since he's onscreen for pretty much most of the movie. I definitely will be looking forward to more of his things. I also thought Jake Gyllenhaal was good but hes absent for a good chunk of the film and so he just didnt stand out as much as Carey or Ed did.\n\nOverall I liked the film. It wasn't perfect, but I would totally check out another film that Paul Dano directs.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26616,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-01-01","keywords":"1960s,unemployment,photography,infidelity,firefighter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1986312985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A boy witnesses his parents' marriage falling apart after his mother finds another man."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590837/","name":"Ed Oxenbould"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0585931/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0564372/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625497/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1443740/","name":"Zoe Kazan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285840/","name":"Richard Ford"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of "Django Unchained" and "The Butler". But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen's "12 Years a Slave" shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.\n\nSteve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.\n\nCentral to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.\n\nA fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender's portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.\n\nI was left speechless as the credits rolled. A lesser film would have added tacked-on sentimentality/exaggeration and politically influenced claptrap. Not this one. This is a movie to watch as a reminder of how powerful the human spirit can endeavor, and how lucky all of us have grown past that dreadful time in history.

The full effect of it has not been felt in movies before, until now.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":655561,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"duration":"PT2H14M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The detectives are:\n\nFrançoise Galliot(played by Clotilde de Bayser)(season 1;2;3;4) is the chief of the team. She is a very authoritative woman. She is a good friend of Scandella.\n\nHélène Vallon(played by Isabel Otéro)(season 5;6;7;8;9) is the second chief of the team after Galliot's departure.\n\nJean-Louis Scandella(played by Didier Cauchy): He is a good friend of Paulo and Françoise, and he felt in love with Caroline, and after with Vallon the 2nd chief. He become the new chief after Vallons 'departure.\n\nMichel Lemarchand(played by Jean-François Garreaud): A very mystery man.\n\nPaul "Paulo" Maureau(played by Teco Celio): The best friend of Scandella\n\nAlexandre "Sisko" Siskowski(played by Dominique Guillo): A young detective.\n\nCaroline Tessier(played by Agathe de La Boulaye)(episodes 1-13). She was in love with Scandella but she was murdered.\n\nAnd more... I think the show was good during the 9 first seasons when Galliot, and after Vallon, was the chief of team.

Roland Emmerich's latest disaster is about a cop (Channing Tatum) who is taking his daughter on a tour of the White House when terrorist take it over and try to take the President (Jamie Foxx) hostage. Now the cop, whose daughter can't really stand him, must try to impress her by saving the day and her favorite President. For starters, go watch OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN as it's a much better action movie and deals with the same subject. I'm sorry but if Emmerich were making movies back in the 70s they'd be lucky to play third bill at a drive-in just before the sun comes up. I really can't wrap my brain around how someone can make such bad movies one after another. Is he doing it on purpose? Surely he didn't make this film as bad as it is without doing it on purpose. Everything from the story to the acting to the CGI effects are just downright bad and all of it has Emmerich's style behind it. I mean, were we really supposed to find this movie touching and patriotic? The Foxx character is obviously "inspired" by Obama but if this was meant to be a tribute then they failed because it comes across as really embarrassing. Even worse are the bits of comedy, which includes some of the worst one-liners that you're ever going to hear. Even worse still are the awful action scenes with some of the worst looking CGI action effects that you're going to see this side of a SyFy production. Then, you have an incredibly awful subplot dealing with the cop's teenage daughter who is a complete brat but they try to make her out as some sort of patriotic hero. This entire bit of the story is just a complete embarrassment and it made me cringe as I watched it. I won't call out the actress but it was just a really bad position that the director put her in and it's almost as bad as Jaden Smith in AFTER EARTH. Let's pray that the two never team up. Both Tatum and Foxx are clearly just picking up paychecks and the great character actors like James Woods, Maggie Gyllenhaal and Allen Jenkins are just wasted in worthless roles. There are some moments here that are so incredibly bad that I couldn't help but laugh at them but sadly the film runs way too long to enjoy it as simply an awful movie with laughs.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":210116,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That Neville is a former scientist who is immune to the deadly strain is a bonus as it means he can work on a potential cure.\n\nYes it's daft, and yes it's contrived, but there sure is a lot of good stuff to enjoy before the films major failing surfaces. Firstly is Will Smith's performance, there is no doubting he is a major star these days, but here he also cements his standing as a bona fide A lister of note. He layers the performance so well, his character not only has to deal with the heavy threat of being killed by the mutants at night, he also has to fight his own isolation, mans inherent need for companionship is a tortured thing when you appear to be the sole beneficiary of gods green earth.\n\nSecondly the setting of a barren desolate New York is eerily staggering, overgrown with foliage and stalked by lions searching for food, it really is a big screen must to embrace the scope of it. Thirdly the mutants themselves are scary enough, but they honestly would have been better served being played by human actors rather than the CGI used that brings very mixed results, and fourthly the tension building is pitch perfect, the makers manage to have you on the edge of your seat gasping for a solution to this cracking story unfolding, but then...\n\nThey throw it all away by a rushed ending that had me positively seething, a quick turn of events should be a prelude to a fully fleshed out finale but instead we get a quick wham bam, oh The End. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth on leaving the cinema and frankly the audience deserves better, and in fact so does Will Smith, did they run out of money? Well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame that. 6.5/10\n\nFootnote: Having just watched the alternate version that is readily available on disc formats, I have to say that as weak and as frustrating as the theatrical ending is, the alternate ending is far worse, trite and totally misplaced, they chose the better ending of the two for sure.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":701719,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That Neville is a former scientist who is immune to the deadly strain is a bonus as it means he can work on a potential cure.\n\nYes it's daft, and yes it's contrived, but there sure is a lot of good stuff to enjoy before the films major failing surfaces. Firstly is Will Smith's performance, there is no doubting he is a major star these days, but here he also cements his standing as a bona fide A lister of note. He layers the performance so well, his character not only has to deal with the heavy threat of being killed by the mutants at night, he also has to fight his own isolation, mans inherent need for companionship is a tortured thing when you appear to be the sole beneficiary of gods green earth.\n\nSecondly the setting of a barren desolate New York is eerily staggering, overgrown with foliage and stalked by lions searching for food, it really is a big screen must to embrace the scope of it. Thirdly the mutants themselves are scary enough, but they honestly would have been better served being played by human actors rather than the CGI used that brings very mixed results, and fourthly the tension building is pitch perfect, the makers manage to have you on the edge of your seat gasping for a solution to this cracking story unfolding, but then...\n\nThey throw it all away by a rushed ending that had me positively seething, a quick turn of events should be a prelude to a fully fleshed out finale but instead we get a quick wham bam, oh The End. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth on leaving the cinema and frankly the audience deserves better, and in fact so does Will Smith, did they run out of money? Well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame that. 6.5/10\n\nFootnote: Having just watched the alternate version that is readily available on disc formats, I have to say that as weak and as frustrating as the theatrical ending is, the alternate ending is far worse, trite and totally misplaced, they chose the better ending of the two for sure.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":701719,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This isn't quite on-the-edge-of-your-seat material but there is a lot of good information given to you about the CIA to almost make it a how-to type of film at least in the first half.  The 2nd half wonders more into the action-thriller genre but always keeps you guessing. Farrell is recruited by a CIA agent to be trained as one and we get to see how they are trained in a place called the `Farm', which is a special school for the CIA. Pacino's character constantly is stressing to Farrell and the audience that not everything is as it seems.  This becomes kind of the theme throughout the movie as the viewer tries to figure out what's real and what's not.  This is quite a challenge in this film considering that being deceptive is part of the job of the CIA agent.  Another statement made by Pacino's character is that `everything is a test' also helps in the confusion of the reality issue.    After Farrell goes thru the `Farm', he is assigned a special case to investigate someone that he seems to care(Moynahan) about,  as a possible double-agent.  The truth is twisted a couple of times near the end of the film but we're able to figure it out when it's all over.  The 1st half and the 2nd half of this movie could actually each stand alone and that's what weakens the picture is the attempt to put both the CIA drama and the action-thriller together.

THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS films are an example of an "A" in this category. Last year's GEOSTORM was a "B" (it was so over-the-top that it was fun, especially when the meteorologist declared - as if he was reciting Shakespeare - "Oh my God, it's a GEOSTORM!"). Unfortunately, a "C" example of this is THE HURRICANE HEIST.\n\nDirected by Rob Cohen - who brought us the original FAST AND FURIOUS film lo' those many years ago - THE HURRICANE HEIST tells the tale of a HEIST set during a...anyone?...HURRICANE. That's pretty much all you need to know of the plot. The rest is action, escapes, weather gone bad, bad guys being bad guys and good guys being good guys.\n\nThe good guys are Toby Kebbel (so good as the motion capture bad-guy ape in DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES), perennial "B"-movie actress Maggie Grace (TAKEN, LOST and the immortal HOT GIRL, FAST CAR, EATING A BANANA) and Ryan Kwanten (I guess he was in TRUE BLOOD). What do these good guys have in common? They are not hard to look at on the screen. The two men also have really bad Southern accents.\n\nThe bad guys are led by Ralph Ineson ( a perennial "that guy" in such films as STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE) and a host of "red shirts". The problem is that Ineson plays his bad guy role as a "that guy" and the "red shirts" have no personality at all. One guy tries to be the "loose cannon" but he doesn't go far enough, nor does Ineson or ANY of the bad guys.\n\nOh...did I mention Ben Cross (Sarek in the new STAR TREK films)? Cross leaped off the screen in the Oscar winning film CHARIOTS OF FIRE way back in 1981 and was going to be "the next big thing". How has that worked out for him? I'm sure he's making a nice living, but...\n\nBut...you don't come to this kind of films for the acting. You come to it for the insane premise, the over-the-top acting, the out-of-this-world stunts and special effects. Unfortunately, THE HURRICANE HEIST plays each one of these "safely". The premise is insane, just not insane enough. The acting is melodramatic - just not over-the-top. The script doesn't really have any "oh-my-gosh, did he just say that" lines and the action, stunts and special effects are pretty good, (maybe even good), but not great.\n\nA pretty mediocre time at the movies. It did serve it's purpose, I turned my brain off for two hours. I just wish it didn't power down as well.\n\nLetter Grade: C (thanks for trying)\n\n5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19893,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2018-03-09","keywords":"disaster movie,hurricane,heist,category 5 hurricane,meteorologist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3874076697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM0NWYwZjQtNDhlNy00NGE1LWJiOTctMzRiOGJmZmUzYzk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM0NWYwZjQtNDhlNy00NGE1LWJiOTctMzRiOGJmZmUzYzk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Under the threat of a hurricane, opportunistic criminals infiltrate a US Mint facility to steal $600 million for the ultimate heist.

THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS films are an example of an "A" in this category. Last year's GEOSTORM was a "B" (it was so over-the-top that it was fun, especially when the meteorologist declared - as if he was reciting Shakespeare - "Oh my God, it's a GEOSTORM!"). Unfortunately, a "C" example of this is THE HURRICANE HEIST.\n\nDirected by Rob Cohen - who brought us the original FAST AND FURIOUS film lo' those many years ago - THE HURRICANE HEIST tells the tale of a HEIST set during a...anyone?...HURRICANE. That's pretty much all you need to know of the plot. The rest is action, escapes, weather gone bad, bad guys being bad guys and good guys being good guys.\n\nThe good guys are Toby Kebbel (so good as the motion capture bad-guy ape in DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES), perennial "B"-movie actress Maggie Grace (TAKEN, LOST and the immortal HOT GIRL, FAST CAR, EATING A BANANA) and Ryan Kwanten (I guess he was in TRUE BLOOD). What do these good guys have in common? They are not hard to look at on the screen. The two men also have really bad Southern accents.\n\nThe bad guys are led by Ralph Ineson ( a perennial "that guy" in such films as STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE) and a host of "red shirts". The problem is that Ineson plays his bad guy role as a "that guy" and the "red shirts" have no personality at all. One guy tries to be the "loose cannon" but he doesn't go far enough, nor does Ineson or ANY of the bad guys.\n\nOh...did I mention Ben Cross (Sarek in the new STAR TREK films)? Cross leaped off the screen in the Oscar winning film CHARIOTS OF FIRE way back in 1981 and was going to be "the next big thing". How has that worked out for him? I'm sure he's making a nice living, but...\n\nBut...you don't come to this kind of films for the acting. You come to it for the insane premise, the over-the-top acting, the out-of-this-world stunts and special effects. Unfortunately, THE HURRICANE HEIST plays each one of these "safely". The premise is insane, just not insane enough. The acting is melodramatic - just not over-the-top. The script doesn't really have any "oh-my-gosh, did he just say that" lines and the action, stunts and special effects are pretty good, (maybe even good), but not great.\n\nA pretty mediocre time at the movies. It did serve it's purpose, I turned my brain off for two hours. I just wish it didn't power down as well.\n\nLetter Grade: C (thanks for trying)\n\n5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19893,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2018-03-09","keywords":"disaster movie,hurricane,heist,category 5 hurricane,meteorologist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3874076697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM0NWYwZjQtNDhlNy00NGE1LWJiOTctMzRiOGJmZmUzYzk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM0NWYwZjQtNDhlNy00NGE1LWJiOTctMzRiOGJmZmUzYzk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Under the threat of a hurricane, opportunistic criminals infiltrate a US Mint facility to steal $600 million for the ultimate heist.

The only thing to save this travesty is Zachary Quinto and cool explosions. If it weren't for him, I'd give it a 1. \n\nReally bad acting, coupled with a terrible version of the story of Kahn, and why in the world is everything on the Enterprise glowing like a flashlight? \n\nAnd then they had the gall to use the original Star Trek theme at the end? I can see why many of the old actors have a serious problem with the new movies. \n\nThis is terrible, really terrible. Gene Roddenberry was greedy as can be, but I think he'd have a serious problem with this version. In the original, he wanted to show that humanity had finally overcome most of the things that caused us problems. The only place these things could still be found was in the expansion regions where it was still the wild west. \n\nBut in this... everything from the uniforms, the slang, the music, and everything else is EXACTLY as it is now but shinier. Really? This is ridiculous. \n\nAbrams should be ashamed.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":468032,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT2H12M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS films are an example of an "A" in this category. Last year's GEOSTORM was a "B" (it was so over-the-top that it was fun, especially when the meteorologist declared - as if he was reciting Shakespeare - "Oh my God, it's a GEOSTORM!"). Unfortunately, a "C" example of this is THE HURRICANE HEIST.\n\nDirected by Rob Cohen - who brought us the original FAST AND FURIOUS film lo' those many years ago - THE HURRICANE HEIST tells the tale of a HEIST set during a...anyone?...HURRICANE. That's pretty much all you need to know of the plot. The rest is action, escapes, weather gone bad, bad guys being bad guys and good guys being good guys.\n\nThe good guys are Toby Kebbel (so good as the motion capture bad-guy ape in DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES), perennial "B"-movie actress Maggie Grace (TAKEN, LOST and the immortal HOT GIRL, FAST CAR, EATING A BANANA) and Ryan Kwanten (I guess he was in TRUE BLOOD). What do these good guys have in common? They are not hard to look at on the screen. The two men also have really bad Southern accents.\n\nThe bad guys are led by Ralph Ineson ( a perennial "that guy" in such films as STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE) and a host of "red shirts". The problem is that Ineson plays his bad guy role as a "that guy" and the "red shirts" have no personality at all. One guy tries to be the "loose cannon" but he doesn't go far enough, nor does Ineson or ANY of the bad guys.\n\nOh...did I mention Ben Cross (Sarek in the new STAR TREK films)? Cross leaped off the screen in the Oscar winning film CHARIOTS OF FIRE way back in 1981 and was going to be "the next big thing". How has that worked out for him? I'm sure he's making a nice living, but...\n\nBut...you don't come to this kind of films for the acting. You come to it for the insane premise, the over-the-top acting, the out-of-this-world stunts and special effects. Unfortunately, THE HURRICANE HEIST plays each one of these "safely". The premise is insane, just not insane enough. The acting is melodramatic - just not over-the-top. The script doesn't really have any "oh-my-gosh, did he just say that" lines and the action, stunts and special effects are pretty good, (maybe even good), but not great.\n\nA pretty mediocre time at the movies. It did serve it's purpose, I turned my brain off for two hours. I just wish it didn't power down as well.\n\nLetter Grade: C (thanks for trying)\n\n5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19893,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2018-03-09","keywords":"disaster movie,hurricane,heist,category 5 hurricane,meteorologist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3874076697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM0NWYwZjQtNDhlNy00NGE1LWJiOTctMzRiOGJmZmUzYzk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM0NWYwZjQtNDhlNy00NGE1LWJiOTctMzRiOGJmZmUzYzk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Under the threat of a hurricane, opportunistic criminals infiltrate a US Mint facility to steal $600 million for the ultimate heist.

THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS films are an example of an "A" in this category. Last year's GEOSTORM was a "B" (it was so over-the-top that it was fun, especially when the meteorologist declared - as if he was reciting Shakespeare - "Oh my God, it's a GEOSTORM!"). Unfortunately, a "C" example of this is THE HURRICANE HEIST.\n\nDirected by Rob Cohen - who brought us the original FAST AND FURIOUS film lo' those many years ago - THE HURRICANE HEIST tells the tale of a HEIST set during a...anyone?...HURRICANE. That's pretty much all you need to know of the plot. The rest is action, escapes, weather gone bad, bad guys being bad guys and good guys being good guys.\n\nThe good guys are Toby Kebbel (so good as the motion capture bad-guy ape in DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES), perennial "B"-movie actress Maggie Grace (TAKEN, LOST and the immortal HOT GIRL, FAST CAR, EATING A BANANA) and Ryan Kwanten (I guess he was in TRUE BLOOD). What do these good guys have in common? They are not hard to look at on the screen. The two men also have really bad Southern accents.\n\nThe bad guys are led by Ralph Ineson ( a perennial "that guy" in such films as STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE) and a host of "red shirts". The problem is that Ineson plays his bad guy role as a "that guy" and the "red shirts" have no personality at all. One guy tries to be the "loose cannon" but he doesn't go far enough, nor does Ineson or ANY of the bad guys.\n\nOh...did I mention Ben Cross (Sarek in the new STAR TREK films)? Cross leaped off the screen in the Oscar winning film CHARIOTS OF FIRE way back in 1981 and was going to be "the next big thing". How has that worked out for him? I'm sure he's making a nice living, but...\n\nBut...you don't come to this kind of films for the acting. You come to it for the insane premise, the over-the-top acting, the out-of-this-world stunts and special effects. Unfortunately, THE HURRICANE HEIST plays each one of these "safely". The premise is insane, just not insane enough. The acting is melodramatic - just not over-the-top. The script doesn't really have any "oh-my-gosh, did he just say that" lines and the action, stunts and special effects are pretty good, (maybe even good), but not great.\n\nA pretty mediocre time at the movies. It did serve it's purpose, I turned my brain off for two hours. I just wish it didn't power down as well.\n\nLetter Grade: C (thanks for trying)\n\n5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19893,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2018-03-09","keywords":"disaster movie,hurricane,heist,category 5 hurricane,meteorologist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3874076697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM0NWYwZjQtNDhlNy00NGE1LWJiOTctMzRiOGJmZmUzYzk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM0NWYwZjQtNDhlNy00NGE1LWJiOTctMzRiOGJmZmUzYzk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Under the threat of a hurricane, opportunistic criminals infiltrate a US Mint facility to steal $600 million for the ultimate heist.

His first super-hero project, 'Kick Ass,' opened in 2010 to solid critical acclaim and a finalized gross of three times the film's ordinary $30 million dollar budget. And after only two years, Vaughn returns with 'X-Men: First Class,' an origins story to accompany the Bryan Singer/Brett Ratner X-Men trilogy released between 2000 and 2006. It's intelligent, enthralling, well-acted, stylishly directed, and most importantly by focusing heavily upon the relationship between the two central protagonists, it does not feel like a conventional super-hero film.\n\nSet within the political context of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the early 1960's, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) is an up-and-coming Professor whose life is drastically altered when he is introduced to the other members of society who also share the same mutant gene as himself that supplies them with super-human abilities and traits. After stumbling upon the shape-shifting Raven (Jennifer Lawrence) within his mansion, the telepathic Xavier then encounters Erik Lehnsherr (Michael Fassbender), the son of Jewish parents who were murdered during the holocaust by the narcissistic former Nazi scientist, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon). Erik, who can manipulate all metal objects around himself, wants retribution and nothing more from Sebastian who is now a successful and evil underground figurehead who commands a team of mutants (Azazel, Emma Frost and Riptide) to do his bidding for him. But, once his plan for world domination is revealed, they find that it far exceeds the constraints of humanity, and Xavier, Erik and a rag-tag band of young, hide-away mutants (Havok, Beast, Darwin, Angel and Banshee) who were discovered by Charles, must combine their powers in one last attempt to stop Shaw from destroying the planet and humanity as a whole.\n\nInstantly where 'X-Men: First Class' works is in regards to its two central characters; Charles Xavier played by an incredibly affluently sounding James McAvoy and a rage-fuelled Erik Lehnsherr played by a stern-faced Michael Fassbender. Their instant on-screen chemistry provides the drive and ammunition for the plot to carry itself forward. Both characters have differing ideologies and their constant clashes due to this aspect allow the script to be brought to life. Instead of simply infusing their relationship with formulaic violent clashes, Vaughn has instead opted for more articulated verbal battles between the two characters regarding their stance within the society they are now becoming a part of. Xavier is an intellectual being who believes that humans will eventually be accepted within society as equals alongside humans, while Lenhsherr believes that mutants will always be hunted and unable to live peacefully side-by-side with the human race, his evidence for this resides in the anti-Semitism and hatred he received at the hands of the Nazi party during the holocaust. This heavy-set contradiction in ideologies allows their relationship to be imbued with pessimism, while they may be shown as friends and fighting together initially, fans of the comic books and films in general know this does eventually turn into a bitter rivalry and it's this development which drives the plot forward.\n\nAside from the script, it would also be rude to not praise the action-sequences which take place within the confines of the 1960's X-Men universe. With a modest running time at two hours and ten minutes, there are more than a few well-choreographed action sequences that would adequately satisfy any of comic-book-to-film aficionado's wishing to see this film. Each character's power or ability is at some point represented in a destructive or defensive capacity, taking full advantage of the fact that while many super-hero movies tend to concentrate on the aesthetic nature of the artillery characters can be seen to withstand from governmental agencies or blindsided human opponents, here it is shown and constantly emphasized that human reaction would be futile due to the overwhelming power the mutants possess. These scenes also allow the less important characters to show their physical presence on-screen. For example, during the climactic fight sequence at the conclusion of the film, every mutant character that is identified to the audience is finally shown using their abilities to full capacity, most notably the henchmen of Shaw and the rag-tag team of Xavier and Lehnsherr. This therefore accounts slightly for the lack of depth that has been attempted in these secondary characters due to the time and story constraints.\n\nWhile it is a very good and accessible comic-book/super-hero movie, 'X-Men' does also contain two central flaws. The first is superseded in a way by the strength of both McAvoy and Fassbenders performances, as Kevin Bacon is constantly overshadowed as the one-dimensional antagonist of the piece. His plot to ultimately destroy humanity becomes second fiddle to the ever intricate complex relationship between Xavier and Lehnsherr, and his appearance seems too modelled upon that of a James Bond villain. He has the slick hair, the beautiful women and the villainous underground Club to boot, but Bacon unfortunately doesn't have the charisma to be accepted as a worthy opponent to the protagonists. The other flaw has to do with a minor aspect of the production itself, as the non-diegetic music, most notably during the action sequences, begins to diminish in its impact as the film carries on, leading to it eventually becoming the generic, genre-related fanfare associated with the conventional comic-book films.\n\n'X-Men: First Class,' is not your typical comic-book movie, it may contain certain elements associated with the comic-book genre, but by placing a heavy emphasis upon the strength of the plot and the script at the film's core instead of the action-set-pieces taking place, Vaughn has intended, and succeeded, in transcending the stereotypical conventions of the genre and has created a film which will appeal to a wide range of audience members.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":655044,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I enjoyed it. The interplay between him and Gossett was good stuff and it didn't have much of the martial arts nonsense I hate so much. I give it a 9 out of 10. I liked the story and to me, Chuck was funny. He's a far better actor than Seagal, but then, who isn't?

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Films like "Children of Men", "Looper", and "The Road" have greatly contributed to this sub-genre which, in reality, is not really new, but is constantly being redefined and given different treatments : "Children of Men" was an ode to life, "Looper" felt a lot like a modern-day western, "The Road" was a classic tale of a father-and-son relationship, and now, "Elysium", a thriller/action film/social commentary about disparity between the rich and the poor. Neill Blomkamp burst out of the scene in 2009 with "District 9", a very similar project in several regards, and blew audiences away with a clever mix of documentary-style filmmaking, explosive action, and the refreshing implement of an obvious social commentary.\n\n"Elysium" starts off brilliantly, showcasing two opposite environments: the old Earth, which has turned into a huge ghetto where people live like cattle, and Elysium, a high-end space station where all the wealthy people from Earth have moved to establish their home. We are then introduced to our protagonist, Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), whose quest is quickly defined after being exposed to deadly radiation : With five days left to live, Max will ally up with a group of illegal immigrants to get to Elysium so he can get the proper medical attention he needs. But Secretary Rhodes (Jodie Foster), an evil government executive in charge of defending Elysium, will stand in his way, by hiring Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a psychopathic mercenary in charge of neutralizing all illegal immigrants.\n\nThe first third of "Elysium" is both fascinating and stressful : You are being introduced to the over-populated Earth, its hospitals, its industrial plants, its streets. These images are very reminiscent of the Johannesburg ghettos depicted in "District 9". And then, you get to see glimpses of the wonderful Elysium, a visual tour-de-force that ends up being shamefully underused in the film. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation, the film jumps into a nerve-racking tone, and it is very effective, as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common.\n\nUnfortunately, the pace slows down in the second third, where Max's story gets sidelined a bit, to the profit of a few sub-plots that involve an unpredictable, yet not so major twist in terms of impact on the story, as well as a sub-story involving the daughter of an old friend of Max. And while the twist is a welcome addition, the sub-story comes a little out of nowhere and comes off as a bit of a cliché. It seemed like Blomkamp was trying to preserve this family theme that was dear to him in "District 9", and that served the story so well in his previous film. Its unusual aspect prevented it from being too clichéd (an alien dad and his alien son), which is unfortunately not the case in "Elysium". It does not ruin the film, but it does steal its share of precious screen time in a film that feels a tad too short, and leads it towards more conventional developments.\n\nThen the pace picks up again, with a third act that consists mostly of a bunch of pretty awesome action/fighting sequences, where the feeling of urgency from the original quest has pretty much left the building. In terms of writing, this is conventional stuff, but the technical expertise behind the visuals and the sound is a thing of beauty. Also, the dramatic elements displayed in the first third are briefly brought back to seal the deal, and do provide a satisfying feeling of closure to the story.\n\nOverall, this is quality entertainment with impressive visuals, and a world of ideas that had infinite potential. And while "Elysium" exploited only a fraction of its potential, what it did exploit it did it successfully. Directing, photography, music, and performances are all superb. With a decent yet a bit unoriginal social commentary in the background that does get shelved in the second half to the profit of rock-solid action sequences, the strengths of "Elysium", taken individually, do feel a bit scattered, but make for an overall very competent package.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":424635,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Films like "Children of Men", "Looper", and "The Road" have greatly contributed to this sub-genre which, in reality, is not really new, but is constantly being redefined and given different treatments : "Children of Men" was an ode to life, "Looper" felt a lot like a modern-day western, "The Road" was a classic tale of a father-and-son relationship, and now, "Elysium", a thriller/action film/social commentary about disparity between the rich and the poor. Neill Blomkamp burst out of the scene in 2009 with "District 9", a very similar project in several regards, and blew audiences away with a clever mix of documentary-style filmmaking, explosive action, and the refreshing implement of an obvious social commentary.\n\n"Elysium" starts off brilliantly, showcasing two opposite environments: the old Earth, which has turned into a huge ghetto where people live like cattle, and Elysium, a high-end space station where all the wealthy people from Earth have moved to establish their home. We are then introduced to our protagonist, Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), whose quest is quickly defined after being exposed to deadly radiation : With five days left to live, Max will ally up with a group of illegal immigrants to get to Elysium so he can get the proper medical attention he needs. But Secretary Rhodes (Jodie Foster), an evil government executive in charge of defending Elysium, will stand in his way, by hiring Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a psychopathic mercenary in charge of neutralizing all illegal immigrants.\n\nThe first third of "Elysium" is both fascinating and stressful : You are being introduced to the over-populated Earth, its hospitals, its industrial plants, its streets. These images are very reminiscent of the Johannesburg ghettos depicted in "District 9". And then, you get to see glimpses of the wonderful Elysium, a visual tour-de-force that ends up being shamefully underused in the film. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation, the film jumps into a nerve-racking tone, and it is very effective, as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common.\n\nUnfortunately, the pace slows down in the second third, where Max's story gets sidelined a bit, to the profit of a few sub-plots that involve an unpredictable, yet not so major twist in terms of impact on the story, as well as a sub-story involving the daughter of an old friend of Max. And while the twist is a welcome addition, the sub-story comes a little out of nowhere and comes off as a bit of a cliché. It seemed like Blomkamp was trying to preserve this family theme that was dear to him in "District 9", and that served the story so well in his previous film. Its unusual aspect prevented it from being too clichéd (an alien dad and his alien son), which is unfortunately not the case in "Elysium". It does not ruin the film, but it does steal its share of precious screen time in a film that feels a tad too short, and leads it towards more conventional developments.\n\nThen the pace picks up again, with a third act that consists mostly of a bunch of pretty awesome action/fighting sequences, where the feeling of urgency from the original quest has pretty much left the building. In terms of writing, this is conventional stuff, but the technical expertise behind the visuals and the sound is a thing of beauty. Also, the dramatic elements displayed in the first third are briefly brought back to seal the deal, and do provide a satisfying feeling of closure to the story.\n\nOverall, this is quality entertainment with impressive visuals, and a world of ideas that had infinite potential. And while "Elysium" exploited only a fraction of its potential, what it did exploit it did it successfully. Directing, photography, music, and performances are all superb. With a decent yet a bit unoriginal social commentary in the background that does get shelved in the second half to the profit of rock-solid action sequences, the strengths of "Elysium", taken individually, do feel a bit scattered, but make for an overall very competent package.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":424635,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.\n\nAnd one final note. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.\n\nAnd one final note. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"duration":"PT2H18M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Films like "Children of Men", "Looper", and "The Road" have greatly contributed to this sub-genre which, in reality, is not really new, but is constantly being redefined and given different treatments : "Children of Men" was an ode to life, "Looper" felt a lot like a modern-day western, "The Road" was a classic tale of a father-and-son relationship, and now, "Elysium", a thriller/action film/social commentary about disparity between the rich and the poor. Neill Blomkamp burst out of the scene in 2009 with "District 9", a very similar project in several regards, and blew audiences away with a clever mix of documentary-style filmmaking, explosive action, and the refreshing implement of an obvious social commentary.\n\n"Elysium" starts off brilliantly, showcasing two opposite environments: the old Earth, which has turned into a huge ghetto where people live like cattle, and Elysium, a high-end space station where all the wealthy people from Earth have moved to establish their home. We are then introduced to our protagonist, Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), whose quest is quickly defined after being exposed to deadly radiation : With five days left to live, Max will ally up with a group of illegal immigrants to get to Elysium so he can get the proper medical attention he needs. But Secretary Rhodes (Jodie Foster), an evil government executive in charge of defending Elysium, will stand in his way, by hiring Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a psychopathic mercenary in charge of neutralizing all illegal immigrants.\n\nThe first third of "Elysium" is both fascinating and stressful : You are being introduced to the over-populated Earth, its hospitals, its industrial plants, its streets. These images are very reminiscent of the Johannesburg ghettos depicted in "District 9". And then, you get to see glimpses of the wonderful Elysium, a visual tour-de-force that ends up being shamefully underused in the film. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation, the film jumps into a nerve-racking tone, and it is very effective, as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common.\n\nUnfortunately, the pace slows down in the second third, where Max's story gets sidelined a bit, to the profit of a few sub-plots that involve an unpredictable, yet not so major twist in terms of impact on the story, as well as a sub-story involving the daughter of an old friend of Max. And while the twist is a welcome addition, the sub-story comes a little out of nowhere and comes off as a bit of a cliché. It seemed like Blomkamp was trying to preserve this family theme that was dear to him in "District 9", and that served the story so well in his previous film. Its unusual aspect prevented it from being too clichéd (an alien dad and his alien son), which is unfortunately not the case in "Elysium". It does not ruin the film, but it does steal its share of precious screen time in a film that feels a tad too short, and leads it towards more conventional developments.\n\nThen the pace picks up again, with a third act that consists mostly of a bunch of pretty awesome action/fighting sequences, where the feeling of urgency from the original quest has pretty much left the building. In terms of writing, this is conventional stuff, but the technical expertise behind the visuals and the sound is a thing of beauty. Also, the dramatic elements displayed in the first third are briefly brought back to seal the deal, and do provide a satisfying feeling of closure to the story.\n\nOverall, this is quality entertainment with impressive visuals, and a world of ideas that had infinite potential. And while "Elysium" exploited only a fraction of its potential, what it did exploit it did it successfully. Directing, photography, music, and performances are all superb. With a decent yet a bit unoriginal social commentary in the background that does get shelved in the second half to the profit of rock-solid action sequences, the strengths of "Elysium", taken individually, do feel a bit scattered, but make for an overall very competent package.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":424635,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.\n\nAnd one final note.

Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The protagonists are trying to escape a big and seemingly pointless maze, full of boobytraps, dead ends and moving targets. Is this someone's sick joke? A grand conspiracy? Or just a product of other humans who only did their jobs one day at a time? The whole thing must have cost cubic dollars *ba dum-tsss*. Why were these people placed there? Because reasons. Otherwise the whole thing would be pointless, right? So keep moving. Or don't?\n\nI found the film both stimulating and entertaining, and I expect it be memorable.

If you're looking for a standard "let's play a game" horror flick filled with jump scares and gore, this isn't it.\n\nYou'll spend 90 minutes with a bunch of "normal" people (i.e. humankind) that possess a variety of virtues and vices. The protagonists are trying to escape a big and seemingly pointless maze, full of boobytraps, dead ends and moving targets. Is this someone's sick joke? A grand conspiracy? Or just a product of other humans who only did their jobs one day at a time? The whole thing must have cost cubic dollars *ba dum-tsss*. Why were these people placed there? Because reasons. Otherwise the whole thing would be pointless, right? So keep moving. Or don't?\n\nI found the film both stimulating and entertaining, and I expect it be memorable. Give it a watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":217509,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It mixes humor both broad and subtle humor into a strange brew of comedy, poignancy, lessons, and life. Huge and deep issues are addressed, topics like death, dreams, and failure. Yet somehow the movie doesn't feel heavy. You'll walk out with a smile on your face because the movie sensibly touches on these issues, realizing that stuff happens and life continues, that the handling of adversity is often what defines people. And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.\n\n"Sunshine" may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.\n\nRather crude at times, "Sunshine" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.\n\nBottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":451870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"beauty pageant,cross country trip,gay,drugs,graduate student","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Little Miss Sunshine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3667263769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001057/","name":"Toni Collette"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206760/","name":"Jonathan Dayton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267512/","name":"Valerie Faris"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148020/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063938/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1578335/","name":"Michael Arndt"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Despite being warned very strongly against going to see this film and despite the trailer looking unappetising, I still saw it anyway. It was always going to be a film that would go either way, the amount of talent on board, my general love for family films and for Postman Pat could have suggested that the film would be fun and charming, but there was the worry also that it would look as muddled, target-audience-confused and hasty-looking as the trailer suggested. The film has its moments and it is not from personal opinion quite as bad as heard, but it was a big disappointment. The film begins very promisingly with a very idyllic opening that was the closest the film ever got in resembling the show, the Big Time song is a great upbeat song that has some very funny visual gags, the montage where Pat meets his wife for the first time was very touching and the "Faster Pussy-Bot, Kill Kill!" seemed like a Daleks reference and it was if the case a clever one at that. The soundtrack is catchy and bring energy to the film and the voice cast are good and very enthusiastic, David Tennant sounds like he's having a whale of a time but Steven Mangan, who's very sympathetic and dead-on as Pat, and Jim Broadbent acquit themselves very well too.\n\nSadly, Postman Pat: The Movie is let down by that it didn't seem to know what to do with itself or know who to aim the film at. The story is rather over-complicated and confused focusing mainly on the talent show subplot and also including a Dr Who-like robot invasion/world domination one, neither of which show any originality, cleverness or charm. The satire for the former is nowhere near sharp enough, the humour actually felt to me rather forced mostly throughout the film and borders on vulgar while the latter felt thrown in and like it belonged in another film altogether, is not all that cleverly or thrillingly done and may contain bits that the younger audience may find scary or upsetting. The script would have benefited from a far more simpler approach and less going on and while it is admirable that the film did clearly think of the adult audience I think it could have done a better job at having more for the youngsters. Some of the jokes will go over their heads, unless they were introduced to Dr Who at a very young age, and if they are familiar with the whimsy and warmth that the show had the film sadly is a far cry from that. The characters are bland, the exceptions being Pat who is very likable and possibly Jess as well but the others lacked personality. The film was unevenly paced with some of the earlier parts in need of more zip and some of the later parts in need of a slow-down, most apparent in a climax that was action-packed but too busy and dark compared to the rest of the film.

Despite being warned very strongly against going to see this film and despite the trailer looking unappetising, I still saw it anyway. It was always going to be a film that would go either way, the amount of talent on board, my general love for family films and for Postman Pat could have suggested that the film would be fun and charming, but there was the worry also that it would look as muddled, target-audience-confused and hasty-looking as the trailer suggested. The film has its moments and it is not from personal opinion quite as bad as heard, but it was a big disappointment. The film begins very promisingly with a very idyllic opening that was the closest the film ever got in resembling the show, the Big Time song is a great upbeat song that has some very funny visual gags, the montage where Pat meets his wife for the first time was very touching and the "Faster Pussy-Bot, Kill Kill!" seemed like a Daleks reference and it was if the case a clever one at that. The soundtrack is catchy and bring energy to the film and the voice cast are good and very enthusiastic, David Tennant sounds like he's having a whale of a time but Steven Mangan, who's very sympathetic and dead-on as Pat, and Jim Broadbent acquit themselves very well too.\n\nSadly, Postman Pat: The Movie is let down by that it didn't seem to know what to do with itself or know who to aim the film at. The story is rather over-complicated and confused focusing mainly on the talent show subplot and also including a Dr Who-like robot invasion/world domination one, neither of which show any originality, cleverness or charm. The satire for the former is nowhere near sharp enough, the humour actually felt to me rather forced mostly throughout the film and borders on vulgar while the latter felt thrown in and like it belonged in another film altogether, is not all that cleverly or thrillingly done and may contain bits that the younger audience may find scary or upsetting. The script would have benefited from a far more simpler approach and less going on and while it is admirable that the film did clearly think of the adult audience I think it could have done a better job at having more for the youngsters. Some of the jokes will go over their heads, unless they were introduced to Dr Who at a very young age, and if they are familiar with the whimsy and warmth that the show had the film sadly is a far cry from that. The characters are bland, the exceptions being Pat who is very likable and possibly Jess as well but the others lacked personality. The film was unevenly paced with some of the earlier parts in need of more zip and some of the later parts in need of a slow-down, most apparent in a climax that was action-packed but too busy and dark compared to the rest of the film. The soundtrack is one of the best things about Postman Pat: The Movie and Ronan Keating does a great job as Pat's singing voice but it is a case of the singing voice not matching the speaking voice especially in the tone. Just as disappointing as the writing was the animation, the opening was really promising but the rest looked like it was made in a lot of haste and had some very over-saturated and too bright colours, the characters also lack expression and on occasions look creepy, Pat is the one exception. Overall, a disappointing feature film debut of a much cherished classic character, not an awful film and has some good assets but it felt over-stuffed, muddled and bland with some cheap direct-to-video-like visuals with the opening being the only time where it bared any resemblance to the show. 4/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1629,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Without spoiling the movie, the antics in the Wolverine State were more like bad SNL skits than part of this movie.\n\nThe characters, both primary and secondary, were very likable and were also very well developed. Some of the fringe characters (I talking to you, Dakota!) tended to be overly done and one-note. They could have been scaled back to fit their place in the movie thus adding to rather than subtracting from the story. (Math in a movie review? Who would have guessed?) Tom's job hunt problems seemed to be oriented toward setting up jokes than based in reality. A man with his background would have landed a position in Ann Arbor in a New York minute. However, Violet's drama was much better written and more believable.\n\nOnce back in San Francisco, everything picked up again and you began rooting for the home team to finally make it to the goal line.\n\nSo go enjoy the beginning and end but be ready to take a 30-minute nap in the middle. Maybe the Director's Cut with actually cut out the boring parts. One can hope."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95849,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Without spoiling the movie, the antics in the Wolverine State were more like bad SNL skits than part of this movie.\n\nThe characters, both primary and secondary, were very likable and were also very well developed. Some of the fringe characters (I talking to you, Dakota!) tended to be overly done and one-note. They could have been scaled back to fit their place in the movie thus adding to rather than subtracting from the story. (Math in a movie review? Who would have guessed?) Tom's job hunt problems seemed to be oriented toward setting up jokes than based in reality. A man with his background would have landed a position in Ann Arbor in a New York minute. However, Violet's drama was much better written and more believable.\n\nOnce back in San Francisco, everything picked up again and you began rooting for the home team to finally make it to the goal line.\n\nSo go enjoy the beginning and end but be ready to take a 30-minute nap in the middle. Maybe the Director's Cut with actually cut out the boring parts. One can hope.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95849,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The cast was great once again with Paul Walker returning to his role as Brian O'Connor and Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendes adding new character dynamics. Tyrese in particular was great. If there's one thing the first film lacked it's that there wasn't much humor. It was a very serious film and while that's great, Tyrese's character, Roman Pearce, added some great laughs at some unexpected moments. The cinematic effects were much better in this film also.

It was a very serious film and while that's great, Tyrese's character, Roman Pearce, added some great laughs at some unexpected moments. The cinematic effects were much better in this film also. The only negatives were that some of the action sequences were a little overboard (Dukes of Hazard jump for example) and the dialogue had too much street car jargon to the extent that some of it felt forced. "That Yenko will snap a speedo in 5 seconds" is an example of the type of dialogue that doesn't actually feel genuine in its placement in the film. Nonetheless, a really good movie with solid acting and great action.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.\n\nStory: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her "resurrection" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.\n\nActing: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.\n\nAction: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.\n\nCinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.\n\nDirection: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.\n\nOverall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5\n\nP.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":375498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.\n\nStory: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her "resurrection" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.\n\nActing: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.\n\nAction: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.\n\nCinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.\n\nDirection: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.\n\nOverall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5\n\nP.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":375498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.\n\nStory: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her "resurrection" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.\n\nActing: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.\n\nAction: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.\n\nCinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.\n\nDirection: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.\n\nOverall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5\n\nP.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":375498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He's a surgeon from sophisticated, worldly London who moves to (fictional) Portwenn on the coast of Cornwall because he suddenly becomes ill at the sight of blood. This is not a good omen for a surgeon. He quits to become a general practitioner and he's satisfied, thanks very much, with checkups, prescriptions and referrals.\n\nThe foul-mannered, blunt-spoken Doc smugly considers himself above the crowd, but he soon learns he is really BELOW the crowd, out of step with Portwenn's eccentricities, value systems and peculiar burghers, who make the mere lunatics of London look normal by comparison.\n\nMartin Clunes is terrific in the lead role. He is a tall, charismatic and not exactly handsome actor who looks like he would be more comfortable playing cops and heavies. He is, instead, a consummate comic actor. His facial and physical comedy, his frequent bouts of exasperation and bewilderment, are things to behold. (Note: some wags have compared him to 'House,' from the popular TV drama of the same name. House is played by Hugh Laurie, another splendid Brit, and that's about where the comparison begins and ends. They are two very different characters in two very different shows.)\n\nPortwenn's local population, with its twisted logic that somehow makes perfect sense, is represented through the tour-de-force acting of supporting players: Bert (Ian McNeice, who always dazzles playing offbeat, world-weary philosophical characters); Louise (the charming and beautiful Caroline Catz), who either loves Martin or wants to kill him; corn-rowed Elaine (lovely Lucy Punch) as the ditzy assistant with her own set of secretarial ethics; and Doc's Aunt Joan (the great Stephanie Cole, who has been delighting audiences since the 1960s).\n\nDominic Minghella, he of the Minghella mob of talented artists (brother Anthony directed 'The English Patient'), is the brains behind this brilliant controlled chaos.\n\nDon't miss this program. TV shows that are both funny AND intelligent are the rarest of TV fare.\n\nAnd a fast footnote: let us all bow our heads and pray that Hollywood doesn't try to remake this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Dallas. The Young and the Restless.  The Dukes of Hazzard.  He-Man.  The Greatest American Hero.  Airwolf.  Knight Rider.\n\nIn 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they did not commit.  They promptly escaped a maximum security stockade into the Los Angeles Underground.  Today, still wanted by the government, they exist as soldiers of fortune.  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...\n\nThe A-Team.\n\nWith a script any eight year old would love, the four members of the A-Team went off every week to somewhere in America to help someone who couldn't find help anywhere else.  They battled impossible odds (with impossible storylines) and managed to stay one step ahead of the law.  They were always predictable, heroic, and fun.  God bless the eighties, and long live TV Land.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35564,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"1983-01-23","keywords":"gmc vandura,cult tv,good versus evil,mercenary,hero for hire","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000577/","name":"George Peppard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001558/","name":"Mr. T","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776239/","name":"Dwight Schultz"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004798/","name":"Stephen J.

Watching it makes me feel like a kid again, back when I had no worries in life beyond going to elementary school and doing homework.  Knight Rider is as 80's as Mr. T, Punky Brewster, Run DMC and WHAM!  Michael and KITT give me that warm feeling inside and they take me back to my childhood. Unfortunately this is not a show with much substance or intelligence.  It is true that this series does not feature the best acting and writing around, and it caters to children and the kind of crowd that love movies like "The Fast and the Furious" or "Armaggedon".  Yes, this is a kiddie show.\n\n But after reading many of the comments here I feel that people are just being waaaaaay too hard on Knight Rider.  Now that 80's kids have grown up, we're adults and we are looking back at this show through adult eyes.  So a lot of people are really slamming Knight Rider for being a stupid goofball series and I think that is very unfair.  I think Knight Rider is entertaining fluff.  Just take your brain out, ignore the toy model cars and bad stunt doubles and simply enjoy the show for what it is.  A fun 1 hour diversion from the hardships of daily life, and a brief nostalgia trip to the 80's.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31487,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1982-09-26","keywords":"vehicle driving by itself,private detective,crime fighter,pontiac trans am,1980s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001327/","name":"David Hasselhoff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0611811/","name":"Edward Mulhare","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000865/","name":"Richard Basehart"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088140/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488991/","name":"Glen A.

All of the shows listed  above are some of the best shows ever in the history of TV and how  anyone has the audacity to sit here and type in a bunch of drivvle and  say that Knight Rider had bad actors, bad stunts, and bad filming shows  to me they know nothing about the show. The only problem Knight Rider  had was, it was way ahead of its time. Knight Rider was a lot like  KITT it was the show of the future.

Watching it makes me feel like a kid again, back when I had no worries in life beyond going to elementary school and doing homework.  Knight Rider is as 80's as Mr. T, Punky Brewster, Run DMC and WHAM!  Michael and KITT give me that warm feeling inside and they take me back to my childhood. Unfortunately this is not a show with much substance or intelligence.  It is true that this series does not feature the best acting and writing around, and it caters to children and the kind of crowd that love movies like "The Fast and the Furious" or "Armaggedon".  Yes, this is a kiddie show.\n\n But after reading many of the comments here I feel that people are just being waaaaaay too hard on Knight Rider.  Now that 80's kids have grown up, we're adults and we are looking back at this show through adult eyes.  So a lot of people are really slamming Knight Rider for being a stupid goofball series and I think that is very unfair.  I think Knight Rider is entertaining fluff.  Just take your brain out, ignore the toy model cars and bad stunt doubles and simply enjoy the show for what it is.  A fun 1 hour diversion from the hardships of daily life, and a brief nostalgia trip to the 80's.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31487,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1982-09-26","keywords":"vehicle driving by itself,private detective,crime fighter,pontiac trans am,1980s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001327/","name":"David Hasselhoff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0611811/","name":"Edward Mulhare","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000865/","name":"Richard Basehart"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088140/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488991/","name":"Glen A.

All of the shows listed  above are some of the best shows ever in the history of TV and how  anyone has the audacity to sit here and type in a bunch of drivvle and  say that Knight Rider had bad actors, bad stunts, and bad filming shows  to me they know nothing about the show. The only problem Knight Rider  had was, it was way ahead of its time. Knight Rider was a lot like  KITT it was the show of the future. Now I will go on and defend Kinght  Rider like any true fan would. David Hasselhoff may not have been one  of the best actors, but none-the-less he is a fairly decent actor. In  turn, the KITT car was a real Pontiac and at times it was a dumb car,  most people know this stuff, however this is a TV show not real life,  so if it may have seemed fake in manner, then maybe you should sell  your TV and sit in your house like a bored bump on a log.

That is not to say it is a bad achievement, for the end product is fun, exhilarating and stylish. I do however feel it is extremely important to debunk the 'comic book' label since it is both unjustly applied and it will perhaps generate false expectations from the mainstream audience.\n\nAlthough The Punisher is adapted from Marvel Comics, the R-rating alone should be blunt indicator of the path it intends to take. Half an hour into the film it still leaves us clueless and oblivious to the dark turn it will twist into. During which Thomas Jane undergoes an apt transformation of character from heartfelt family man on that one last undercover op to a hard-boiled, brooding vigilante who downs whiskey, swears, tortures and broods. The catalyst for this development is the brutal murder of his family and now he's out to get the hierarchy of villains (headed by John Travolta)  only he isn't just out for vengeance or justice  he's out to punish. In a corrupt city of thugs, Frank Castle becomes the judge, jury and executor.\n\nWhat is so refreshing about Thomas Jane in the part of Punisher is that he is a sprawling surge of old school with a splash of Clint Eastwood protagonist  the detached, effortless action hero who is too cool for romantic interests, with hardcore one-liners and a merciless approach to duels. In this way, he is easily one of the most successful 'superhero' actors of the new millennium. But alas, Jane went unnoticed and Punisher did poorly at the box office probably BECAUSE it adopted this off-beat, old-school style to acting and action.\n\nI also want to comment on said action, which was spectacular. Truth to be told, I have been waiting a long time to say that about a film. Usually it's the obligatory "the visuals are stunning" or "it's extremely fast-paced and kinetic" but here the sheer hand-to-hand combat is the film's goldmine because it moves back into close character mode instead of the epic scenarios that Batman, Superman and Spiderman dish out to keep out interest. It's gloriously gritty, graphic and dirty which unfortunately also begs the question of where the $33,000,000 budget went. Did they spend it all on late night taco runs?\n\nFor that matter, The Punisher is far from devoid of faults. Its fatal flaw stems, in part, from what made it a good film in the first place: its sparseness of effects, general minimalism and lack of superhero formula. Rather it is a model-kit assembled from seedy old-school revenge action movies, the type you'd sort of casually catch a bit of on TV one night. \n\n7 out of 10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":151841,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But alas, Jane went unnoticed and Punisher did poorly at the box office probably BECAUSE it adopted this off-beat, old-school style to acting and action.\n\nI also want to comment on said action, which was spectacular. Truth to be told, I have been waiting a long time to say that about a film. Usually it's the obligatory "the visuals are stunning" or "it's extremely fast-paced and kinetic" but here the sheer hand-to-hand combat is the film's goldmine because it moves back into close character mode instead of the epic scenarios that Batman, Superman and Spiderman dish out to keep out interest. It's gloriously gritty, graphic and dirty which unfortunately also begs the question of where the $33,000,000 budget went. Did they spend it all on late night taco runs?\n\nFor that matter, The Punisher is far from devoid of faults. Its fatal flaw stems, in part, from what made it a good film in the first place: its sparseness of effects, general minimalism and lack of superhero formula. Rather it is a model-kit assembled from seedy old-school revenge action movies, the type you'd sort of casually catch a bit of on TV one night. \n\n7 out of 10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":151841,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
