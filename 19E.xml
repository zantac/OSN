The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there. Now give them the surrounding plots and characters that made S1 so good CBS.

He then sends a note and a sneaker of the girl to Detective Alex Cross, hence forcing him out of his self-inflicted isolation, the reasons of which are explained in the opening scene. Along with the FBI agent who was in charge of security at the scene of the crime, he follows the clues laid out by the kidnapper in order to find the girl. And so the story goes. \n\nThe kidnapper is portrayed by the always formidable Michael Wincott, the best serial villain on that side of the Atlantic. He should have the Best Supporting Role awards piled up in his attic. Alex Cross, whom we remember from "Kiss the Girls", and portrayed by Morgan Freeman, is just the kind of cop you like best: sincere, sympathetic, intelligent, thorough and committed. Monica Potter features as the FBI agent determined to redeem herself after she let the kidnapper escape. \n\nThis may not be a blockbuster, but this solid and underrated thriller delivers what so few of them have to offer these days: a final plot twist that genuinely surprises. It shall not be revealed here.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":81004,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-09-05","keywords":"police officer,kidnapping,ransom,based on novel,impersonating a police officer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4129013273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVhYjdmNGUtYWU5Ni00ODVmLWE2ZDQtNDNlMzg4MGUzNDIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVhYjdmNGUtYWU5Ni00ODVmLWE2ZDQtNDNlMzg4MGUzNDIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000699/","name":"Michael Wincott"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005321/","name":"Monica Potter"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848414/","name":"Lee Tamahori"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031919/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031847/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0666248/","name":"James Patterson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609031/","name":"Marc Moss"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Along Came a Spider: Directed by Lee Tamahori. With Morgan Freeman, Monica Potter, Michael Wincott, Dylan Baker. When a senator's daughter under Secret Service protection is kidnapped from a private school, detective Alex Cross investigates the case even though he's recovering from the loss of his partner." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0164334/","name":"Along Came a Spider","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTVlY2VhMWEtYmRlOC00YWVhLWEzMDktZWJlYzNiMWJmZTIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_.jpg","description":"When a senator's daughter under Secret Service protection is kidnapped from a private school, detective Alex Cross investigates the case even though he's recovering from the loss of his partner.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0164334/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Nahret","dateCreated":"2002-07-05","inLanguage":"English","name":"Underrated. 7 of 10.","reviewBody":"The plot starts out in a very straight-forward manner: a man with an ambition to become criminal legend kidnaps the daughter of a congressman right out from under the nose of the FBI. He then sends a note and a sneaker of the girl to Detective Alex Cross, hence forcing him out of his self-inflicted isolation, the reasons of which are explained in the opening scene. Along with the FBI agent who was in charge of security at the scene of the crime, he follows the clues laid out by the kidnapper in order to find the girl. And so the story goes. \n\nThe kidnapper is portrayed by the always formidable Michael Wincott, the best serial villain on that side of the Atlantic. He should have the Best Supporting Role awards piled up in his attic. Alex Cross, whom we remember from "Kiss the Girls", and portrayed by Morgan Freeman, is just the kind of cop you like best: sincere, sympathetic, intelligent, thorough and committed. Monica Potter features as the FBI agent determined to redeem herself after she let the kidnapper escape. \n\nThis may not be a blockbuster, but this solid and underrated thriller delivers what so few of them have to offer these days: a final plot twist that genuinely surprises. It shall not be revealed here.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":81004,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-09-05","keywords":"police officer,kidnapping,ransom,based on novel,impersonating a police officer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4129013273","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVhYjdmNGUtYWU5Ni00ODVmLWE2ZDQtNDNlMzg4MGUzNDIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVhYjdmNGUtYWU5Ni00ODVmLWE2ZDQtNDNlMzg4MGUzNDIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000699/","name":"Michael Wincott","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005321/","name":"Monica Potter"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848414/","name":"Lee Tamahori"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031919/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031847/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0666248/","name":"James Patterson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0609031/","name":"Marc Moss"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is when the series starts to pick up steam. Watching the show, you can't help but laugh at Briscoe's remarks or feel the passion of McCoy. Both of these men want justice, and will do everything within limits to bring the wrongdoers to justice. What I really like about the show is the wonderful twists and turns that they throw to the audience, as well as the "ripped from the headlines" episodes. Even though you have 2 more in the "Law And Order" franchise, the original is STILL the best!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33425,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1990-09-13","keywords":"shared universe,copaganda,profanity,ampersand in title,punctuation in title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001583/","name":"Jerry Orbach","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0552509/","name":"Jesse L.

If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the "Most Wanted" episode. That episode was the Pilot for "FBI: Most Wanted" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there. Now give them the surrounding plots and characters that made S1 so good CBS. Put S1 on All Access too while you're at it!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12189,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

No one, besides Bette maybe, was established and you're watching this group of gay friends find their way in life with all the drama in tow. Some storylines were risqué for the time, which made it all the more interesting.

We're now expected to find this in these new characters but the writing just doesn't quite live up to that same quirky standard. I understand this is a different show and perhaps they had to sell it that way to bring it back, perhaps they felt they needed a younger generation for a younger audience to relate to. It's not a bad show and the new characters aren't terrible, but there's a certain depth missing here. There was more to the L Word than affairs, it was about power dynamics, whilst at the same time being goofy and at times off the wall.

    <title lang="fr">House of Series</title>
    <desc lang="fr">Aux Etats-Unis, de plus en plus de séries s'intéressent aux rouages de la politique et aux coulisses du pouvoir à la Maison-Blanche. En 1999, The West Wing a été l'une des premières fictions à dépeindre le quotidien du président américain et de son équipe. Cette série culte a inspiré nombre de scénaristes qui ont donné naissance à "House of cards", "Veep", "The loudest voice", ou encore "The Comey rule". Pourquoi la Maison-Blanche et son locataire inspirent-ils tant le sérail de la fiction ? Ce documentaire analyse cette tendance à travers les témoignages de producteurs et de showrunners comme Elie Attie (The west Wing), ou encore Michael Kelly (The Comey rule).</desc>

    <desc lang="fr">Animée par une petite bande de chroniqueurs passionnés, cette émission mensuelle consacrée exclusivement aux séries passe en revue les sorties et les tournages qui font l'actualité des séries à succès et celles qui méritent d'être découvertes. Pourquoi certaines fictions accrochent et touchent plus que d'autres ? Les images seront analysés afin d'apporter un point de vue technique. Autour des séries évènements, des découvertes et des pépites, les débats sont garantis sans spoilers.</desc>

Mussolini banned it in Italy, and Hitler's Ministry of Propaganda banned it in Nazi Germany. The film vanished during WWII, and was thought to have been destroyed. Then it was recovered in 1946, but in an altered state. Decades would then pass before the original negative could be confirmed.\n\nThe Nazis hated the film because of its pacifist, anti-war, theme. The setting for the film is Germany in 1914, during WWI. Germans capture several French officers and take them to a POW camp, specifically for officers. After several escape attempts, the French officers get shuffled off to a presumably escape proof castle, run by Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim), a flamboyant German officer with a forbidding persona.\n\nUnlike other war movies, "La Grande Illusion" shows no actual combat, and the number of deaths is minimal. The film's tone is surprisingly lighthearted. Writer/Director Renoir conveys a sense of community among the French prisoners, despite their differences in social class. We see them several times sitting around a table eating, and chatting amiably. The cordiality between prisoners and their jailers is also surprising. It's not exactly a hug fest, but the predominant feeling among the men is respect for fellow officers, even if those officers are your enemy. None of the French or German officers want war; it's just their "duty", when called on.\n\nIn most of the film, scenes take place in small rooms or in that castle. Toward the film's end, outdoor vistas provide a visual contrast. Except at the film's end, I was amazed at how drab the surroundings are. Room furnishings are unadorned and contain the barest of essentials. Tables and floors are made of simple wood. The clothes are dreary and depressing. The stone castle is dank and forbidding. Music is made with simple instruments, like a harmonica or a flute. Of course, given the time period and considering the setting, such drabness and simplicity are not surprising. But the contrast with today's complex world of modern luxuries, that we take for granted, is striking. The film's B&amp;W cinematography accentuates the drab environment.\n\nThe story can be a bit confusing in the first half, because the relationship between the jailers and the prisoners is so unusual. Viewers need to give the film wide latitude on this. Watching the film a second time helps clarify who is doing what to whom. The plot is easier to follow in the second half.\n\nThe film's acting is credible. I especially liked the performance of von Stroheim, all decked out in that imposing uniform, that monocle, and with that stiff bearing.\n\n"La Grande Illusion" is an unusual "war" film, one that had real significance during WWII. For this reason alone, it deserves to be seen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1937-10-04","keywords":"military,french soldier,upper class,prisoner of war camp,christmas","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grand Illusion: 75th Anniversary","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1344124953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQxZTlhOGQtMmNlYy00Y2IyLWI3YmUtMjZjMTQ3MDJhNWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQxZTlhOGQtMmNlYy00Y2IyLWI3YmUtMjZjMTQ3MDJhNWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Grand Illusion"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0300064/","name":"Jean Gabin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0663077/","name":"Dita Parlo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0294382/","name":"Pierre Fresnay"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0719756/","name":"Jean Renoir"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053790/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0816458/","name":"Charles Spaak"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0719756/","name":"Jean Renoir"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="fr">Le silence de la mer: Directed by Jean-Pierre Melville. With Howard Vernon, Nicole Stéphane, Jean-Marie Robain, Ami Aaröe. 1941 in a small town in Nazi occupied France. Against the will of its elderly male and his adult niece residents, the Nazis commandeer a house for one of their officers, Lt. Werner von Ebrennac, to live in for as long as he is in the area on Nazi business. As a figurative and literal silent protest against the Nazis and the officer, the uncle and niece do whatever is required of them while the officer is in their house, however they do not acknowledge his presence, living largely in silence whenever he is around. The officer treats the housing situation with care, like he is a guest. Although not a nightly occurrence, the officer begins an evening routine with his reluctant hosts: in his civilian clothes, he knocks on the door of the room in which they have convened for the evening, walking in shortly thereafter knowing that no acknowledgment will be made for him to enter, he visits with them for no more than five minutes before he bids them a good evening as he exits. During these visits, he speaks reverently about, among other things, culture - music and literature in particular as he is a composer and musician - his national pride, his love of France, and what he hopes will emerge from the war, namely a strong and free France, stronger than it was before the war, and the marriage between the French and German cultures which will enrich the lives of all Europeans. All the while, he makes no expectations from them, either to listen, or to answer if they are indeed listening. At the end of what ends up being his six month stay at the house, he does end up having a profound effect on the uncle and niece, despite that effect being largely unacknowledged, as his stay in France has a profound effect on him, opening up his eyes to the reality of the war based largely on his first ever visit into Paris." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0039822/","name":"Le silence de la mer","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJjM2ZkZTEtZDM0My00YzU2LWEzNTMtMWExNDY3OWNmYjlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"1941 in a small town in Nazi occupied France.

I think it is one of the best movies made in Europe in the first years after the WW2. It is quiet and simple, but very powerful at the same time. Without any killing or death in it, this film shows the absurdness and tragedy of war better than any other I have seen. At the same time, for me this was a very good insight in the spirit of French resistance. But above all, it is about a collapse of dreams, a conflict between one's conscience and ideology, and a realisation of how senseless human feelings, aspirations and the whole existence is made by the war.

Although not a nightly occurrence, the officer begins an evening routine with his reluctant hosts: in his civilian clothes, he knocks on the door of the room in which they have convened for the evening, walking in shortly thereafter knowing that no acknowledgment will be made for him to enter, he visits with them for no more than five minutes before he bids them a good evening as he exits. During these visits, he speaks reverently about, among other things, culture - music and literature in particular as he is a composer and musician - his national pride, his love of France, and what he hopes will emerge from the war, namely a strong and free France, stronger than it was before the war, and the marriage between the French and German cultures which will enrich the lives of all Europeans. All the while, he makes no expectations from them, either to listen, or to answer if they are indeed listening. At the end of what ends up being his six month stay at the house, he does end up having a profound effect on the uncle and niece, despite that effect being largely unacknowledged, as his stay in France has a profound effect on him, opening up his eyes to the reality of the war based largely on his first ever visit into Paris." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0039822/","name":"Le silence de la mer","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJjM2ZkZTEtZDM0My00YzU2LWEzNTMtMWExNDY3OWNmYjlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"1941 in a small town in Nazi occupied France.

I think it is one of the best movies made in Europe in the first years after the WW2. It is quiet and simple, but very powerful at the same time. Without any killing or death in it, this film shows the absurdness and tragedy of war better than any other I have seen. At the same time, for me this was a very good insight in the spirit of French resistance. But above all, it is about a collapse of dreams, a conflict between one's conscience and ideology, and a realisation of how senseless human feelings, aspirations and the whole existence is made by the war. Very deep and impressive. I felt like crying at the end.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4704,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"1949-04-22","keywords":"reference to rene descartes,notre dame cathedral,organ,occupied france,german in france","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0894677/","name":"Howard Vernon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0836677/","name":"Nicole Stéphane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0730153/","name":"Jean-Marie Robain"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578483/","name":"Jean-Pierre Melville"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020223/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0893736/","name":"Vercors","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578483/","name":"Jean-Pierre Melville"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Two things stand out : First the very positive display of the Captain of the Graf Spee, Langsdorff, treating his prisoners positively and trying to kill ships but not humans and even saving his crew from heroic death in Battle by sinking the ship by himself and refusing to go into battle. And his tragic end by suicide. Second, the laconic display of the British Officers and Men in Battle. This is where my title quote is coming from, as a message issued by the Captain of the shut-down and burning Exeter trying to escape to safety after the Battle and heavy hits. Otherwise it seems to be a rather careful display of events, although the scenes in Montevideo are sometimes play out like a prelude to a Carry On Farce. Greatest weakness is, that we totally loose sight of the German views and events on board Graf Spee once the battle has started.

Two things stand out : First the very positive display of the Captain of the Graf Spee, Langsdorff, treating his prisoners positively and trying to kill ships but not humans and even saving his crew from heroic death in Battle by sinking the ship by himself and refusing to go into battle. And his tragic end by suicide. Second, the laconic display of the British Officers and Men in Battle. This is where my title quote is coming from, as a message issued by the Captain of the shut-down and burning Exeter trying to escape to safety after the Battle and heavy hits. Otherwise it seems to be a rather careful display of events, although the scenes in Montevideo are sometimes play out like a prelude to a Carry On Farce. Greatest weakness is, that we totally loose sight of the German views and events on board Graf Spee once the battle has started.

The killer killed 12 of them..\n\nThis is not a serial killer who comes out of the blue.Tavernier takes time to describe his mind :he was bitten by a rabid dog (or more like as one scene in a church tells us ,he was raped by a priest),he served in the army but was discharged,and mainly the girl he loved did not want him anymore.He tried to kill her and to take his own life but he failed twice,and in the asylum,they wrecked his brain.Although he is a killer,he is actually a political prisoner:he realized that as far his crimes were concerned ,the blame had to be put on a criminal society:in a remarkable scene ,the judge's mother reads the reports concerning the awful crimes as if she 's reading the tittle-tattle of the town.The serial killer identifies himself with Jesus and Joan of Arc ...\n\nIn direct contrast to hîm,we have the judge :admirably portrayed by Tavernier's favourite actor ,Philippe Noiret,he epitomizes the bourgeoisie,the man who wants to keep the world as it is;this is a very complex opaque character:nearing 50,he stills lives with his mother,and he's got nasty habits (see the scene when he buggers Isabelle Huppert).\n\nThere are a lot of things to say about "le juge et l'assassin":the film successfully recreates the atmosphere of the period,not only by its hints at Dreyfus,at a country which is bent on revenge ,at a Church which feels its power slip away (the priest thundering against "school without God" ,about 10 years after Jules Ferry instituted secular education,and about 10 years before the separation of the Church and the State in France).But it even recreates it with its original songs ,which is quite a feat.We really feel we are in the time machine,and that's the main reason why Tavernier's movie is so precious:no one can find echoes of the seventies in France,which would have dated and marred the film.Even if the socialists appear at the end of the movie,there's no connection with their impending coming in the eighties.\n\nA masterpiece ,Tavernier's best film along with "la vie et rien d'autre".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1982,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"genre":["Crime","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1976-03-10","keywords":"reference to the virgin mary,confession of crime,murder confession,reference to robespierre,reference to emile zola","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1353302041","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkZTUzMWItY2NmZi00YWFhLTllZTMtZmQzNmFjNmFkY2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkZTUzMWItY2NmZi00YWFhLTllZTMtZmQzNmFjNmFkY2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634159/","name":"Philippe Noiret"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0301556/","name":"Michel Galabru"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851724/","name":"Bertrand Tavernier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012275/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029701/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079070/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0042179/","name":"Jean Aurenche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851724/","name":"Bertrand Tavernier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0098204/","name":"Pierre Bost"}],"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The killer killed 12 of them..\n\nThis is not a serial killer who comes out of the blue.Tavernier takes time to describe his mind :he was bitten by a rabid dog (or more like as one scene in a church tells us ,he was raped by a priest),he served in the army but was discharged,and mainly the girl he loved did not want him anymore.He tried to kill her and to take his own life but he failed twice,and in the asylum,they wrecked his brain.Although he is a killer,he is actually a political prisoner:he realized that as far his crimes were concerned ,the blame had to be put on a criminal society:in a remarkable scene ,the judge's mother reads the reports concerning the awful crimes as if she 's reading the tittle-tattle of the town.The serial killer identifies himself with Jesus and Joan of Arc ...\n\nIn direct contrast to hîm,we have the judge :admirably portrayed by Tavernier's favourite actor ,Philippe Noiret,he epitomizes the bourgeoisie,the man who wants to keep the world as it is;this is a very complex opaque character:nearing 50,he stills lives with his mother,and he's got nasty habits (see the scene when he buggers Isabelle Huppert).\n\nThere are a lot of things to say about "le juge et l'assassin":the film successfully recreates the atmosphere of the period,not only by its hints at Dreyfus,at a country which is bent on revenge ,at a Church which feels its power slip away (the priest thundering against "school without God" ,about 10 years after Jules Ferry instituted secular education,and about 10 years before the separation of the Church and the State in France).But it even recreates it with its original songs ,which is quite a feat.We really feel we are in the time machine,and that's the main reason why Tavernier's movie is so precious:no one can find echoes of the seventies in France,which would have dated and marred the film.Even if the socialists appear at the end of the movie,there's no connection with their impending coming in the eighties.\n\nA masterpiece ,Tavernier's best film along with "la vie et rien d'autre".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1982,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Crime","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1976-03-10","keywords":"reference to the virgin mary,confession of crime,murder confession,reference to robespierre,reference to emile zola","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1353302041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkZTUzMWItY2NmZi00YWFhLTllZTMtZmQzNmFjNmFkY2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGRkZTUzMWItY2NmZi00YWFhLTllZTMtZmQzNmFjNmFkY2M5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634159/","name":"Philippe Noiret","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0301556/","name":"Michel Galabru","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851724/","name":"Bertrand Tavernier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012275/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029701/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079070/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0042179/","name":"Jean Aurenche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851724/","name":"Bertrand Tavernier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0098204/","name":"Pierre Bost"],"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="fr">Différente des divas qui l'ont précédée, l'Italienne Anna Magnani, actrice sensuelle au regard magnétique, a offert un nouveau visage au cinéma : celui d'une femme libre, impressionnante de gravité et d'aplomb. Ce documentaire retrace la vie et la carrière riche en coups d'éclats et en traversées du désert d'une actrice douée, excessive et volcanique, à travers les souvenirs de son fils Luca et des cinéastes qui l'ont dirigée. Visconti, Fellini et Renoir racontent, notamment, le bouillonnant talent créatif dont elle nourrissait ses interprétations.</desc>

Without any money, they seek a job position for saxophone and bass players in another band and they are invited to play in a concert for one night only in a distant town. Joe borrows the car of a former girlfriend to travel and when they arrive in the parking garage, they witness the "Saint Valentine's Day Massacre" led by the infamous mobster Spats Columbo (George Raft). The criminals discover Joe and Jerry hidden in a corner and when the killers are ready to execute them, they succeed to escape. Joe and Jerry disguise, dressing like women and they head to Florida by train with an all-girl band using the names of Josephine and Daphne. They get close to singer Sugar Kane Kowalczyk (Marilyn Monroe) and Joe falls in love with her but she believes he is a woman. Meanwhile the millionaire Osgood Fielding III (Joe E. Brown) harasses Daphne inviting her to visit his yacht. When Spats and his henchmen arrive in the same hotel where Joe and Jerry are lodged for a mafia convention, the two musicians feel that they are in a dangerous situation.\n\nYesterday Tony Curtis died and I decided to watch "Some Like it Hot" again. This film is another masterpiece of Billy Wilder and certainly one of the best comedies of the cinema history. Jack Lemmon is hilarious and responsible for some of the funniest moments especially when Osgood flirts with Daphne. Marilyn Monroe performs the perfect dumb blonde stereotype. Last time I had seen this movie was on 18 August 2000.

    <desc lang="fr">Les galettes de Pont-Aven: Directed by Joël Séria. With Jean-Pierre Marielle, Dolores McDonough, Jeanne Goupil, Claude Piéplu. Henri is a middle-aged travelling umbrella salesman from Saumur who lives a sexless and unhappy married life with his puritan wife and two children. Painting is the only true passion of Henri but he also has an affection for female buttocks. One night, on the roads of Brittany he hits a boar with his car. Émile, a rude and carefree painter who lives in a cottage near Riec-sur-Belon meets him and invites him to stay at his house while the car is being fixed. Henri falls in love with his Canadian live-in girlfriend Angela who draws Henri's attention with her beautiful buttocks. They leave Émile after a violent confrontation and move to Pont-Aven, 'the city of painters'. Angela encourages Henri to continue his life as a painter and he sees this as an opportunity to leave his earlier life behind. However, Angela soon dumps him for Émile and Henri becomes a drunkard, butt of jokes in the town, and a painter unable to sell a single painting. Marie, the teenage maid working at the pension Henri stays, is apparently in love with him but he seems to neglect her because his mind is too occupied with Angela. However, Henri soon faces his true feelings for Marie.

In the 1800s, two elderly maiden ladies (Birgitte Federspiel and Bodil Kjer) reside in remote Jutland, where they have sacrificed their lives, romantic possibilities, and personal happiness in order to continue their long-dead father's religious ministry to the small flock he served. One of the women's youthful admirers sends to them a Frenchwoman, Babette (Stéphane Audran), whose husband and son have been killed in France and who has fled her homeland lest she meet the same fate. Although they do not really require her services, the sisters engage her as maid and cook--and as the years pass her cleverness and tireless efforts on their behalf enables the aging congregation to remain together and the sisters to live in more comfort than they had imagined; indeed, the entire village admires and depends upon her.\n\nOne day, however, Babette receives a letter: she has won a lottery and is now, by village standards, a wealthy woman. Knowing that her new wealth will mean her return to France, the sisters grant her wish that she be allowed to prepare a truly French meal for them and the members of their tiny congregation. The meal and the evening it is served is indeed a night to remember--but not for reasons that might be expected, for Babette's feast proves to be food for both body and soul, and is ultimately her gift of love to the women who took her in and the villagers who have been so kind to her.\n\nThe film is extraordinary in every way, meticulous in detail yet not overpowering in its presentation of them. As the film progresses, we come to love the characters in both their simple devotion to God and their all-too-human frailties, and the scenes in which Babette prepares her feast and in which the meal is consumed are powerful, beautiful, and incredibly memorable. There have been several films that have used food as a metaphor for love, but none approach the simple artistry and beauty of BABETTE'S FEAST, which reminds us of all the good things about humanity and which proves food for both body and soul. Highly, highly recommended.\n\nGary F.

The film focuses on a middle aged man named Marcel, who makes a living going around town and working as a shoe shiner. Business is not always great and at home Marcel lives a very simple life with his much adored wife, Arletty. One day a group of refugees are found in town and one of them, a young boy named, Idrissa escapes and is wanted by the local chief inspector and the police. Marcel one day stumbles across the boy and shows kindness to him and the next thing he knows, Idrissa shows up at his home. The rest of the story is about how out of his way, Marcel will go to hide and protect the boy from the police and to find a way to get him back with his family. Le Havre is a great film on several different levels. The acting here from the whole cast is all very good here and just their facial expressions and deadpan looks say a lot even when there is nothing in particular to be said. They convey the feelings and thoughts and emotions of their characters perfectly. The direction and writing of this film by Aki Kaurismaki is also a real delight here. He provides us with some very interesting characters and a good story to use and put them to work in. I also found that the film had just the right blend of humour and drama. Ultimately this is a feel good film and I think almost anybody who watches it will leave feeling very happy and joyful. The story and events in the film are simple enough and nothing is done to extravagance, but I think what really got me about the whole thing was the kindness not only Marcel, but his friends and neighbours, show to Idrissa, knowing that if they are caught, they too could be in a lot of trouble. It was really refreshing to see these characters live their simple yet happy lives and find happiness in things we take for granted and how when one needs help, they will be the first ones there to lend a hand and offer support. They work together well as a community and more than that they are great friends and neighbours who look out for each other. That was what I really thought got me about Le Havre, the basic message of the kindness of strangers and being the good Samaritan and helping out your fellow man. The film I might add is also quite a good looking film and I really admired it's cinematography. At one time it shows buildings and homes in bright primary colours and then goes to show us bleak and older homes that are a bit run down and much more simple. The colour scheme and the effect of this further added to my appreciation of the film and how these characters live. The cinematography actually reminded me of the works of French cinematographer Raoul Coutard, whose work I came to know and love in Jean-Luc Godard's films such as Contempt (which looks absolutely exquisite on it's Blu Ray release), but now back to Le Havre. This is a film where much joy and laughter can be had, but also gives us hope for each other and the human race. The film may be a little unrealistic in that regard of showing the goodness in people, but any film that has that as it's central message and gives us something to not only think about, but to feel good about after is a winner in my books. It may even get you to re-evaluate your own attitudes and perspectives on things, so keep an open mind while watching. This is one of the most entertaining and inspiring films of 2011 and also one of the best.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21113,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2011-09-08","keywords":"neighbor,container,illegal immigrant,bar,shoe shiner","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi514301465","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMzIzNzAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDU1NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMzIzNzAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDU1NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When an African boy arrives by cargo ship in the port city of Le Havre, an aging shoe shiner takes pity on the child and welcomes him into his home."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0932870/","name":"André Wilms"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3805567/","name":"Blondin Miguel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201669/","name":"Jean-Pierre Darroussin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0442454/","name":"Aki Kaurismäki"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066724/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012835/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052813/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0442454/","name":"Aki Kaurismäki"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The settings are superbly created -- the green, grotto-like woodland where Irons and Streep meet in the Victorian world of the film, the murky streets of Lyme, Exeter, and London, and the interior of the lawyer's office, for example. The Victorian part of the film emerges from the dawning of the concept of abnormal psychology (just before Freud) and is really convincing. Streep shows us that her character cannot move on emotionally until she has worked out her own madness. That constitutes a remarkable and complex performance of insanity and self-awareness inhabiting a single psyche. She earns the gentle movement out of the tunnel and onto the calm lake. The turbulence of the unconscious -- that threatening sea of which Irons has warned her -- has been subdued. Seems to me the flaw lies in the 'modern story' (as some here have pointed out). It may be that the Streep character is trying to find a subtext for her fictional heroine, but it looks like the old ennui, so that, while her lack of concern for the relationship is understandable, his obsession with it is not. Though the garden party at the end almost gets it there. Were we shown her decision there? If so, I missed it.

The settings are superbly created -- the green, grotto-like woodland where Irons and Streep meet in the Victorian world of the film, the murky streets of Lyme, Exeter, and London, and the interior of the lawyer's office, for example. The Victorian part of the film emerges from the dawning of the concept of abnormal psychology (just before Freud) and is really convincing. Streep shows us that her character cannot move on emotionally until she has worked out her own madness. That constitutes a remarkable and complex performance of insanity and self-awareness inhabiting a single psyche. She earns the gentle movement out of the tunnel and onto the calm lake. The turbulence of the unconscious -- that threatening sea of which Irons has warned her -- has been subdued. Seems to me the flaw lies in the 'modern story' (as some here have pointed out). It may be that the Streep character is trying to find a subtext for her fictional heroine, but it looks like the old ennui, so that, while her lack of concern for the relationship is understandable, his obsession with it is not. Though the garden party at the end almost gets it there. Were we shown her decision there? If so, I missed it. I like the concept of the 'two endings' and their contrast, but the ending in the 20th century was a so what? The one in the 19th century was complex and included much of the pain that the relationship had caused both characters.

Coming along at a crossroads section in French fornication film history, with simulation rapidly rendered obsolete by full color penetration, Unia felt commercially compelled to retrieve his labor of love from domestic distribution at the eleventh hour, sprucing up its mildly naughty shenanigans with pornographic pickup shots, a common practice at this stage in the evolution of European erotic cinema. A similar fate befell his follow-up feature, LE PIED! a/k/a FLAT OUT, but at least this time around several of the original cast members (including Béatrice Harnois, Frédérique Barral and Pamela Stanford) stepped up to the plate to perform the "offensive" acts themselves. Realizing there was no way back, Unia embraced his new source of employment, churning out competently crafted carnal capers, albeit at a more reverential rate than his brethren in slime.\n\nCharacterized by both ecological concerns and an oddly protofeminist sensibility, allowing amorously autonomous heroines to challenge phallocratic patriarchy, his concise body of work was initially taken at face value by otherwise knowledgeable scribes as that of a female filmmaker, the anagrammatic "Reine Pirau" ! ESTELLE ET FLORA, with its devil may care eponymous erotic explorers, could serve as a prototype of the director's idiosyncratic approach, taken to Utopian extremes with B...COMME BEATRICE's harmonious matriarchal farming community. Subverting the myth of the rape of the Sabine women, L'ENLEVEMENT DES SABINES had a group of sexually disgruntled women joining forces against male egotism. Even though there's a price to pay for their defiance, a recurring turn of events throughout Unia's explicit endeavors, his female characters have the last word, obtaining vengeance both sophisticated and unexpected for the unbridled male violence inflicted upon them, a knee-jerk reaction towards their mates' challenging an increasingly antiquated status quo.\n\nAttempting to emulate EMMANUELLE's continued box office drawing power, with video rental and cable TV a reliable secondary source of income, Unia scheduled a brief return to real name respectability with a score of four tame trifles, all of which amazingly opened alongside Hollywood blockbusters at Paris first run theaters. Nobody's fool, the director made sure to shoot simultaneous - if sometimes substantially different - hardcore versions to maximize potential profits. Last as well as least of the lot, OUTRAGE AUX MOEURS approximates a cheapskate rendition of the already sordid if marginally popular (due in no small part to their pulp print source) BRIGADE MONDAINE skin-heavy "thrillers" searching to expose such tabloid-friendly subjects as white slavery and drug trafficking.\n\nThirtysomething movie mogul Claude Farrell ("Chris Garini" a/k/a porn performer Ghislain Garet, prominently featured in Gérard Kikoïne's NEVER ENOUGH) has the hots for aspiring actress Grendy Daumier (Valérie Houlier), star of his latest not-quite-porn blockbuster DORTOIR DES GRANDES - in reality, Unia's previous simulated opus COLLEGE DORMITORY - and at least a decade his junior. Unaware she's using him to further her career, with frequent trips to the tropical isle of St. Barts a pleasant bonus (not least in terms of production value), Claude receives the proverbial wake up call coming back from business earlier than expected to find Grendy giving it up to a lowly delivery guy. Shooting his rival for the unworthy tramp's affections, he goes on the lam, seeking refuge on a houseboat inhabited by another pair of cinema hopefuls, down to earth Chantal (Laetitia Thomas) and round-heeled Carla ("Ghislaine Kerdavid" a/k/a Michelle Davy, star of Michel Lemoine's LOVE IN PARADISE) who respond to Claude's disruptive presence in radically different ways. While Chantal seizes each opportunity to alert outsiders for help, Carla just comes on to him ! \n\nWhat little plot there is plays better as (albeit unintentional) comedy with wholly implausible situations - like Claude accompanying Chantal on a porn dubbing session since they both could do with the cash ?! - and some of the most wooden acting ever inflicted upon a paying audience. Ironically the sole cast member foregoing fornication film experience, totally talent-barren Houlier proves the prime offender with the fake tan sporting Garet a close contender. Frizzy-haired Thomas, who starred in Unia's simultaneously shot FESSES VIERGES A L'ESSAI AUX CARAIBES only to disappear without a trace, tries hard but is forced to face defeat by a belated change of heart turning her character into a complete moron. Ultimately, the delightful Davy comes off best, perpetually naked and wisely entrusted with most of the sex scenes. Stateside audiences may recall she starred (as "Nicole Vartan") in Jourdan Alexander's passable sequel TAXI GIRLS 2. Truncated orgy footage - check out FESSES VIERGES for the "inside scoop" ! - showcases a plethora of recognizable porn performers like mustachioed Jacky Arnal, incredible hunk Eric Saville, chunky Frank Balard, Karoline Houtart (the chubby-cheeked chick in a nun's habit also appearing in Michel Barny's AMOUR, FANTASMES ET FANTAISIE) plus a veritable who's who of Michel Lemoine cast-offs including Amanda Shell (FORBIDDEN PLEASURES), Chantal Trobert (MARILYN MON AMOUR) and Mina Houghe (HOT DESIRES).

Color, focus, angle, and a myriad of other elements also make this film stimulating visually.

The plot moves snappily for the first half of the film, but almost every twist is predictable, and the pace begins to drag, hiccuping along into the second half.

To make matters worse, I was very unsatisfied by the climax and resolution.  To what degree Koepp deserves the blame for these mismatched, unpleasant elements I do not know, but in my opinion he hasn't written a great script since Jurassic Park, which had all the comedy of Panic Room, but must have stolen the suspense from the second half.\n\nOverall, I'd give this movie 2 out of 5.

Dont think for a second you will get to see Charlize Theron in any kind of hot or glamorous scenes. She plays a character that is dead inside. Mentally scarred for life. But she is unaware of it. She is about to find out though when she revisits her old highschool friends.\n\nSome movies are simply a kick in my gut. This is one of those. I would not recommend it to any of my friends who want to be entertained.

Gorgeous visuals worth the price of admission","reviewBody":"I'm a sucker for period pieces and this one delivered on all the parts that I love. Great costumes and art direction. Breathtaking scenery complete with castles set among hills ablaze in autumn colors. And oh, the fabrics!!! French is always beautiful to listen to, but this film was simply music to the ears. Gorgeous use of language. Thundering horses, clashing swords, unrequited love. Shamelessly romantic while showing how tough life was. War was miserable. No escape from the rain and cold.

He sang well and I always want to see whether he acted well.\n\nJust my luck that DVD of this title was and is still not easily available in town. Why? It is not a movie for green whippersnappers or precocious imps but the well-aged wise. It was filmed some twenty years ago and I then exactly lacked twenty years' maturity. My big thank you to the 27th French Cinepanorama held in this month, after having gained twenty more years experience in life, now I know how to enjoy this movie. If I saw the movie right after it was freshly produced in 1983, I am very sure I would not understand the main plot or subplot, the observant director Claude Sautet, not to mention his ideas. After all, Yves Montand is now lying six feet under inside the cemetery Père-Lachaise in Paris and Jacques Villeret (Gilbert)'s head has gone half-bald in the French box-office hit "Le Dîner de cons" where he plays the tricked "François Pignon".\n\nThe restaurant setting reminds me the frantic and noisy kitchen in "Dinner Rush": shouting chef, cooking heat, fire and smell, the orderly mess, clicking sound of cutlery and crockery, conflict between waiters and chef.\n\nThere are usually many subplots in Sautet's works because he was able to capture human sentiments, especially those of ordinary people leading ordinary life, well in details and display it with an undertone of melancholy humour, even for serious subjects like human alienation, one of the ideas showcased in Garçon!.\n\nResourceful Alex was once a tap dancer, though not very accomplished, he seems to be respected in the dancing room. With limited funds and resources, this maturing restaurant waiter aspires to start an amusement park on the beach and he makes it! "Jerry Maguire" is the American version of Alex. Both men are capable of winning the heart of many. Every one around them likes them. They go around women one after one pretty successfully, it's nothing novel to see that they have two or three at one time. For instance, Alex has frequent trysts with rich poodle Gloria, from whom he tactfully draws out a free-interest loan of FFr100,000. Besides, he is concurrently after Claire, an English language instructor whom he knew seventeen years ago at her father's wedding on a boat. On top of these two relationships, he keeps a punctuated contact with the down-and-out Coline.\n\nOn the surface, both Jerry and Alex are candies to all. Cruelly and honestly, it is Gilbert, Alex's room-mate and colleague, who is sharp at pointing out their common blind spot: they are not related to anybody, both American Jerry and French Alex only think about themselves. What different is, Jerry's ending gives us hope while the final rainy scene of Alex at his well-received amusement park tells us what reality tends to be like: remaining alone.\n\nWhen Alex is successful with his career, his dream park, all his women left: both Gloria and Claire return to their husbands, Coline follows a younger waiter of the restaurant.

    <desc lang="fr">Bright Star: Directed by Jane Campion. With Abbie Cornish, Ben Whishaw, Paul Schneider, Kerry Fox.

It seemed to me anything but that. This is a movie about the rhythms of poetic image from romantic love, translated to cinematic image. The poet is Keats, who likely was as imagined: melancholy, reaching for a romantic purity. Many such existed it seems, but few that achieved this in words that matter.\n\nThe story is a simple one: ordinary in many ways. Instead of romanticizing the woman, and their love, Campion does us a real service. She shows that this great love was largely a matter of accident: two primed lonely souls finding each other. The woman in this case really was not very special, except in finding deep love. The contrast between the souls of the poems, and similar pure romantic love of movies and what we have here is striking.\n\nThe shift is not from the poetry to the people. The people stay real. It is from the poetry to the cinematic presentation. Campion is able without being obvious, of slipping real romantic images to buoy this. Usually we have conventional duft, presenting some unrealistic ideal. Here we have true love in sight, surrounding ordinariness.\n\nOur bright star is a seamstress obsessed with fashion — fashion that makes her truly seem shallow. Many of the clothes she wears are strikingly ugly in the overall assembly. But in the small — which we often see — they are composed of elements that could be items of extended meditation. That they are her extended skin, consciously designed and carefully crafted makes her an extraordinarily appealing lover.\n\nThe first seconds of this film set the world, one that is extraordinary. We see a closeup of a tiny needle being perfectly threaded. We see an enormous closeup of that needle piercing virginal white fabric. We slowly work to the situation of the woman involved. She is the narrator, the maker. This is a movie that goes in my database of "cloth" films, because the use of cloth is basic.\n\nThere is short preliminary, a short courting. It is not from Austin, where strong soulmates bond, just two ordinary souls. But when they kiss, we have one of the two sublime scenes. She lays on her bed (the location of which carries great significance). A white curtain blows seductively over her. Her similar white dress has the wind lifting it and awakening underneath. This is absolutely breathtaking.\n\nA second sequence may seem too heavy for most. Her love goes away and she is forlorn. He writes an amazing letter, thus beginning his great period. Butterflies are mentioned. So she fills her room with butterflies. These somehow actually perform as part of the fabric-ed space, participating as if directed. Oh no! She gets a letter cutting off futures, and the butterflies die, to be swept into bins. If ever there was a romantic cinematic environment, this is it, the butter-feathered bedroom, where words feed image.\n\nThe little sister, perhaps ten and named Toots, is patterned after Tootie in "Meet Me in St Louis," redhead, precocious, and romanticized beyond all else. She is a sort of emissary into innocence, anchoring the ideals this elicits but does not exploit. Ms Campion, thank you. A movie about love that makes love. Thank you.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25929,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-11-06","keywords":"reed,artistic creation,period drama,poet,passion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bright Star","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3821732377","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwOTExMDUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjczOTM3Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMwOTExMDUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjczOTM3Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A drama based on the three-year romance between 19th century poet John Keats and Fanny Brawne, which was cut short by Keats' untimely death at age 25."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180411/","name":"Abbie Cornish"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0924210/","name":"Ben Whishaw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0773973/","name":"Paul Schneider"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001005/","name":"Jane Campion"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086691/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001005/","name":"Jane Campion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1652346/","name":"Andrew Motion"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I was the only bloke on my own.\n\nNow, many enjoy a romantic film; generally, I don't. Audrey Tautou was definitely the selling point for me. I'm sure a good number will find Delicacy a delightful film, full of life's quirks and nicely Gallic, too.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the scenes are in and around the workplace, the direction is boring and the camera-work often rather lazy. And, the film is getting on for being seriously long - 108mins for a rom-com is pushing it a bit.\n\nThankfully, the characters are rather more interesting with our lovely Tautou generally rather underplaying her lead role and came across as being slightly disinterested, though this may have been intentional. There are a couple of scenes that she acts masterfully, though and these help keep us interested.\n\nThe scenario goes something like this - Nathalie (Tautau) is distraught when her perfect life partner tragically dies. To distract her grief she throws herself into her work as a middle-manager (a law firm, I think), but still she dwells on her loss. One day, she literally throws herself at balding and rather gangly Swede Markus (Francois Damiens) who understandably, cannot believe his luck. She initially denies that she had any reason do have done that but tentatively, they become closer. Getting others - her friends, parents and workmates to take Markus seriously then becomes the thrust of the film.\n\nIt's quietly affecting and amusing, certainly not laugh-out-loud and will be too subtle and slightly off-key for those who only really go for blatant and brash U.S rom-coms. Better seen (I'm sure) as a couple and even more so if that couple are 'together' Delicacy offers some quirky embellishments to add a touch of magic as well as a story that is slightly different.

La stratégie de la poussette is the blandest and most predictable of rom-coms, one that could have been made in the 80's as easily as in 2012, and every joke is a painful cliché, even if Raphaël Personnaz is charismatic enough to make a couple of them work. There's some inspiration in the first and last scenes, but everything in-between would have felt right at home in an episode of Baby Daddy or in Three Men and a Baby (whether it's the French or American version).

Which begs the question, why?\n\nTruly what is the point? It's even in the same language as the original so there is no accessibility issue for people who don't like subtitles.\n\nOnce again it tells the story of a man approached by a lawyer and notified that he has over 500 children via sperm donations he made 20yrs prior. A percentage of the kids want to know who he is and a court case will take place.\n\nTruth be told it's a wonderful story, the original was excellent and even the US version was highly enjoyable but what's with all the senseless remakes?\n\nFonzy is a competently made version, it just shouldn't have been made.\n\nWant to see this wonderful story?

Which begs the question, why?\n\nTruly what is the point? It's even in the same language as the original so there is no accessibility issue for people who don't like subtitles.\n\nOnce again it tells the story of a man approached by a lawyer and notified that he has over 500 children via sperm donations he made 20yrs prior. A percentage of the kids want to know who he is and a court case will take place.\n\nTruth be told it's a wonderful story, the original was excellent and even the US version was highly enjoyable but what's with all the senseless remakes?\n\nFonzy is a competently made version, it just shouldn't have been made.\n\nWant to see this wonderful story? Watch Starbuck (2011) instead.\n\nThe Good:\n\nThe same sweet, heartfelt story\n\nLead was competent\n\nThe Bad:\n\nSimply shouldn't exist\n\nThings I Learnt From This Movie:\n\nI'll never understand the logic of carbon copy remakes","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":573,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-10-30","keywords":"winter,snow,male masturbation,sperm donor,playboy magazine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1172356121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGYxMDc5M2YtZDcxYy00NzMyLTgxZDMtYjBhODZjMDUyMjg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGYxMDc5M2YtZDcxYy00NzMyLTgxZDMtYjBhODZjMDUyMjg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305296/","name":"José Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1109153/","name":"Audrey Fleurot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0419894/","name":"Lucien Jean-Baptiste"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0227570/","name":"Isabelle Doval"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190089/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0227570/","name":"Isabelle Doval","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305296/","name":"José Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0677587/","name":"Martin Petit"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There isn't even an innuendo to keep the adults entertained. \n\nThis film is a good way to keep the kids occupied for 90mins, but nothing that adults will obtain any pleasure from (unless you are in awe of the animation which I doubt you will be).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-30","keywords":"parrot,storm,goat,robinson crusoe character,computer animation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1531492121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODA2MjkyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE4ODQ3OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODA2MjkyNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE4ODQ3OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"On a tiny exotic island, an outgoing parrot and his quirky animal companions befriend a marooned Robinson Crusoe.  When their harmonious lives are disrupted by two savage cats, they discover the true power of friendship against all odds.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0777788/","name":"Matthias Schweighöfer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0945883/","name":"Kaya Yanar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2558242/","name":"Ilka Bessin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1062463/","name":"Vincent Kesteloot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823721/","name":"Ben Stassen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562775/","name":"Mimi Maynard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046206/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063902/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214518/","name":"Daniel Defoe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0661549/","name":"Domonic Paris"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The basketball player "big brother" Morris Chestnut worked well as a trouble gifted basketball player who reluctantly takes Bow Wow under his wings and albeit predictable softens up in his parental role with the youngster.  The scene where they paint geometry lessons on the side of his mansion was hilarious and keep up the importance of school!  Kids do the darnest things and I can see a youngster after a pair of magical shoes clinging to a tree in a thunderstorm.  Okay, as a parent thats dangerous and would not want to see my youngster dangling from this tree BUT I do remember my own exploits as a child doing much of the same type of daring challenges.  Kids will be kids so this gives excellent opportunity for the parent to talk with their child about keeping it safe!  The NBA should be elated to have been giving a more good-guy image then their typical bad boy look.  Very satisfied with this film portraying a positive image for my children to watch.

The basketball player "big brother" Morris Chestnut worked well as a trouble gifted basketball player who reluctantly takes Bow Wow under his wings and albeit predictable softens up in his parental role with the youngster.  The scene where they paint geometry lessons on the side of his mansion was hilarious and keep up the importance of school!  Kids do the darnest things and I can see a youngster after a pair of magical shoes clinging to a tree in a thunderstorm.  Okay, as a parent thats dangerous and would not want to see my youngster dangling from this tree BUT I do remember my own exploits as a child doing much of the same type of daring challenges.  Kids will be kids so this gives excellent opportunity for the parent to talk with their child about keeping it safe!  The NBA should be elated to have been giving a more good-guy image then their typical bad boy look.  Very satisfied with this film portraying a positive image for my children to watch. Go Ohio!  :)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19941,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-07-03","keywords":"shoe,orphanage,basketball,orphan,reference to michael jordan","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Like Mike","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2425749785","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDczNzExYTUtZDVhNC00ZWMyLTljNzUtMGNjMDE5MTE5MTQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDczNzExYTUtZDVhNC00ZWMyLTljNzUtMGNjMDE5MTE5MTQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510168/","name":"Shad Moss","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005151/","name":"Jonathan Lipnicki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004820/","name":"Morris Chestnut"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776271/","name":"John Schultz"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039844/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0018803/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254288/","name":"Michael Elliot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0595623/","name":"Jordan Moffet"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Adam McKay's "Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy" is no exception. Seems that my taste for high concept cinema has been influenced by the summer-- well not really. This movie written by McKay and it's star Will Ferrell is an outrageous and completely over the top comedy. Applaud Will Ferrell as the mind bendingly stupid and self absorbed, San Diego newscaster, Ron Burgundy. Will Ferrell is genius in playing Ron straight without character dispersions. Ferrell creates a great deadpan sense with his cohabiting dog, Baxter, and the fact that his character Ron Burgundy will read ANYTHING on the teleprompter, his tragic flaw, well at least one of several, is priceless. Ferrell also never crosses the line of being a complete jerk which is an amazing accomplishment. In fact, Ferrell gives Ron a muted charm-- he really does grow on you. \n\nBasically, "Anchorman" is an extended sitcom. Ron is informed by his station manager, Ed (a funny Fred Willard), that he will have a co-anchor, Veronica Corningstone (a hot Christina Applegate). Turns out that Veronica was a woman whom was immune to Ron's vast charm at a wild news crew party. Veronica is beautiful, ambitious, and smart. She too has aspirations of being a Network Anchor. The Boys Club news crew which include sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), feature story guy Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), and the dumb as a post weatherman Brick Tamland (Steven Carell) all make their play for Veronica. However, she falls for Ron in spite of himself. Ron eventually woos her affections in a totally wacky jazz flute display. The screen writing is so skewed in a good way, and it has absolutely no shame. There is a classic scene with Ron's dog Baxter, and a bridge that according to my bud, John, shatters a fundamental script writing rule. In another memorable scene Ron gives an erroneous translation of the name San Diego to Veronica that is hilarious. "Anchorman" also benefits from cameos of talented actors, most notably Vince Vaughn as Wes Mantooth, the rival station anchor. Christina Applegate looks great, and truly has a talent for comedy. \n\n"Anchorman" is completely over the top, and ignores any boundaries. That really makes it work. "Anchorman" is broad stroke farce done well. Will Ferrell demonstrates great comedic gifts. I want to see what he creates next. For now, "Anchorman" is just great fun, and very funny stuff.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":339673,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2004-07-09","keywords":"tv station,erection visible through clothing,anchorman,news anchor,1970s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1149285913","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNTg5MjkwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjcyNDkxMDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNTg5MjkwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjcyNDkxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002071/","name":"Will Ferrell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000775/","name":"Christina Applegate"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0570912/","name":"Adam McKay"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158547/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002071/","name":"Will Ferrell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0570912/","name":"Adam McKay"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One can let children watch this in the same manner our grandparents were reading the original stories. It has morals, it is pretty, actors play well and, most of all, it is not condescendingly stupid. Instead, one can actually enjoy this on almost all levels.\n\nIt was funny to see actors Ewan McGregor and Ewen Bremner play in a film together again (Rents and Spud), but they had no real interaction. Nicholas Hoult was OK as the hero of the story and Stanley Tucci, as usual, a great villain. The one that was rather disappointing was the princess, clearly a role that was not really thought out much more than "cute damsel in distress, ready for the rescue". Her father wasn't much either, but at least he had lines. Also, for a movie "made in USA" a great many English actors. Even the story was set in England, as we see in the end.\n\nBottom line: while not the best movie ever, it was certainly an entertaining blockbuster that retained a lot of the feel and plot of the original fairy tale. It also manages to have an insane body count without actually showing any blood. The US rating system is idiotic for sure. Anyway, the movie was fun. I can recommend it for an easy watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134650,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2013-03-01","keywords":"no opening credits,pig in a blanket,fairy tale,character name as title,jack the giant killer character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Web Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi830449433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NDg1OTI1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDYyMjAxOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NDg1OTI1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDYyMjAxOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Jack the Giant Slayer, a modern day fairy tale in which the long-standing peace between men and giants is threatened, as a young farmer leads an expedition into the giants' kingdom in hopes of rescuing a kidnapped princess"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0396558/","name":"Nicholas Hoult"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001804/","name":"Stanley Tucci"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001741/","name":"Bryan Singer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501359/","name":"Darren Lemke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0836081/","name":"Dan Studney"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One can let children watch this in the same manner our grandparents were reading the original stories. It has morals, it is pretty, actors play well and, most of all, it is not condescendingly stupid. Instead, one can actually enjoy this on almost all levels.\n\nIt was funny to see actors Ewan McGregor and Ewen Bremner play in a film together again (Rents and Spud), but they had no real interaction. Nicholas Hoult was OK as the hero of the story and Stanley Tucci, as usual, a great villain. The one that was rather disappointing was the princess, clearly a role that was not really thought out much more than "cute damsel in distress, ready for the rescue". Her father wasn't much either, but at least he had lines. Also, for a movie "made in USA" a great many English actors. Even the story was set in England, as we see in the end.\n\nBottom line: while not the best movie ever, it was certainly an entertaining blockbuster that retained a lot of the feel and plot of the original fairy tale. It also manages to have an insane body count without actually showing any blood. The US rating system is idiotic for sure. Anyway, the movie was fun. I can recommend it for an easy watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134650,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2013-03-01","keywords":"no opening credits,pig in a blanket,fairy tale,character name as title,jack the giant killer character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Web Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi830449433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NDg1OTI1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDYyMjAxOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM4NDg1OTI1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDYyMjAxOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Jack the Giant Slayer, a modern day fairy tale in which the long-standing peace between men and giants is threatened, as a young farmer leads an expedition into the giants' kingdom in hopes of rescuing a kidnapped princess","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0396558/","name":"Nicholas Hoult","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001804/","name":"Stanley Tucci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001741/","name":"Bryan Singer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501359/","name":"Darren Lemke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0836081/","name":"Dan Studney"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's not supposed to be "To Kill A Mockingbird" -- it's a fun experience.\n\nStephen Sondhemim's songs are stellar: "Back in Business" is energetic, "Sooner or Later" is just right, "What Can You Lose" is haunting -- even tunes like "Live Alone and Like It" add to the story\n\nGot to love the giddily over-the-top performances of Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Glenn Headly, Charlie Korsmo, Mandy Patinkin, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, supporting villains...

A much as I might enjoy Monsters University and possibly Planes, they may very well not be my favorite animated films of the year, and they probably won't be. The Croods is already my favorite animated film of the year, and this movie, Epic, in my opinion, is also pretty good.\n\nThe main protagonist of the film is Mary Katherine, or M. K., a likable (and cute) teenage girl who, after her mother's death, goes to live with her eccentric and reclusive father. Her father believes that there is a miniature world of magical little people and creatures that live in the forest, and of course other people, including M. K., don't believe him. However, she soon magically shrunken and discovers this little world, which she must save.\n\nAnd so on. I admit, the movie is not very epic; it is a bit generic and has just about every cliché possible: good vs. evil, balance of nature, dysfunctional parent/child relationship, etc etc. The film resembles a number of other films, such as FernGully, Avatar, and Honey I Shrunk the Kids, among others. One of the main characters, the Nod, even resembles Flynn Rider from Tangled pretty strongly (but this wasn't a problem for me). However, I disagree with everyone who is calling it charmless, forgettable, too reliant on visuals, and weak in terms of character, plot, heart, etc. That's right, I actually enjoyed it.\n\nI actually thought the movie was handled fairly well and has a decent, solid, enjoyable, well- paced plot. The film started out a bit slow, but I started to get more interested as trouble started brewing in the miniature forest world and then M. K. gets shrunken; from then on the movie was much better, and I got interested and emotionally involved in the story. The film also has likable characters and relationships, and good voice performances by Amanda Seyfried, Josh Hutcherson, Colin Farrell, Beyonce Knowles, and the rest of the cast. It even had some good humorous parts, including a pair of mollusks and a three-legged dog.\n\nThe best part of the film is the animation; dazzling, lively, meticulously detailed, and it helps bring everything to life. Like Avatar, this movie has what I found to be an interesting, immersing, well-designed setting. Also, like Avatar, it has a good, strong ecological message, which I appreciate.

A much as I might enjoy Monsters University and possibly Planes, they may very well not be my favorite animated films of the year, and they probably won't be. The Croods is already my favorite animated film of the year, and this movie, Epic, in my opinion, is also pretty good.\n\nThe main protagonist of the film is Mary Katherine, or M. K., a likable (and cute) teenage girl who, after her mother's death, goes to live with her eccentric and reclusive father. Her father believes that there is a miniature world of magical little people and creatures that live in the forest, and of course other people, including M. K., don't believe him. However, she soon magically shrunken and discovers this little world, which she must save.\n\nAnd so on. I admit, the movie is not very epic; it is a bit generic and has just about every cliché possible: good vs. evil, balance of nature, dysfunctional parent/child relationship, etc etc. The film resembles a number of other films, such as FernGully, Avatar, and Honey I Shrunk the Kids, among others. One of the main characters, the Nod, even resembles Flynn Rider from Tangled pretty strongly (but this wasn't a problem for me). However, I disagree with everyone who is calling it charmless, forgettable, too reliant on visuals, and weak in terms of character, plot, heart, etc. That's right, I actually enjoyed it.\n\nI actually thought the movie was handled fairly well and has a decent, solid, enjoyable, well- paced plot. The film started out a bit slow, but I started to get more interested as trouble started brewing in the miniature forest world and then M. K. gets shrunken; from then on the movie was much better, and I got interested and emotionally involved in the story. The film also has likable characters and relationships, and good voice performances by Amanda Seyfried, Josh Hutcherson, Colin Farrell, Beyonce Knowles, and the rest of the cast. It even had some good humorous parts, including a pair of mollusks and a three-legged dog.\n\nThe best part of the film is the animation; dazzling, lively, meticulously detailed, and it helps bring everything to life. Like Avatar, this movie has what I found to be an interesting, immersing, well-designed setting. Also, like Avatar, it has a good, strong ecological message, which I appreciate. It also has heart, charm, and genuine emotion, and additional good moral messages such as friendship, love, bravery, and selflessness.\n\nBottom line: If you ask me, Epic is hardly epic, but it's good. And it was especially enjoyable for me on the big screen. Kids will certainly love it; and if you are an adult, like me, just let out your inner child and enjoy the film.\n\nFor more reviews, visit my review blog: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":102384,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2013-05-29","keywords":"miniature person,father daughter relationship,dying in arms,forest,sword and fantasy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2981733913","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxMzc2MjM3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk1ODEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxMzc2MjM3Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk1ODEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A teenager finds herself transported to a deep forest setting where a battle between the forces of good and the forces of evil is taking place.

From "Americanizing" television series for the kids from Power Rangers to Ultraman, and adapting famed characters from Japanese film, games and manga to frequent disastrous effect, it still wouldn't stop the studios from going after one property after another. This time round it's the long running Dragonball series, because the assumption is that the built-in fan base would translate to instant dollars at the box office. Not.\n\nYou have to give the filmmakers a little bit of credit though, being either foolhardy, or just plain ballsy. It's a given that they cannot condense and distill the rich content into a surprisingly less than 90 minute movie, and live in the hopes of producing a sequel, or to generate a franchise (i.e. don't leave the cinema hall when the end credits start to roll). But what they successfully do, is to super-summarize the entire mythos by throwing out everything except the main gist of the entire manga, making it extremely simplistic in poor lazy-man standards in adaptation.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the film would serve as a quick launchpad to the original manga. For those with a wee bit of knowledge of what it's about (like myself), the film just treads along the same lines and doesn't offer you new information. For the fanboys, I guess you'll only get some kicks at seeing some of your favorite characters come alive, only that they look more Caucasian, and have a head full of hair when they're not supposed to (someone forgot to insist that in the contract?) That's all you're gonna get. Period.\n\nAs far as film-making and story-telling techniques go, you can see cliché after cliché being thrown at you, with the poorly and cheaply rendered special effects offering no consolation. Justin Chatwin's Goku is your typical teenager who possesses innate potential yet to be realized, and in his frustration he gets treated by peers as a loser geek. He lives with his grandpa Gohan (Randall Duk Kim in stereotypical know-it-all like in Kung Pu Panda), and develops a crush on school hottie Chi Chi (Jamie Chung). Goku's calling in life is to prevent an apocalypse from happening with the return of chief cardboard baddie Lord Piccolo (an instant shoo-in as one of the worst cinematic villains, ever!) and his temporary sidekick Mai (Eriko Tamura) who attempt to collect 7 dragonballs to fulfill an ancient myth. And of course Goku needs a Fellowship, in the form of irritating tech-wizard Bulma (Emmy Rossum last seen in the sinker Poseidon), mercenary Yum Cha (Joon Park who probably copied Rain's uninspiring cinematic turn in Speed Racer to a T) and Chow Yun-Fat the biggest name of them all here trying his darnest best to act cute as Master Roshi, who imparts skills in double quick time to Goku.\n\nSpeaking of time, or the lack thereof, everything is compressed. From two weeks to two days and the day of the blood moon shielding the yellow sun (OK so I made that up), everything moves at so fast a pace, that all you get are cheesy lines of dialog, and an excuse to paste some action sequences together. And James Wong certainly can't direct action (despite being at the helm of Jet Li's The One, which was of course bland and bad), opting to pay homage to Zack Snyder's slow-mo technique, and midway changing the style to having the camera being too close to the action, in the dark, coupled with quick MTV cuts that you don't get to see a thing.\n\nAnd the rush job just doesn't stop at the narrative or the action. Special effects wise, they look really cheap, and I wonder whether Producer Stephen Chow would roll his eyes at what would be extremely pale when put side by side with his Kung Fu Hustle done many years ago.

From "Americanizing" television series for the kids from Power Rangers to Ultraman, and adapting famed characters from Japanese film, games and manga to frequent disastrous effect, it still wouldn't stop the studios from going after one property after another. This time round it's the long running Dragonball series, because the assumption is that the built-in fan base would translate to instant dollars at the box office. Not.\n\nYou have to give the filmmakers a little bit of credit though, being either foolhardy, or just plain ballsy. It's a given that they cannot condense and distill the rich content into a surprisingly less than 90 minute movie, and live in the hopes of producing a sequel, or to generate a franchise (i.e. don't leave the cinema hall when the end credits start to roll). But what they successfully do, is to super-summarize the entire mythos by throwing out everything except the main gist of the entire manga, making it extremely simplistic in poor lazy-man standards in adaptation.\n\nFor the uninitiated, the film would serve as a quick launchpad to the original manga. For those with a wee bit of knowledge of what it's about (like myself), the film just treads along the same lines and doesn't offer you new information. For the fanboys, I guess you'll only get some kicks at seeing some of your favorite characters come alive, only that they look more Caucasian, and have a head full of hair when they're not supposed to (someone forgot to insist that in the contract?) That's all you're gonna get. Period.\n\nAs far as film-making and story-telling techniques go, you can see cliché after cliché being thrown at you, with the poorly and cheaply rendered special effects offering no consolation. Justin Chatwin's Goku is your typical teenager who possesses innate potential yet to be realized, and in his frustration he gets treated by peers as a loser geek. He lives with his grandpa Gohan (Randall Duk Kim in stereotypical know-it-all like in Kung Pu Panda), and develops a crush on school hottie Chi Chi (Jamie Chung). Goku's calling in life is to prevent an apocalypse from happening with the return of chief cardboard baddie Lord Piccolo (an instant shoo-in as one of the worst cinematic villains, ever!) and his temporary sidekick Mai (Eriko Tamura) who attempt to collect 7 dragonballs to fulfill an ancient myth. And of course Goku needs a Fellowship, in the form of irritating tech-wizard Bulma (Emmy Rossum last seen in the sinker Poseidon), mercenary Yum Cha (Joon Park who probably copied Rain's uninspiring cinematic turn in Speed Racer to a T) and Chow Yun-Fat the biggest name of them all here trying his darnest best to act cute as Master Roshi, who imparts skills in double quick time to Goku.\n\nSpeaking of time, or the lack thereof, everything is compressed. From two weeks to two days and the day of the blood moon shielding the yellow sun (OK so I made that up), everything moves at so fast a pace, that all you get are cheesy lines of dialog, and an excuse to paste some action sequences together. And James Wong certainly can't direct action (despite being at the helm of Jet Li's The One, which was of course bland and bad), opting to pay homage to Zack Snyder's slow-mo technique, and midway changing the style to having the camera being too close to the action, in the dark, coupled with quick MTV cuts that you don't get to see a thing.\n\nAnd the rush job just doesn't stop at the narrative or the action. Special effects wise, they look really cheap, and I wonder whether Producer Stephen Chow would roll his eyes at what would be extremely pale when put side by side with his Kung Fu Hustle done many years ago. Ayumi Hamasaki's contribution of the theme song Rule sounded really bad as well (I may get flak from her fans), and I guess having some Asian participation doesn't legitimize what is essentially a poorly done movie. Not even Chow Yun-Fat's star status could save this, and you wonder what figured when this is the movie that he gave up Red Cliff for.\n\nThis is basically a movie that only children below the age of 5 will enjoy tremendously, despite having to see 6 half-balls, contributed courtesy of the 3 lead female characters, being continuously flashed on screen, thanks to some neck plunging wardrobe (where's that malfunction when you need one?) Totally bland and really uninteresting, I would suggest sticking to the manga instead.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72287,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2009-04-15","keywords":"live action remake of anime,no title at beginning,cake,terrible dialogue,bad acting","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dragonball Evolution: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1228800793","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIwNjAxMTkzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk4NjAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIwNjAxMTkzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDk4NjAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The young warrior Son Goku sets out on a quest, racing against time and the vengeful King Piccolo, to collect a set of seven magical orbs that will grant their wielder unlimited power.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154226/","name":"Justin Chatwin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0551346/","name":"James Marsters","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939128/","name":"James Wong"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0302241/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0708870/","name":"Ben Ramsey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868066/","name":"Akira Toriyama"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And it does so in a total of four times, each time taking on the perspective of different characters all revolving around a similar timeline and spatial distance, from football lad Jeremie (Jules Pelissier), to the school flower Alice Cartier (Ana Girardot) who had just broken up with Simon, to Rabier and finally Simon himself.\n\nIt brings us back to the time of playground politics back in school, where cliques form and students hanging out normally talk a lot of trash. Gobert's story and dialogue is top notch in this aspect, keeping it all very real and perhaps this was also made more believable through the use of very raw and new actors who act with abandon without a care in the world, just as their characters in the prime of their lives would have adopted. They talk bad about others, make fun of those deemed of a different league, have this constant fixation about girls and sex, and just about having little respect for any authority.\n\nEach separate narrative thread provides perspective from a particular character's viewpoint, at times debunking some of the long held beliefs or baseless rumours that spring up in the earlier threads, iron our inconsistencies or reinforces certain facts that the audience can use to piece the puzzle together, as more and more students disappear one after another, building upon the mystery and perhaps our perception that there's a serial killer or kidnapper on the loose, and someone could be directly involved! Gobert keeps the viewer active in paying attention to little clues and things said, as we work things out in real time, like a police investigations drama where we're deep into the scheme of things and have the advantage of linearly reconstructing evidence, how everything would fit together, waiting for that pat on the back if we were to get it right.\n\nTo say any more will be to spoil the story for any intended viewer. This film is essential viewing even if the ending may be a little bit of a letdown without the usual build up and crescendo that its genre peers almost always like to slip into. Lights Out completes its cycle in a rather matter-of-factly fashion, very much in line with how mainstream papers' delivery of grisly news is compared to tabloid sensationalism which some will have to admit is what makes things interesting, at the expense of others. Ultimately it's a story about perception and how things that we perceive rightly or wrongly, can so easily be treated as facts without rigorous verification, and reminds us of the usual mantra of not counting chickens before they hatch and not to judge anyone based on appearances alone which is always deceiving.\n\nAnd yes the awesome soundtrack by Sonic Youth will be reason enough to watch this in the first place, this being a tremendous first time effort in terms of narrative complexity, message and technical delivery."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1095,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-09-22","keywords":"female nudity,topless female nudity,sex scene,murder of a teenage boy,murder","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3851446/","name":"Jules Pélissier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320759/","name":"Ana Girardot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4098287/","name":"Audrey Bastien"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1257259/","name":"Fabrice Gobert"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179503/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028908/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1257259/","name":"Fabrice Gobert"}],"duration":"PT1H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The protagonist throws his uniform in the fire and takes up a civilian dress, that is the change in his life. He decides to say good bye to the warrior life, and takes up a normal life. And we see a young lady searching for a an orphan child in the refugee camps. She finds a little girl. Together, they get a new name, passport and life. Thus the protagonist's new name is "Dheepan", as per the passport of a deceased person. The fact is that, if they make a family, it is easier for them to migrate to the West.\n\nThe "family" reach France, with some struggles and few problems finally they manage to settle down in a rural area of France. But, the place was notorious for criminal activities, gangsters and drug dealers. Dheepan gets a job as the caretaker of a building. The little girl was sent to the French school, she was trying to cop up with language and cultural barrier. The young lady was took a job as a cook and caretaker of an elderly man.\n\nThings where not very smooth, even in France. The tension between the protagonist and "family"; and the society; progress with the movie. The movie is always in tight frames to convey this suffocation. The scenes towards the climax is a worth watch. It was amazingly executed. There are some amazing shots in the movie, that is almost impossible.\n\nJacques Audiard becomes again one of my favorite directors with this movie. A definitely must watch.

The protagonist throws his uniform in the fire and takes up a civilian dress, that is the change in his life. He decides to say good bye to the warrior life, and takes up a normal life. And we see a young lady searching for a an orphan child in the refugee camps. She finds a little girl. Together, they get a new name, passport and life. Thus the protagonist's new name is "Dheepan", as per the passport of a deceased person. The fact is that, if they make a family, it is easier for them to migrate to the West.\n\nThe "family" reach France, with some struggles and few problems finally they manage to settle down in a rural area of France. But, the place was notorious for criminal activities, gangsters and drug dealers. Dheepan gets a job as the caretaker of a building. The little girl was sent to the French school, she was trying to cop up with language and cultural barrier. The young lady was took a job as a cook and caretaker of an elderly man.\n\nThings where not very smooth, even in France. The tension between the protagonist and "family"; and the society; progress with the movie. The movie is always in tight frames to convey this suffocation. The scenes towards the climax is a worth watch. It was amazingly executed. There are some amazing shots in the movie, that is almost impossible.\n\nJacques Audiard becomes again one of my favorite directors with this movie. A definitely must watch. Highly Recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15219,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-08-26","keywords":"tamil,caretaker,france,sri lankan,janitor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2043853337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNkZjFkNjEtZWE2Ni00YTI2LWJmNjktYWRjZmIwNTA2MDM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjNkZjFkNjEtZWE2Ni00YTI2LWJmNjktYWRjZmIwNTA2MDM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7316147/","name":"Jesuthasan Antonythasan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7316148/","name":"Kalieaswari Srinivasan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7316149/","name":"Claudine Vinasithamby"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049689/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0258767/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0081179/","name":"Thomas Bidegain","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4380548/","name":"Noé Debré"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The "illegal download" comment was funny though, but it was not really at place in the intro.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114782,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Fantasy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-02-17","keywords":"marvel comics,comicbook movie,weapon,motor vehicle,ghost rider character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2284953881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU1NDgzOTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzNjg4MjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDU1NDgzOTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzNjg4MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001354/","name":"Ciarán Hinds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0252961/","name":"Idris Elba"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004410/","name":"Mark Neveldine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0962729/","name":"Brian Taylor"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036225/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251916/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0991355/","name":"Scott M.

Here, the serial murder is in keeping with a French nursery rhyme that deals with the big bad wolf. Unfortunately, this movie which is besides Delplanque's first movie is far from being successful. His movie takes back too many elements that became clichés of horror movies like the raven that is synonym of a bad omen, the haunted house and the serie of sinister-looking characters. But above all, the movie doesn't succeed in hiding an obvious lack of inspiration, especially the dialogs that aren't very worked  and it doesn't hesitate in borrowing scenes from other movies. I think about "the blair witch project" when one of the actors is disappearing into the woods and about "psycho" with the murder under the shower and moreover Delplanque's making is empty and hollow. Sometimes the movie becomes ridiculous due to a few scenes like the actors' show played in front of Axel de Fersen and Nicolas and a few characters: the cop who turns up at the most awkward moment hasn't got a cop's head and mind. As far as the little boy Nicolas is concerned, he is bad used. During an important part of the movie, he stays still, the vacant look  he seems scared by the big bad wolf and he doesn't say a single word. The little actor that epitomizes him hadn't had very much work to do.... Nevertheless Fraçois Berléand is quite convincing in his role of sinister-looking character even if the movie doesn't expand his feelings to Wilfried, one of the young men.

Here, the serial murder is in keeping with a French nursery rhyme that deals with the big bad wolf. Unfortunately, this movie which is besides Delplanque's first movie is far from being successful. His movie takes back too many elements that became clichés of horror movies like the raven that is synonym of a bad omen, the haunted house and the serie of sinister-looking characters. But above all, the movie doesn't succeed in hiding an obvious lack of inspiration, especially the dialogs that aren't very worked  and it doesn't hesitate in borrowing scenes from other movies. I think about "the blair witch project" when one of the actors is disappearing into the woods and about "psycho" with the murder under the shower and moreover Delplanque's making is empty and hollow. Sometimes the movie becomes ridiculous due to a few scenes like the actors' show played in front of Axel de Fersen and Nicolas and a few characters: the cop who turns up at the most awkward moment hasn't got a cop's head and mind. As far as the little boy Nicolas is concerned, he is bad used. During an important part of the movie, he stays still, the vacant look  he seems scared by the big bad wolf and he doesn't say a single word. The little actor that epitomizes him hadn't had very much work to do.... Nevertheless Fraçois Berléand is quite convincing in his role of sinister-looking character even if the movie doesn't expand his feelings to Wilfried, one of the young men. I noticed that Berléand seems to feel love to him.... At last, the movie succeeds, sometimes, in creating an ounce of suspense and doubt in the spectator's mind: who is the big bad wolf? Who is responsible of all the murders? You'll know the answers at the end of this listless and dull movie....","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2589,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2000-06-14","keywords":"backwood slasher,actor,police,castle,birthday","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Deep In The Woods","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1923154201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUwMjU5YmUtMTAzYi00ZDFkLWFiOWItZGZiMjI4ZDhjYmYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWUwMjU5YmUtMTAzYi00ZDFkLWFiOWItZGZiMjI4ZDhjYmYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0873005/","name":"Marie Trintignant","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531204/","name":"Suzanne MacAleese","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0120683/","name":"Maud Buquet"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0217803/","name":"Lionel Delplanque"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074636/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0217803/","name":"Lionel Delplanque","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0674659/","name":"Annabelle Perrichon"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sure, it may be a little predictable and a bit 'all been done before' but there is a certain level of originality and uniqueness to it also.\n\nFor starters it has a fantastic cast and both lead actors (Jolie and Washington)have won Oscars and thats says something.

His movies are so damn entertaining. They always, well I should say most of the time, have wit and intelligence [Forget 'Showgirls' and 'Hollow Man', any director can make mistakes] and have either graphic sex or violence or both. 'Basic Instinct' is in the latter category. It is so erotic and Stone and Douglas have so much sexual chemistry that when you look at an Adrian Lyne film, you see them for the crap they are.\n\nBasic plotline has Stone's character, 'Catherine Tramell', accused of the vicious sex murder of a retired rock and roll star. Douglas's character has a strange attraction to her, which may not lead to good things..... Paul Verhoven has openly admitted that this film is a homage to Alfred Hitchcock's  classic masterpiece 'Vertigo'. In fact, Stone wears, in sequence, the same wardrobe as Kim Novak did [which makes you wonder, was she wearing panties under her clothes]. That brings us to the interrogation scene, which is the best in the movie. Stone shamelessly flirts with the cops' libidos until the buildup of sexual tension is so great, Stone releases it by playing 'peek-a-boo'  with the space in between her legs. Every male viewer cherishes that scene, simply because it is so sexy. That word can be used throughout the film, as Stone and Douglas do the mattress mumbo. At the time, the sex scenes were so realistic that the press went wild and debated whether or not viewers were witnessing un-simulated sex. The film is still quite sexually daring today and  has an intriguing spider's web plot too. The plot's twists and turns manage to make the movie sexier as the viewer wonders whether Sharon is innocent or guilty..........\n\nThe film's only misstep occurs at the end, with an unsatisfactory ending that makes the whole film seem like some stupid, contrived game. But it's not. It keeps it's fascination and it's sexiness and its suspense right up till the end, which is what a good erotic thriller should. Actually, the ending for some will lead to a lot of discussion if you watch the film with someone, as the film toys with two of the film's characters innocence or guilt and does not give up all its secrets.....\n\nThe film is great Verhoeven. It has his usual, hilarious, seemingly inappropriate kinky humor and extreme sex and violence to match. The fact that Verhoeven is actually able to balance the film and make it funny and sexy is wonderful film-making. Well, have I said 'sexy' enough times? Then go rent it.........8/10\n\nP.S. If you like this one, check out Verhoevens' Dutch film ''The Fourth Man''. It has a similar plot and even a similar character that resembles Catherine Tramell. If the ending of 'Basic Instinct' leaves you wanting, check that film out. It is even better than 'Basic' and is more 'arty'. It is also a little bit more daring erotically.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":188958,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-03-20","keywords":"erotic thriller,manipulation,female psychopath,narcissistic personality disorder,mind game","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Basic Instinct","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi129564953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWEzYmZhZTAtMWVkYi00NWQ2LWIzNWQtNTYwOTI1ZmQ1ZjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWEzYmZhZTAtMWVkYi00NWQ2LWIzNWQtNTYwOTI1ZmQ1ZjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001169/","name":"George Dzundza"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000682/","name":"Paul Verhoeven"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094459/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000390/","name":"Joe Eszterhas"}],"duration":"PT2H7M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His movies are so damn entertaining. They always, well I should say most of the time, have wit and intelligence [Forget 'Showgirls' and 'Hollow Man', any director can make mistakes] and have either graphic sex or violence or both. 'Basic Instinct' is in the latter category. It is so erotic and Stone and Douglas have so much sexual chemistry that when you look at an Adrian Lyne film, you see them for the crap they are.\n\nBasic plotline has Stone's character, 'Catherine Tramell', accused of the vicious sex murder of a retired rock and roll star. Douglas's character has a strange attraction to her, which may not lead to good things..... Paul Verhoven has openly admitted that this film is a homage to Alfred Hitchcock's  classic masterpiece 'Vertigo'. In fact, Stone wears, in sequence, the same wardrobe as Kim Novak did [which makes you wonder, was she wearing panties under her clothes]. That brings us to the interrogation scene, which is the best in the movie. Stone shamelessly flirts with the cops' libidos until the buildup of sexual tension is so great, Stone releases it by playing 'peek-a-boo'  with the space in between her legs. Every male viewer cherishes that scene, simply because it is so sexy. That word can be used throughout the film, as Stone and Douglas do the mattress mumbo. At the time, the sex scenes were so realistic that the press went wild and debated whether or not viewers were witnessing un-simulated sex. The film is still quite sexually daring today and  has an intriguing spider's web plot too. The plot's twists and turns manage to make the movie sexier as the viewer wonders whether Sharon is innocent or guilty..........\n\nThe film's only misstep occurs at the end, with an unsatisfactory ending that makes the whole film seem like some stupid, contrived game. But it's not. It keeps it's fascination and it's sexiness and its suspense right up till the end, which is what a good erotic thriller should. Actually, the ending for some will lead to a lot of discussion if you watch the film with someone, as the film toys with two of the film's characters innocence or guilt and does not give up all its secrets.....\n\nThe film is great Verhoeven. It has his usual, hilarious, seemingly inappropriate kinky humor and extreme sex and violence to match. The fact that Verhoeven is actually able to balance the film and make it funny and sexy is wonderful film-making. Well, have I said 'sexy' enough times? Then go rent it.........8/10\n\nP.S. If you like this one, check out Verhoevens' Dutch film ''The Fourth Man''. It has a similar plot and even a similar character that resembles Catherine Tramell. If the ending of 'Basic Instinct' leaves you wanting, check that film out. It is even better than 'Basic' and is more 'arty'. It is also a little bit more daring erotically.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":188958,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-03-20","keywords":"erotic thriller,manipulation,female psychopath,narcissistic personality disorder,mind game","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Basic Instinct","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi129564953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWEzYmZhZTAtMWVkYi00NWQ2LWIzNWQtNTYwOTI1ZmQ1ZjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWEzYmZhZTAtMWVkYi00NWQ2LWIzNWQtNTYwOTI1ZmQ1ZjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001169/","name":"George Dzundza"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000682/","name":"Paul Verhoeven"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094459/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000390/","name":"Joe Eszterhas"],"duration":"PT2H7M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And it is way too many 1's. This movie is no where near a one rating. I've been watching a lot of movies since I was a little kid. From cheesy 80's flicks, to straight to TV. This is no where near a 1. This movie sits at a 7 for me. Would have got an 8 but I'm super hard on the female acting in these new generation of movies.\n\nThis movie by now is 9 years old so nothing would be giving it away. But with that said Linda Hamilton in the first one was 19 years old. And she can act. Which is why 7 or 8 years later in Terminator 2 her acting was polished the movie was even better. It is not a secret if the female character can act you are going to have a good movie. The female acting in this movie was decent which is why it got a 7 from me.\n\nBut I can see why people gave this a one. The first Terminators were scary. The machine just kept going. You also had the awesome 80's music, along with the clothes. I mean seriously Sarah O conner was riding an 80's scoter and listening to head phones. And going to the club. Just a lot of vintage stuff in that movie which brought it back to the 80's. The 90's was even better in T2, crazy hair cuts, dirt bikes and the graphics in that at the time were unique. \n\nBut they did try to incorporate some of the old ideas. John Conner goes "come with me if you want to live", the motor cycle scene still is exciting as it was almost 30 years ago. The naked terminator. Normally during these remakes I get bored or fall asleep. It was action through the whole movie. I don't know if it was christian bale. Or who it was. But I felt entertained. \n\nIf people came here looking at this review thinking they are get a play by play of the movie. I'm not doing that with this one. You have to watch and please don't listen to these negative reviews. They want to live in the past on something that has already been done. \n\nOnce again don't try to watch this thinking this is going to be like the fist 2. It is not. Its just going to be great acting and simply a plot that action. Nothing over the top where its mind blowing. Expecting this movie to be like the first 1 where they were on to something new, and the second one where they had some super special effects is asking too much. It was well written movie. And its great to have all the Terminators. Cause I do.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-05-27","keywords":"kidnapping,pregnant woman,suspense,terminal illness,prisoner","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Terminator Salvation","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi360907545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEwMTE3MDgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg0MzYxMg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEwMTE3MDgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg0MzYxMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Terminator Salvation - Trailer #2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0941777/","name":"Sam Worthington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0947338/","name":"Anton Yelchin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0629334/","name":"McG"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175646/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080859/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104335/","name":"John Brancato"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274905/","name":"Michael Ferris"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But with that said Linda Hamilton in the first one was 19 years old. And she can act. Which is why 7 or 8 years later in Terminator 2 her acting was polished the movie was even better. It is not a secret if the female character can act you are going to have a good movie. The female acting in this movie was decent which is why it got a 7 from me.\n\nBut I can see why people gave this a one. The first Terminators were scary. The machine just kept going. You also had the awesome 80's music, along with the clothes. I mean seriously Sarah O conner was riding an 80's scoter and listening to head phones. And going to the club. Just a lot of vintage stuff in that movie which brought it back to the 80's. The 90's was even better in T2, crazy hair cuts, dirt bikes and the graphics in that at the time were unique. \n\nBut they did try to incorporate some of the old ideas. John Conner goes "come with me if you want to live", the motor cycle scene still is exciting as it was almost 30 years ago. The naked terminator. Normally during these remakes I get bored or fall asleep. It was action through the whole movie. I don't know if it was christian bale. Or who it was. But I felt entertained. \n\nIf people came here looking at this review thinking they are get a play by play of the movie. I'm not doing that with this one. You have to watch and please don't listen to these negative reviews. They want to live in the past on something that has already been done. \n\nOnce again don't try to watch this thinking this is going to be like the fist 2. It is not. Its just going to be great acting and simply a plot that action. Nothing over the top where its mind blowing. Expecting this movie to be like the first 1 where they were on to something new, and the second one where they had some super special effects is asking too much. It was well written movie. And its great to have all the Terminators. Cause I do.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-05-27","keywords":"kidnapping,pregnant woman,suspense,terminal illness,prisoner","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Terminator Salvation","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi360907545","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEwMTE3MDgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg0MzYxMg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEwMTE3MDgyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTg0MzYxMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Terminator Salvation - Trailer #2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0941777/","name":"Sam Worthington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0947338/","name":"Anton Yelchin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0629334/","name":"McG"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175646/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080859/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104335/","name":"John Brancato","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274905/","name":"Michael Ferris"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The political message, all businessmen are baddies and tramps are good hearted decent people, is so naive and retarded that even L'Humanite has given it up long time ago. Its utterly amazing that Dupontel was ever given the 1000 that this movie must have cost. Dupontel's attacks on consumerism are painfully boring.

This is not a poor man's Amelie Poulain or a modern Comedia del'Arte. It is trashy, ugly, not funny and an utter waste of time. The political message, all businessmen are baddies and tramps are good hearted decent people, is so naive and retarded that even L'Humanite has given it up long time ago. Its utterly amazing that Dupontel was ever given the 1000 that this movie must have cost. Dupontel's attacks on consumerism are painfully boring. One ray of sunshine though, Claude Perron who plays Marie the ex porno star. Dupontel should be locked up and made to watch Bloomberg TV all day long.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2074,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-04-05","keywords":"written and directed by cast member,violence,suicide,sex shop,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0243355/","name":"Albert Dupontel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0674816/","name":"Claude Perron","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0548169/","name":"Nicolas Marié"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0243355/","name":"Albert Dupontel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030029/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015007/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0243355/","name":"Albert Dupontel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0491011/","name":"Guillaume Laurant"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like "the only law is gravity" and "everyone dies, it's just a matter of how", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi.

Constructed with an alarming amount of real footage and physical stunt work, the numerous action set pieces are rather impressive; a high octane wing-suit gliding scene and the tension-building rock climbing finale topping the list. Yet the impact of these daredevil stunts is wasted on a film that fails on almost every other level. Stemming from Kurt Wimmer's truly awful screenplay, every second not spent traversing a mountainside, soaring through the air or surfing a mammoth wave is cringe worthy and/or yawn inducing. Wimmer's dialogue attempts to be philosophical and Zen-like, but with clichéd stinkers like "the only law is gravity" and "everyone dies, it's just a matter of how", it's nothing short of unintentionally hilarious. Replacing the eternally cool Patrick Swayze was always going to be tough, however Edgar Ramirez does a solid job as charismatic eco-warrior Bohdi. The same can't be said for low-budget-Chris-Hemsworth hunk Luke Bracey though, who is so wooden as Johnny Utah he makes Keanu Reeves look like Daniel Day Lewis.

Its nowhere near as good as Top Gun of course but its no disaster. Tom Cruise is good as the daftly named racing driver Cole Trickle and the ever reliable Robert Duvall offers classy support. Michael Rooker is excellent as Toms rival and Randy Quaid shows a more serious side to those who only know him from the Vacation movies. Surprisingly the usually good Nicole Kidman is rather bland as the love interest although to be fair she's not given a heck of a lot to work with. The music is of course all important in a movie like this and it has a pretty good soundtrack including Maria McKee's Number One hit Show Me Heaven, but again Top Gun had a much better soundtrack with Hans Zimmmer no match for Harold Faltermeyer. Tony Scott directs with his usual style, if you have seen Top Gun or Beverly Hills Cop 2 you'll no what to expect, very flashy and VERY LOUD. With a slightly less predictable story this could have been a lot better but as it is its a pretty enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":83666,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1990-06-27","keywords":"ticklishness,motor vehicle,motor car,cool,vehicle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How the Best Racing Films Raise the Stakes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi365149977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief, sponsored by Coca-Cola, we're putting the pedal to the metal on the best racing films of all time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000380/","name":"Robert Duvall"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102770/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001801/","name":"Robert Towne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Its nowhere near as good as Top Gun of course but its no disaster. Tom Cruise is good as the daftly named racing driver Cole Trickle and the ever reliable Robert Duvall offers classy support. Michael Rooker is excellent as Toms rival and Randy Quaid shows a more serious side to those who only know him from the Vacation movies. Surprisingly the usually good Nicole Kidman is rather bland as the love interest although to be fair she's not given a heck of a lot to work with. The music is of course all important in a movie like this and it has a pretty good soundtrack including Maria McKee's Number One hit Show Me Heaven, but again Top Gun had a much better soundtrack with Hans Zimmmer no match for Harold Faltermeyer. Tony Scott directs with his usual style, if you have seen Top Gun or Beverly Hills Cop 2 you'll no what to expect, very flashy and VERY LOUD. With a slightly less predictable story this could have been a lot better but as it is its a pretty enjoyable way to pass a couple of hours.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":83666,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1990-06-27","keywords":"ticklishness,motor vehicle,motor car,cool,vehicle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How the Best Racing Films Raise the Stakes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi365149977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief, sponsored by Coca-Cola, we're putting the pedal to the metal on the best racing films of all time.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000380/","name":"Robert Duvall"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102770/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001801/","name":"Robert Towne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.\n\nWe first see Richard (played by Paul Walter Hauser in one of the year's best performances) as a supply clerk at a law firm in 1986. His awkward ways and surprising efficiency catches the eye of attorney Watson Bryant (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell), a quasi-connection that comes into play a decade later. We then jump ahead those 10 years to find Richard being fired from his campus security job at a college due to his over-zealous focus on protocol. Fortunately for Richard, the Olympics are coming to Atlanta, so finding work as a security guard is pretty easy.\n\nAtlanta's Centennial Olympic Park is shown with crowds of people cheering at a Kenny Rogers and later dancing the Macarena. As one of the on-site security guards, Richard spots a suspicious backpack that turns out to be holding the bomb that detonates, creating tragedy for many. As the viewing audience, we know that Richard's actions saved lives and he most definitely was not responsible for planting the bomb. And it's that knowing that places us as close as possible to the Richard Jewell experience.\n\nFour-time Oscar winner Clint Eastwood directs yet another story of a working-class hero. Only this time, he blatantly calls out what he sees as two evil forces: the U.S. Government (the FBI) and the media. Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, SHATTERED GLASS) based his script on the 1997 Vanity Fair article "American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell" by Marie Brenner (who also wrote the article that was the source for THE INSIDER, 1999). It can be argued that Eastwood comes down hard on the FBI and the media, but you might consider putting yourself in Richard Jewell's shoes before crying foul.\n\nJon Hamm has perfected the role of cocksure FBI agent and here he plays Tom Shaw as the man totally focused on proving Richard Jewell was the perpetrator. Much has been made of Eastwood's depiction of Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde, who directed this year's surprise hit BOOKSMART). It's a bit curious that the uproar is over what some interpret as a reporter trading intimate relations for a scoop, yet Eastwood's contempt seems focused more on the idea of trying a citizen's case in public ... while lacking any real evidence outside of a profile. The reporter (Ms. Scruggs passed away in 2001) is certainly portrayed as an ultra-aggressive reporter desperate for a headline story, but the implied consensual affair occurred after the inside information was provided - and the FBI agent was actually surprised... "Is this really going to happen?" Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.\n\nTwo key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right. A rush to judgment can be seen as an abuse of power, whether it's by the media, a law enforcement agency, or folks on social media. At this stage of his career, director Eastwood seems more interested in telling stories than showing one. He offers up little visual artistry outside of the terrific performances, but this story ... it's a doozy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74442,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.\n\nTwo key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right. A rush to judgment can be seen as an abuse of power, whether it's by the media, a law enforcement agency, or folks on social media. At this stage of his career, director Eastwood seems more interested in telling stories than showing one. He offers up little visual artistry outside of the terrific performances, but this story ... it's a doozy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74442,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Since the 60's, the french directors have always been fascinating by American cinema. But most of them use the American cinema's codes to transpose them in a french environment : from Truffaut' "Tirez Sur Le Pianiste" - which plays with the stereotypes of the Film noir in a french universe - to Gans' "Pacte Des loups" - which transposes the western codes in the pre-revolutionary France.\n\nAnd it seems that, with "Quatre étoiles", Christian Vincent tries to archive this form of transformation of American's codes with the french touch. Indeed, the director quotes himself American's comedies from the 40's and says they're direct influence to make this film. "Quatre étoiles" tries to transfers the atmosphere of American's classical comedies from Los Angeles to Cannes. But unfortunately, it doesn't work. Why ? \n\nLike in a Cukor' or Lubitch' comedy, the character - a young an inconstant woman - inherit, out of nowhere, 50000 euros and decides to spend it all in a week in Cannes, where, in search of adventures, she falls in love with a small time crook, played by José Garcia. And if a lot of situations are similar to 40's and 50's American films, it never reaches their level of grace and humor.

Since the 60's, the french directors have always been fascinating by American cinema. But most of them use the American cinema's codes to transpose them in a french environment : from Truffaut' "Tirez Sur Le Pianiste" - which plays with the stereotypes of the Film noir in a french universe - to Gans' "Pacte Des loups" - which transposes the western codes in the pre-revolutionary France.\n\nAnd it seems that, with "Quatre étoiles", Christian Vincent tries to archive this form of transformation of American's codes with the french touch. Indeed, the director quotes himself American's comedies from the 40's and says they're direct influence to make this film. "Quatre étoiles" tries to transfers the atmosphere of American's classical comedies from Los Angeles to Cannes. But unfortunately, it doesn't work. Why ? \n\nLike in a Cukor' or Lubitch' comedy, the character - a young an inconstant woman - inherit, out of nowhere, 50000 euros and decides to spend it all in a week in Cannes, where, in search of adventures, she falls in love with a small time crook, played by José Garcia. And if a lot of situations are similar to 40's and 50's American films, it never reaches their level of grace and humor. It's true that we have, like in American movies, a young and in-experimented girl who knows exactly what she wants, and who decides to change her life and social position in a day, and that we also have an impossible love story between two characters who hate each other, and are still stuck together, but everything seems so small compared to its models.\n\nWhen, in a American movie, the character would have inherit millions of dollars, the character here has only a few euros left, which can't provokes great and hilarious contrasted situations.

Our national discourse is rich with portent. "It's going to get worse before it gets better", "Something horrible is coming, you'll see", "Soon there will be riots". I'm told these things at conventions and while talking to my neighbors and at breakfast with my mother's old friends. Now Jeff Nichols takes an exhausted phrase in storytelling, ("There's a storm coming") and crafts out of it the movie of the moment. A dark, symbolic mapping of the last five years of the middle-class American experience that's bursting at the mental and financial seams. I have yet to see a finer artistic expression of the current existential crises we face. Michael Shannon is the Noah of our hour, plagued with calamitous visions and barely bearing up under the weight of constant anxiety. In fact, the whole endeavor is buried in quiet distress and prescience. And when the movie finally finds the heart to redeem it's long suffering protagonist, it is through the worst of all possible outcomes.

Our national discourse is rich with portent. "It's going to get worse before it gets better", "Something horrible is coming, you'll see", "Soon there will be riots". I'm told these things at conventions and while talking to my neighbors and at breakfast with my mother's old friends. Now Jeff Nichols takes an exhausted phrase in storytelling, ("There's a storm coming") and crafts out of it the movie of the moment. A dark, symbolic mapping of the last five years of the middle-class American experience that's bursting at the mental and financial seams. I have yet to see a finer artistic expression of the current existential crises we face. Michael Shannon is the Noah of our hour, plagued with calamitous visions and barely bearing up under the weight of constant anxiety. In fact, the whole endeavor is buried in quiet distress and prescience. And when the movie finally finds the heart to redeem it's long suffering protagonist, it is through the worst of all possible outcomes. Essential viewing for our times.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":97151,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-11-10","keywords":"schizophrenia,ambiguous ending,psychological,storm,storm shelter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Take Shelter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3746995481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDkyODA4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUwNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDkyODA4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjUwNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Plagued by a series of apocalyptic visions, a young husband and father questions whether to shelter his family from a coming storm, or from himself.

Actually Noah was nowhere near as bad as heard, and while very flawed and by far the worst film of Darren Aronofsky(with his others ranging from very good to outstanding) it did have some impressive things. On the most part the film is brilliant visually, the barren apocalyptic landscapes and later more colourful ones were really striking and the cinematography has a sweeping yet somewhat surrealistic effect. The opening and creation sequences were beautifully done with the latter quite harrowing without being too heavy-handed, and the flood scene was intense and jaw-dropping in spectacle. Noah's dreams had a real creepiness too. Clint Mansell's music score swells thrillingly and has an epic sweep, enhancing crucial scenes and not drowning stuff out. The sound is thrilling in its authenticity too. There are some good performances, the best of which coming from Russell Crowe, who plays with real steel and a powerful charisma. Jennifer Connelly is a sympathetic and touching wife and mother figure, and has a scene in the last act that really does hit home and is not over-the-top. Some have disliked Emma Watson's performance but for me she brought genuine heart to a role that was more of a plot-device up until the last act, at that point she becomes the character you relate to the most. Anthony Hopkins does not have much to do but he is gleefully enjoyable in his role of Methusalah.\n\nNoah did personally fall very short though, and actually the little relation to the Bible no matter how people carp on about it is the least of its problems. Douglas Booth is rather bland and too pretty-boy-model-like while Logan Lerman came across as wooden and forced, Ham could easily have been the character we related to but for that to happen I think the film could have expanded much more on his character arc and situation. Ray Winstone is the most disappointing, he's done some great performances but this is not one of them, he is saddled with a very clichéd villain role that has no development to him and he overdoes it in a way that feels straight out of another film entirely. The characters generally are underdeveloped, especially the villain and Ham's subplot had potential to be expanded much more but Ila's character has a lot of heart and effort is made to humanise Noah although some of his decision making comes across as rather sudden. \n\nThe special effects are a mixed bag, the flood effects are outstanding and the built-to-scale ark also looks incredible, both of which with much grandeur. But the Rock Monsters(or the Watchers) have a dated look, are written in a way that feels irrelevant to the story or in a way that doesn't gel with everything else going on and slightly like Transformers clones, and some of the animals(notably the snakes) look like computerised toys that don't blend within the scenery very well. The dialogue does often feel stilted and confused, especially in the first act, while taking an overwrought if well-intentioned turn in the last and coming across as a little heavy-handed in places. The story does have a number of bright spots and contains some powerful messaging, but does drag a fair bit and has some stuff that felt like filler, the film easily could have been half-an-hour shorter. The story is also a bit of a weird one, and one that leaves more questions than answers, in a sense that it does feel like it doesn't quite know what it wants to be, there's some sci-fi, some action-epic and some character-driven study(which takes up the last act), all three of which with uneven results. The ending is for my liking a bit too convenient as well. Aronofsky's direction is broad and is at home with the style of the film and the spectacle but he fails to make the story properly engage(which is unusual for Aronofsky). Overall, ambitious but uneven. Noah is nowhere near as bad as a lot of the negative reviews have said and the stick it gets for not being close to the Bible is on the unfair side- in all fairness though Noah was advertised in a way that was suggestive that it was an adaptation of the biblical story when really it is the bare bones- but it does have a lot of flaws and could have been better considering how much talent was on board. 5/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":248671,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-03-26","keywords":"ark,old testament,supernatural power,water,family relationships","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi225552921","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjkwODYwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI5OTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc5MjkwODYwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI5OTEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inspired by the Biblical story, a man suffering visions of an apocalyptic deluge takes measures to protect his family a coming flood.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000124/","name":"Jennifer Connelly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062935/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359504/","name":"Ari Handel"}],"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A medical researcher pushes the bounds of professional ethics as he attempts to extract a natural cure for his dying wife. A traveller in deep space attempts to make it to a dying star wrapped within a nebula in order to spend eternity with his destined love.\n\nThe Fountain got mixed reviews when it came out for a short cinema run in the UK. Perhaps understandably because, although he is hailed by some, he is dismissed by others. So far my experiences have seen me fall into the middle ground as Pi didn't totally win me over the way it did others but I did find Requiem for a Dream to be as impressive as I had heard. So I came to the Fountain unsure of what I would find and not sure if I would like it or if I would struggle with how impenetrable the ploy summaries and comments did make it sound. At first glance it does seem this way because the link between the three stories (and the nature of at least two of the them) does make it seem like a concept to be cracked and pieced together. I do think coming at it like this will only lead to frustration. It is my belief that the modern section is real and that the other two exist within the book  this explanation helped me as it allowed me to focus on the emotion and themes within these sections rather than trying figure out the exact narrative reason for a bald man inside a spaceship that looks like a bubble.\n\nBy doing this I was left with a film that I found interesting from start to finish, with the theme of movement from life to death and perhaps rebirth being one that was explored visually as much as it was in the material. To say it like this does run the risk of making it sound corny but rather, with this approach, it does work really well, layering ideas and themes to awesome effect. The central relationship holds the film together and, although some have criticised the other two threads as weaker, I personally saw them as being as much of the main thread as the main scenes were themselves. I was surprised by how touched I was at points and found myself watching a sci-fi with an intense human story running throughout it (or vice versa  I'm not sure).\n\nSome have said that Aronofsky's style as director is a bit cold and distant from his subjects. Technically I agree with that, which is why the performances are all the more important here. While the camera may not be about the heart, the performances must be and accordingly we get a pair of tremendous performances from the two stars. Jackman dominates the film. It must have been difficult to find his character in the midst of so many effects and concepts but he does it and, while you can see a lot of effort is being put in technically in some scenes, he never loses the focus on what he is trying to do. Weisz has less time and less of the material but she does almost as well  really connecting with Jackman and making her acceptance of transition seem convincing  something I saw as key in the delivery. Burstyn has a small role, while famous faces such as Thomas, Margolis, Curtis and Suplee provide solid turns even if their time is limited.\n\nAlthough he is cold as a director there is no doubting that Aronofsky is a skilled director with a great creative force. His control of the theme across the film sees Libatique producing a wonderful control of light that I cannot even begin to comprehend how he created what he wanted and managed to capture it on film. The space sequences will catch the eye most but I was just as impressed with the use of light in the present-day scenes as the use of distant light, being just out of the light etc was an excellent visual extension of the theme.\n\nAs I expected, on the surface of it this is not an easy film to crack and, although not inaccessible, it is understandable why it didn't rip in a massive mainstream audience. However at its core it is a simple and touching tale, that is cleverly expanded thematically across the bookend threads. While the director and talented crew seem to focus on the technical delivery of the themes, they are matched with a masterful turn from Jackman  meaning that the emotion is right there the whole time, holding us in a story that is inventive and technically impressive as much as it is human."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":233812,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-11-22","keywords":"tree,mayan,eternity,love,tree of life","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Fountain","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2582774041","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFlMzMwYWMtMGM4NS00YjIxLTkyMWYtYzlmNTA3NmYxZDA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFlMzMwYWMtMGM4NS00YjIxLTkyMWYtYzlmNTA3NmYxZDA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001838/","name":"Rachel Weisz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859503/","name":"Sean Patrick Thomas"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062935/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359504/","name":"Ari Handel"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I do think coming at it like this will only lead to frustration. It is my belief that the modern section is real and that the other two exist within the book  this explanation helped me as it allowed me to focus on the emotion and themes within these sections rather than trying figure out the exact narrative reason for a bald man inside a spaceship that looks like a bubble.\n\nBy doing this I was left with a film that I found interesting from start to finish, with the theme of movement from life to death and perhaps rebirth being one that was explored visually as much as it was in the material. To say it like this does run the risk of making it sound corny but rather, with this approach, it does work really well, layering ideas and themes to awesome effect. The central relationship holds the film together and, although some have criticised the other two threads as weaker, I personally saw them as being as much of the main thread as the main scenes were themselves. I was surprised by how touched I was at points and found myself watching a sci-fi with an intense human story running throughout it (or vice versa  I'm not sure).\n\nSome have said that Aronofsky's style as director is a bit cold and distant from his subjects. Technically I agree with that, which is why the performances are all the more important here. While the camera may not be about the heart, the performances must be and accordingly we get a pair of tremendous performances from the two stars. Jackman dominates the film. It must have been difficult to find his character in the midst of so many effects and concepts but he does it and, while you can see a lot of effort is being put in technically in some scenes, he never loses the focus on what he is trying to do. Weisz has less time and less of the material but she does almost as well  really connecting with Jackman and making her acceptance of transition seem convincing  something I saw as key in the delivery. Burstyn has a small role, while famous faces such as Thomas, Margolis, Curtis and Suplee provide solid turns even if their time is limited.\n\nAlthough he is cold as a director there is no doubting that Aronofsky is a skilled director with a great creative force. His control of the theme across the film sees Libatique producing a wonderful control of light that I cannot even begin to comprehend how he created what he wanted and managed to capture it on film. The space sequences will catch the eye most but I was just as impressed with the use of light in the present-day scenes as the use of distant light, being just out of the light etc was an excellent visual extension of the theme.\n\nAs I expected, on the surface of it this is not an easy film to crack and, although not inaccessible, it is understandable why it didn't rip in a massive mainstream audience. However at its core it is a simple and touching tale, that is cleverly expanded thematically across the bookend threads. While the director and talented crew seem to focus on the technical delivery of the themes, they are matched with a masterful turn from Jackman  meaning that the emotion is right there the whole time, holding us in a story that is inventive and technically impressive as much as it is human.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":233812,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-11-22","keywords":"tree,mayan,eternity,love,tree of life","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Fountain","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2582774041","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFlMzMwYWMtMGM4NS00YjIxLTkyMWYtYzlmNTA3NmYxZDA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFlMzMwYWMtMGM4NS00YjIxLTkyMWYtYzlmNTA3NmYxZDA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001838/","name":"Rachel Weisz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859503/","name":"Sean Patrick Thomas"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062935/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004716/","name":"Darren Aronofsky","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359504/","name":"Ari Handel"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

With a stunning central performance by Gary Oldman, confident and passionate directing from Joe Wright, and a brilliant screenplay from start to finish, Darkest Hour is a simply exceptional film.\n\nWhen telling a story as well-known as that of Winston Churchill and the Second World War, being both exciting and historically accurate isn't always easy, but that's where the unique take on the historical drama of Darkest Hour comes in.\n\nYes, it does tell of the extreme intensity of the early days of the war, the political manoeuvring in Westminster as Churchill was appointed Prime Minister, and the very real and impending threat that the fall of Britain could very well mean the end of freedom-loving Western civilisation, which are all absolutely fascinating to watch unfold, but they're all parts of history that you arguably already know very well.\n\nThat's why the film's decision to bring a brilliant sense of humour and a strong passion to proceedings is so effective. The importance of the events being portrayed on screen is never downplayed, and there are indeed some very intense and emotionally powerful moments, but there's so much more to Darkest Hour than just history, something that made it such a refreshing watch compared to how most Oscar-bait biographies turn out.\n\nAbove all, what impressed me most about the film was the fact that it's just so funny. It's by no means a comedy, but this isn't a pompous and dry historical drama, but one that takes glee in pointing out the eccentricities in its main character, eccentricities which are undoubtedly a part of why Churchill is so lauded and respected to this day.\n\nWhile the film praises Churchill's bulldog spirit in fighting the fight against the Nazis, it's always keen to show him in a slightly brighter light, almost as if he was a man who stumbled into the most important job in history by coincidence. In that, there are so many genuinely hilarious scenes as Churchill's quirky personality clashes with the more uptight politicians of Westminster, a part of the film that I felt not only made everything more entertaining, but helped to give the movie an incredibly refreshing energy, allowing me to see Churchill in a very relatable, personal light rather than just as a historical figure from a textbook.\n\nAs well as being downright hilarious at points, there's a real passion behind the film's depiction of the darkest hours of the war. With Churchill being forced over to opening peace talks with Hitler, the film does an incredible job at inspiring you to a point of fever pitch, fully backing Churchill's bulldog spirit to fight and defend freedom to the very last moment, meaning that the internal conflict he suffers throughout the film is such a riveting focal point.\n\nThis is an undoubtedly patriotic film, and heaps a lot of praise onto Churchill's gusto, but that doesn't mean it's overly jingoistic. There may be a case that Brits watching the film will feel more emotion from its incredible passion, but I still feel that most of that comes from how well the character of Churchill is developed throughout, from a bumbling, mumbling, lovable old man to a truly honest and principled leader.\n\nFinally, we have to talk about Gary Oldman's performance, which is amazing. For one, thanks of course in part to the make-up and costume teams, it's pretty impossible to tell that you're watching Gary Oldman in this movie. But not only does he look nothing like Oldman, and so much more like Churchill, but everything about Oldman's performance, from the smallest details about Churchill to his fantastic passion and energy on screen, pulls you further and further into the moment, and creates an exceptionally convincing portrayal of the great man and the situation surrounding him, which I was blown away by.\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved Darkest Hour. It's an undoubtedly riveting historical drama about a crucial turning point in global history, but more than that, it's full of incredible energy from start to finish, with amazing and still appropriate humour throughout combined with stunning patriotic passion, making for a genuinely exciting and properly entertaining film that does so much more than your typical Oscar-bait fare.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":184944,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-12-22","keywords":"world war two,speech,prime minister,politics,winston churchill character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3915626777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk0OTM5MDIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2Nzk2MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDk0OTM5MDIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2Nzk2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"This true story begins at the precipice of World War II as, within days of becoming Prime Minister of Great Britain, Winston Churchill (Academy Award nominee Gary Oldman) must face one of his most turbulent and defining trials: exploring a negotiated peace treaty with Nazi Germany, or standing firm to fight for the ideals, liberty and freedom of a nation.

Mindy's character gets hired to work for Emma's Late Night talk show to help get it back on track to avoid cancellation. Mindy is incredibly charming, sweet and very opinionated in her role. These two ladies knock it out of the park and will make you laugh and cry. It's not every day we get to see a team up like this.

Emma and Mindy are an amazing pair. It's a little reminiscent of Devil Wears Prada but in only the best of ways. Emma Thompson brings a vulnerability to her stern, straight laced character who is stuck in her own ways. Mindy's character gets hired to work for Emma's Late Night talk show to help get it back on track to avoid cancellation. Mindy is incredibly charming, sweet and very opinionated in her role. These two ladies knock it out of the park and will make you laugh and cry. It's not every day we get to see a team up like this. The story is passionate, the jokes are hilarious, and the emotions are sincere. I highly recommend, it was a good time at the movies.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34071,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-06-14","keywords":"f rated,fictional television talk show host,television writer,fictional tv show,fictional late night tv show","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1865858073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjc1NjYwOTUtYTExZS00NDViLWFiMTYtZmRmZGEyNGRmZjQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjc1NjYwOTUtYTExZS00NDViLWFiMTYtZmRmZGEyNGRmZjQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"After almost 30 years, a groundbreaking talk-show host suspects she may soon be losing her coveted seat on late-night television unless she manages a game-changing transformation in Late Night, the first feature film from Emmy-nominated writer and producer Mindy Kaling.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000668/","name":"Emma Thompson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1411676/","name":"Mindy Kaling","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001475/","name":"John Lithgow"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0304091/","name":"Nisha Ganatra"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0661865/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251858/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1411676/","name":"Mindy Kaling"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Splendid!","reviewBody":"I need to get something off my chest: I'm not a fan of Tommy Lee Jones. I find him limited in range, much the same in most roles and, worst of all, he inexplicably won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar for The Fugitive, thus depriving Pete Postlethwaite for In the Name of the Father, Leonardo Di Caprio for What's Eating Gilbert Grape and Ralph Fiennes for his performance of pure evil as Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. In modern parlance, WTF? \n\nBut periodically, just occasionally, once in a while, he inhabits the screen in a manner that forces one to reconsider one's judgment. And so it is with The Homesman.\n\nThe Homesman is something of a surprise, and not just because Tommy Lee Jones is on remarkable form in it. Beyond a fine performance, the man writes, directs and co-produces it. Hell's bells, when did he become so damn good at everything? \n\nIn the bad old days of the pioneers in the Wild West, Mary Bee Cuddy (Hilary Swank) steps in when three women drift into various states of madness and need to be transported across the country to be cared for properly. Shunned by their husbands, denied help from the town's menfolk and at a time where rape and murder hides behind every outcrop of rock and every gnarled cactus, Cuddy sets off alone on her hazardous journey. She stumbles across George Briggs (Tommy Lee Jones), a drifter seated atop his horse, with a noose around his neck, waiting for his steed to grow bored and leave him hanging. Literally. Cuddy offers to save him on the condition that he accompanies her and so begins a particular kind of journey.\n\nThe Homesman is probably described by many as a western, but that's lazy. This is a road movie on horseback, a saunter across the plains, a journey through mistrust and emotions where a mistake or misplaced trust will result in death. It is a story of hope and love, not the romantic kind, but real love for one's fellow human being, regardless of whether they can, or will, reciprocate.\n\nShot beautifully with sprawling, dusty vistas that warm the heart and prickle the nape, the backdrop is a vast canvas of character and mystery upon which splashes of colour are smeared in the shape of wandering, human dangers.\n\nThough they say little, the trio of women (Grace Gummer, Miranda Otto and Sonja Richter) are far more than peripheral characters or the MacGuffin; they are the substance that binds The Homesman and the reason for the drama, gentle though it is. As we saw in Mr. Turner, such characters can so easily become pantomime animals with over performance that slaps the viewer in the face and detracts from the whole, of which they are but a small part. Not so here. Grace Gummer, particularly, as the mostly mute but vacantly animated Arabella is terrific and we want to reach into the screen and gently push her back towards sanity. It is a beautiful, understated performance that remains in mind long after the event.\n\nTommy Lee Jones and Hilary Swank make a surprising double act but the chemistry is there in abundance. Both Cuddy and Briggs carry their own needs and daemons with them; neither would give the other a second glance ordinarily but circumstance prompts odd, emotional couplings and theirs is fraught with suspicion and obligation. It is fantastic to see Swank back to the form that brought her gongs and made us sit up and watch in Boys Don't Cry and Million Dollar Baby. This is a far less demonstrative performance, but no less steely or impactful because of it.\n\nTommy Lee Jones's performance is the most compelling, engrossing that I can recall. Beyond that, his direction is worth celebrating loudly. The Homesman is only his second feature as director (after 2006's wonderful but little seen The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada) but there are hints that he may step into Clint Eastwood's shoes alongside Ben Affleck and Sean Penn. Just when we think we have the measure of this tale, he belts us sharply around the jowls, proving he has the mettle to surprise and shock us out of our complacency.\n\nMaybe, after years and years of apparently coasting, broodily on film and staring into space, it will transpire he was merely absorbing, waiting for the moment to own both sides of the screen and captivate us.\n\nYou know what, maybe he's always been this good but I just didn't see it.\n\nFor more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32039,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"2014-05-18","keywords":"suicide by hanging,suicide,driven insane,abusive marriage,hanging","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1203089177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTE3NTgyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgxMDk2MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkzMTE3NTgyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgxMDk2MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When three women living on the edge of the American frontier are driven mad by harsh pioneer life, the task of saving them falls to the pious, independent-minded Mary Bee Cuddy.

Brad is all over the place. The film starts with a great sequence for approx. 7 minutes, which is captivating and visually stunning. Unfortunately, then it gets to a slow-burn mode till the story develops a bit more and we get to see another visually impressive sequence past 30 minutes. It does get more interesting later on and together with the visual impact (a kind of dreamy action sequences) and the nicely written score you will want to sit this through the end. Acting is good and for fans of Brad Pitt, this works perfect as he is in almost every scene. Science...well i am not an expert here but the things portrayed in the film are not really tied to exact science. It is the future after all and humanity knows more, right? I would not read too much into that; it will help you enjoy the film more.

Brad is all over the place. The film starts with a great sequence for approx. 7 minutes, which is captivating and visually stunning. Unfortunately, then it gets to a slow-burn mode till the story develops a bit more and we get to see another visually impressive sequence past 30 minutes. It does get more interesting later on and together with the visual impact (a kind of dreamy action sequences) and the nicely written score you will want to sit this through the end. Acting is good and for fans of Brad Pitt, this works perfect as he is in almost every scene. Science...well i am not an expert here but the things portrayed in the film are not really tied to exact science. It is the future after all and humanity knows more, right? I would not read too much into that; it will help you enjoy the film more. In contrast with some negative and maybe unrealistic reviews that I read here, if you like a mix of mild father-son drama together with sci-fi, this is a very nice film to watch. 8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213295,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-09-20","keywords":"astronaut,outer space,father son relationship,moon,missing father","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ad Astra","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3836788505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1550948/","name":"Ruth Negga"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0452101/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0719257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1342473/","name":"Ethan Gross"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sometimes I think it's fair to define a good film just by the good feeling you have while watching it.\n\n9 out of 10.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28008,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2003-10-22","keywords":"prison escape,odd couple,on the run,buddy movie,manhunt","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3880435225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc5YjBkZmEtY2FkNS00NjJkLWIyMDUtYmU2MTg2MTgwYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc5YjBkZmEtY2FkNS00NjJkLWIyMDUtYmU2MTg2MTgwYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000367/","name":"Gérard Depardieu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000606/","name":"Jean Reno","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006939/","name":"Richard Berry"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039740/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046075/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296829/","name":"Serge Frydman"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So when I saw the trailer for Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, I was excited. I saw it on Friday and I absolutely enjoyed this fun family film. I think this even had a more coherent plot as well, plus how could you not love the penguins? They are absolutely hilarious and need their own movie, maybe a Full Metal Jacket with penguins! Anyways, I loved the characters so much, they're back and better than ever. They even ended up giving the little old lady from the first Madagascar who fought Alex the Lion, she has a bigger role and was so awesome to watch and listen too. I think the jokes were even funnier than the first Madagascar, my favorite scene without a doubt was the plane sequence in the beginning. But the whole story was just a blast to watch.\n\nAlex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman are still looking to go back to Africa, everything seems to be a good and they start to fly back with the penguins as well as Julien. But the plane runs out of fuel and crashes, they are still in Africa, but bump into an animal pack where Alex finds his long lost parents, Marty finds out that all zebras are like him(imagine being surrounded by 1,000 Chris Rocks*shudder*), Gloria has a hunky hippo who is crushing on her, and Melman becomes the giraffe witch doctor of his group. Alex is about to be initiated into his pride, but one lion does not want him part of the group and will do anything to become leader.\n\nMadagascar: Escape 2 Africa is definitely worth your watch, it's not the animated film of the year, but it was a lot of fun to watch. It kind of reminded me of The Lion King a little bit, it has a similar story. It's a great family film and is fun for both the kids and the adults as well. Although I still think it's funny that Alex is voiced by Ben Stiller and his dad is voiced by Bernie Mac, but it's all good, who knows, maybe Alex's dad just had a little more soul in him. I would recommend this film, it was a lot of fun to watch and I suggest we write in a script for those penguins! They're a blast to watch on screen.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":214268,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-11-26","keywords":"cult film,male protagonist,elephant,lion cub,crash landing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2831286553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NDI1ODE4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NDI1ODE4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second theatrical trailer for Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, directed by  Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001674/","name":"Chris Rock"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001710/","name":"David Schwimmer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201509/","name":"Eric Darnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569891/","name":"Tom McGrath"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1000113/","name":"Etan Cohen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201509/","name":"Eric Darnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569891/","name":"Tom McGrath"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So when I saw the trailer for Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, I was excited. I saw it on Friday and I absolutely enjoyed this fun family film. I think this even had a more coherent plot as well, plus how could you not love the penguins? They are absolutely hilarious and need their own movie, maybe a Full Metal Jacket with penguins! Anyways, I loved the characters so much, they're back and better than ever. They even ended up giving the little old lady from the first Madagascar who fought Alex the Lion, she has a bigger role and was so awesome to watch and listen too. I think the jokes were even funnier than the first Madagascar, my favorite scene without a doubt was the plane sequence in the beginning. But the whole story was just a blast to watch.\n\nAlex, Marty, Gloria, and Melman are still looking to go back to Africa, everything seems to be a good and they start to fly back with the penguins as well as Julien. But the plane runs out of fuel and crashes, they are still in Africa, but bump into an animal pack where Alex finds his long lost parents, Marty finds out that all zebras are like him(imagine being surrounded by 1,000 Chris Rocks*shudder*), Gloria has a hunky hippo who is crushing on her, and Melman becomes the giraffe witch doctor of his group. Alex is about to be initiated into his pride, but one lion does not want him part of the group and will do anything to become leader.\n\nMadagascar: Escape 2 Africa is definitely worth your watch, it's not the animated film of the year, but it was a lot of fun to watch. It kind of reminded me of The Lion King a little bit, it has a similar story. It's a great family film and is fun for both the kids and the adults as well. Although I still think it's funny that Alex is voiced by Ben Stiller and his dad is voiced by Bernie Mac, but it's all good, who knows, maybe Alex's dad just had a little more soul in him. I would recommend this film, it was a lot of fun to watch and I suggest we write in a script for those penguins! They're a blast to watch on screen.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":214268,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-11-26","keywords":"cult film,male protagonist,elephant,lion cub,crash landing","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2831286553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NDI1ODE4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1NDI1ODE4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second theatrical trailer for Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa, directed by  Eric Darnell and Tom McGrath.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001674/","name":"Chris Rock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001710/","name":"David Schwimmer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201509/","name":"Eric Darnell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569891/","name":"Tom McGrath"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1000113/","name":"Etan Cohen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201509/","name":"Eric Darnell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569891/","name":"Tom McGrath"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There are so many well developed characters in this show, yet there is still so much we do not know about them. We get a few hints each episode. I love the complex relationships these intriguing characters are involved in. The plot is intricate and moves at a fast pace without sacrificing believability. \n\nThere are a lot of insider references made to Mormon culture and religion. But you do not have to know a lot about the LDS church to enjoy the show. \n\nBill and his family live in nice suburban style Salt Lake City neighborhood. In many ways they seem so normal, they make polygamy seem normal. But when the story takes place in the polygamous compound things seem anything but normal. Two sides of polygamy, as different as night and day. \n\nBill and his family have a difficult time keeping their lifestyle a secret, this creates moral dilemmas as well as making the average nosy neighbor or coworker a very real threat. But Bill's biggest antagonist is Roman, the leader and prophet of the polygamist compound he was raised in. \n\nBill's wives are very different in about every way. His first wife is really the typical Mormon wife and mom, very down to earth, modestly dressed but fashionable and very kind. His second wife, Nicki, is from the compound. She dresses in the prairie style of the compound, she is very manipulative and self centered. She is the daughter of Roman and her allegiance to her husband is questionable. The third wife, Margie, is the youngest. She is ditsy and insecure. By the way she dresses it appears that she may not be Mormon. She also provides the comic relief for the program.\n\nThis show is definitely thought provoking as well as entertaining. I can hardly wait till next season. It is definitely worth catching up on the episodes if you haven't seen it, you won't regret it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20835,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-03-12","keywords":"polygamist,large family,gay mormon,polygamy,secret","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000200/","name":"Bill Paxton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000675/","name":"Jeanne Tripplehorn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001721/","name":"Chloë Sevigny"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050662/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036575/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0647739/","name":"Mark V.

I don't agree with 'the principle', but I do like the series.\n\nThey've taken a potentially combustible premise and managed to make it charming and almost 'normal' - after a few episodes, it didn't seem odd at all that Bill has more than one wife. I like the interaction between the characters, the women in particular, and the side-story involving Bruce Dern is hilarious and tragic at the same time. They're walking a fine line here, and I would say, after viewing 2 seasons' worth of episodes now, they're pulling it off magnificently.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20762,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-03-12","keywords":"polygamist,large family,gay mormon,polygamy,secret","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000200/","name":"Bill Paxton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000675/","name":"Jeanne Tripplehorn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001721/","name":"Chloë Sevigny"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050662/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036575/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0647739/","name":"Mark V.

I didn't know if I would like it or not, because I'm not a big ER fan, due to the depressing parts, however "Grey's Anatomy" has a lot more depth to it on so many levels. Let's face it, who really wants to talk about death? This show involves some humor, unlike ER, but you also get the blood and guts popping out, very sad moments, more involved stories about the DR's personal life's, issues that are bombarding our medical care in this country today and the great music puts it over the top. It's more of a "tug at your heart strings" kind of show when it comes to death and also there are some politics involved, which i highly think should be brought up in this day and age-such as being a full donor and saving peoples lives, rather than rotting away. I'm actually surprised it's not a David Kelly Show (Boston Legal) - it seems like something he'd create. Anyway, you have to watch this show- it's completely addicting-- and I only watched it since i like Patrick Dempsey on the off chance it may be a good show--Wow, was I pleasantly surprised. I did also like Boston Legal, but not nearly like "Greys." Hopefully there is room for both of them on Sunday nights.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":272481,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Some storylines were risqué for the time, which made it all the more interesting.

It's not a bad show and the new characters aren't terrible, but there's a certain depth missing here. There was more to the L Word than affairs, it was about power dynamics, whilst at the same time being goofy and at times off the wall.

Unknown to humanity, a blood feud raged between a ruling class of vampires and rebellious legion of werewolves known as Lycans. Legend tells that the war began with two brothers, the immortal sons of Alexander Corvinus(Derek Jacobi). Marcus(Tony Curran) bitten by bat became the blood leader of the vampires. William(Brian Steele) , bitten by wolf became the first and most powerful Lycan. For six centuries Selene(Kate Beckinsale) was a loyal soldier of the vampire clan, but she was betrayed. The war was not as it had seemed. In one night, the lies that had united the kind vampire had been exposed. Kraven, the second-in-command had formed a secret alliance with Lucian, ruler of the werewolf clan to overthrow Viktor(Bill Nighy), vampires leader . But Kraven's lust for power and domination had failed. But Viktor was not the savior they had been led to believe. He has betrayed them all. Soon the hunt would be on for his killer. Selene has but one ally left : Michael(Scott Speedman), the human descendant of Corvinus. Neither vampire nor Lycan, but a hybrid. It's only a matter of time before they're found. Their only hope now is to awaken to Markus , the last remaining Elder and expose the truth, before Kraven tries to murder him while he's still in hibernation. Kraven knows he's match for him awake. Meanwhile, Selene and Michael are going to Tanis's(Steven Mackintosh) fortress for getting information. As the war between vampires and werewolves get more personal and deadly , they decide to launch a full-scale attack on the hideout in order to extinguish the race.\n\nThis exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, graphic violence, brief nudism with mild sex scene and is pretty entertaining. Packs large amount of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount, several vampires and werewolves are staked bloodily in the chest, even more impaled with large claws. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood and numerous get shot up with bullets. Most of vampires, Lycans and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score by Marco Beltrani and colorful and dark cinematography by Simon Duggan . Spectacular production design by Patrick Tatopoulos. He's author of set design and production design of known blockbusters, such as 10.000 BC, Indepencence day, I robot, Resident evil, Pith black among them. The motion picture is well directed by Len Wiseman, Kate Beckinsale's husband . He's also the screenwriter along with Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux. All participate in the following, a prequel in pre-production, titled 'Rise of the Lycans' directed by Patrick Tatopoulos and with similar actors. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampires-werewolves films or those enjoy in general.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":194624,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Fantasy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-02-22","keywords":"vampire,werewolf,selene character,2000s,titillation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Underworld: Evolution","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3302360601","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU3NTU1MmYtMjQ1Mi00YjgwLTg0NzYtYTI0YzAwMjFlMDdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU3NTU1MmYtMjQ1Mi00YjgwLTg0NzYtYTI0YzAwMjFlMDdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Underworld: Evolution"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000295/","name":"Kate Beckinsale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005454/","name":"Scott Speedman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0631490/","name":"Bill Nighy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936482/","name":"Len Wiseman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0160898/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564286/","name":"Danny McBride"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936482/","name":"Len Wiseman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0340485/","name":"Kevin Grevioux"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But Kraven's lust for power and domination had failed. But Viktor was not the savior they had been led to believe. He has betrayed them all. Soon the hunt would be on for his killer. Selene has but one ally left : Michael(Scott Speedman), the human descendant of Corvinus. Neither vampire nor Lycan, but a hybrid. It's only a matter of time before they're found. Their only hope now is to awaken to Markus , the last remaining Elder and expose the truth, before Kraven tries to murder him while he's still in hibernation. Kraven knows he's match for him awake. Meanwhile, Selene and Michael are going to Tanis's(Steven Mackintosh) fortress for getting information. As the war between vampires and werewolves get more personal and deadly , they decide to launch a full-scale attack on the hideout in order to extinguish the race.\n\nThis exciting movie displays unstopped action, thrills ride, spectacular fighting, graphic violence, brief nudism with mild sex scene and is pretty entertaining. Packs large amount of guts and gore , there's a huge body count, this one actually knocks off an immense amount, several vampires and werewolves are staked bloodily in the chest, even more impaled with large claws. There's really savage decapitation, plenty of bodies ripped in scraps and half, including some of the most tears ever, that spill lots of blood and numerous get shot up with bullets. Most of vampires, Lycans and humans victims are relegated to being bitten in the throat and neck. Magnificent special and visual effects as well as excellent make-up department. Bone-chilling and atmospheric musical score by Marco Beltrani and colorful and dark cinematography by Simon Duggan . Spectacular production design by Patrick Tatopoulos. He's author of set design and production design of known blockbusters, such as 10.000 BC, Indepencence day, I robot, Resident evil, Pith black among them. The motion picture is well directed by Len Wiseman, Kate Beckinsale's husband . He's also the screenwriter along with Danny McBride and Kevin Grevioux. All participate in the following, a prequel in pre-production, titled 'Rise of the Lycans' directed by Patrick Tatopoulos and with similar actors. Recommended to those who amuse those kind of vampires-werewolves films or those enjoy in general.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":194624,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Fantasy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-02-22","keywords":"vampire,werewolf,selene character,2000s,titillation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Underworld: Evolution","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3302360601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU3NTU1MmYtMjQ1Mi00YjgwLTg0NzYtYTI0YzAwMjFlMDdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODU3NTU1MmYtMjQ1Mi00YjgwLTg0NzYtYTI0YzAwMjFlMDdhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Underworld: Evolution","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000295/","name":"Kate Beckinsale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005454/","name":"Scott Speedman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0631490/","name":"Bill Nighy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936482/","name":"Len Wiseman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0160898/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564286/","name":"Danny McBride","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936482/","name":"Len Wiseman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0340485/","name":"Kevin Grevioux"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Convinced that it is his turn to score the big haul, Tyne convinces his crew to go on one last run before the end of the season and heads for the North Atlantic.  He never figured Mother Nature into his plans.\n\nI remember reading about the Andrea Gail soon after "The Storm of the Century" hit the eastern seaboard.  It was only a matter of time before someone tried to bring this story to the big screen.  Thankfully, it was Wolfgang Petersen who did so - here he does for fishing what he did for submarine warfare in "Das Boot" - puts the viewer in the midst of the action and scares the hell out of them.\n\nI can say without exaggeration that I have never experienced a movie as stressful as this one (the friend I brought to the premiere was literally ill).  The movie starts out slowly and deliberately, gradually setting the stage for what is about to come.  Petersen utilizes several subplots to build the suspense: initially he focuses on the disappointment of the crew as they repeatedly fail to hit the motherlode.

However, special effects alone do not adequately convey the appropriate sense of danger.\n\nMany of the water scenes were actually shot in heavy seas - they managed to film in the tail end of a hurricane - adding to the realism (several members of the crew were regularly feeding the fish...). The actors faced additional dangers - Mark Wahlberg came perilously close to drowning, not once but twice, and was injured by one of the animatronic creatures.   Anyone expecting Clooney or Wahlberg to be glamorous will be sorely disappointed - they are earthy, and scraggly.  But more importantly, their performances ring true.  Indeed, all of the main characters deliver subtle, believable performances.\n\nI have never given a strong endorsement with an equally strong caveat - you must see this movie, but only if you can handle stress.

But know know what? This was actually a good remake.\n\nWhile the movie is very similar to the original, they did make some small changes here and there, mainly in the characters background and their motivation - which might help explain some things that seemed a bit odd in the original (for example, why would a beautiful blonde marry a geek). Others may claim the writer ruined some ideas.\n\nIt's hard and unfair to compare the actors' performance to Dustin Hoffman and David Warner in the original, but I have to say that all the cast actually did a decent job. James Woods was excellent as a southern redneck and Kate Bosworth was surprisingly good too. I'm not familiar with any of the other actors, who were all decent in their roles.\n\nThe ending had some small changes too - again, made in order for the characters to have a better motivation. Still, I prefer the ending of the original, which I recall was more intense and more "surreal", made to show a man protecting his "castle".\n\nAll in all, this remake is much better than many of the recent remakes I've seen (or chose to skip). Was this remake necessary? Probably not.\n\n5/10 Worth watching","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33631,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-09-16","keywords":"rape,sexual humiliation,rape victim,gang rape,panties pulled down","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi174103833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyNzU4MDI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI5MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyNzU4MDI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI5MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"L.A. screenwriter David Sumner relocates with his wife to her hometown in the deep South.

But know know what? This was actually a good remake.\n\nWhile the movie is very similar to the original, they did make some small changes here and there, mainly in the characters background and their motivation - which might help explain some things that seemed a bit odd in the original (for example, why would a beautiful blonde marry a geek). Others may claim the writer ruined some ideas.\n\nIt's hard and unfair to compare the actors' performance to Dustin Hoffman and David Warner in the original, but I have to say that all the cast actually did a decent job. James Woods was excellent as a southern redneck and Kate Bosworth was surprisingly good too. I'm not familiar with any of the other actors, who were all decent in their roles.\n\nThe ending had some small changes too - again, made in order for the characters to have a better motivation. Still, I prefer the ending of the original, which I recall was more intense and more "surreal", made to show a man protecting his "castle".\n\nAll in all, this remake is much better than many of the recent remakes I've seen (or chose to skip). Was this remake necessary? Probably not.\n\n5/10 Worth watching","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33631,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-09-16","keywords":"rape,sexual humiliation,rape victim,gang rape,panties pulled down","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi174103833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyNzU4MDI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI5MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyNzU4MDI4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDI5MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"L.A. screenwriter David Sumner relocates with his wife to her hometown in the deep South.

A large stash of confiscated heroin has been un-confiscated right from police headquarters, and both the heroin and the perpetrator must be found within four days, or Internal Affairs is going to take some big-time disciplinary action.  Lowry and Burnett are called in because they were the ones who captured the heroin in the first place, and because of the one trait they share -- a renegade approach to police work, which may not have their boss's approval, but which does get the job done (and at one point, causes a store owner to think they're out to rob him).  The various twists and turns of the investigation lead to Lowry getting knocked out of commission at the same time that Julie witnesses a murder and refuses to deal with anybody but Mike Lowry.  But Marcus Burnett is the only one available to deal with her, and since waiting for Lowry to recover isn't an option   \n\nSubsequent events include Lowry's bachelor pad being invaded by Julie and her dogs, while Lowry stays with Burnett's wife, Burnett trying to keep his wife from finding out what's really going on, and Burnett and Lowry trying to find the heroin and keep Julie alive. \n\nFor all you action movie fans, plenty of cars, plenty of buildings, and plenty of people get blown up along the way.

In ARMAGEDDON, I felt the stakes were high enough that humor didn't seem appropriate.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":250065,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1995-04-07","keywords":"miami florida,buddy movie,criminal investigation,murder investigation,usa","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bad Boys","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2344091929","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExNzlmNDgtYTI4NC00OTg3LTk3MTgtZTI4YzkxNjY1NDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExNzlmNDgtYTI4NC00OTg3LTk3MTgtZTI4YzkxNjY1NDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001454/","name":"Martin Lawrence","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102288/","name":"Lisa Boyle"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000881/","name":"Michael Bay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102770/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0303032/","name":"George Gallo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057398/","name":"Michael Barrie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0611848/","name":"Jim Mulholland"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

We have seen an influx of Alien takeovers recently and it is getting a bit stale I must admit. Don't get me wrong, I love films about ET's taking over, but Hollywood has beaten that horse to death. "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" is a welcome change to this trend pitting us measly humans against our closest ancestors, Great Apes. Directed by Rupert Wyatt ("The Escapist") and supported by the unbelievable WETA Digital ("King Kong", "Lord of the Rings", "Avatar") for special effects. "Apes" is a wonder of motion capture, an intelligent heart felt script with great direction. Unfortunately, the human actors left a lot to be desired. But this film isn't about the humans, it's all about the Simians.\n\nAs plots go, this is pretty basic. James Franco plays Will Rodman, a brilliant scientist with a breakthrough drug that just may cure Alzheimer's. Rodman and his team are using chimpanzee's to test this new drug and in the process find out that it increases intelligence as well as repair cells in the brain. One of the test subjects gets loose in an intense sequence and ultimately put down. It turns out that she had just given birth to a beautiful baby chimp who inherited this new "altered" gene. Rodman decides the only moral thing to do is to take the baby home while a co-worker tries to find a sanctuary but once Rodman finds out that this little ball of fur has the intelligence of a human child twice it's age he decides to keep and raise the chimp as a child. It's only a matter of time that our chimp Caesar figures out he is not like the other children in the neighborhood. Rodman is forced to give up Caesar to an "Ape Sanctuary" and there begins some of the most exhilarating revolutionary action I've ever seen.\n\nTechnically, this film is massive. The work WETA Digital did with motion capture (mo-cap) is truly a wonder to behold. Visual Effects Supervisor with WETA Digital Joe Letteri stated that they built on the technology used in "Avatar" to produce the most realistic and accurate portrayal of the actors suited to play the Simians. Andy Serkis (Gollum from "Lord of the Rings" and Kong from "King Kong") plays chimp Caesar. Serkis manages to fool all of us into believing he is a real animal with super intelligence. His facial emotions and mannerisms should most certainly nominate him for an Oscar. There is a real connection that the audience feels with Caesar and it is all thanks to Serkis' work. Without such an experienced mo-cap actor, this film would not have been such a success.\n\nNot only is the technology used to create the revolution amazing, the action is top notch as well. Many times I found myself with my jaw on the floor from the intense sequences put to screen. Everything from a simple terrifying look from an angry ape to the full out battle on the Golden Gate Bridge was pulled off without a hitch. Many points to the pacing of the films action as it could have been the crutch that killed this beast of a film. One of the most amazing scenes in my opinion is when a group of apes are fleeing over top a suburban neighborhood through the trees. While this is going on we see some people on the street while leaves upon leaves are falling to the ground. This level of detail is apparent in every shot, brilliant work by the production team.\n\nMy only problems with this film is the acting from Franco and Freida Pinto, who plays the love interest. They both seemed to "phone it in" as it were. They were not overly impressive and just seemed stale. Maybe the director wanted them to tone it down so that Serkis would have more of an impact acting as a voiceless chimp. Either way, as I said in the beginning, this film wasn't about the humans. It's about compassion, freedom and understanding and on those levels the film is a grand success.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":508228,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-08-05","keywords":"ape,chimpanzee,planet of the apes,alzheimer's disease,when animals attack","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1615502617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Trailer #2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012501/","name":"Rupert Wyatt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415425/","name":"Rick Jaffa"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798646/","name":"Amanda Silver"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0099541/","name":"Pierre Boulle"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's about compassion, freedom and understanding and on those levels the film is a grand success.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":508228,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-08-05","keywords":"ape,chimpanzee,planet of the apes,alzheimer's disease,when animals attack","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1615502617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Trailer #2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012501/","name":"Rupert Wyatt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415425/","name":"Rick Jaffa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798646/","name":"Amanda Silver","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0099541/","name":"Pierre Boulle"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The success is attributable partly to the comedic talents of Will Smith and Martin Lawrence -- who have the ability to deliver crude, rude dialog such that it's funny nevertheless -- and partly to a story that combines suspense and humor into a believable whole. \n\n Our two heroes are police detectives Mike Lowry (Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Lawrence), who are a kind of tough-cop variation on The Odd Couple . Lowry is suave, slick, self-controlled, well-to-do, heroic, and a real ladies man.  Burnett, on the other hand, is an ordinary guy who manages to stumble reasonably effectively, if somewhat ineptly, through his work and his married life.\n\nSo imagine what happens when Burnett has to convince a key witness, Julie (Téa Leoni) that he's Mike Lowry -- not just for a few hours, but for a few days.  Furthermore, this is no pre-planned, well-orchestrated masquerade.  A large stash of confiscated heroin has been un-confiscated right from police headquarters, and both the heroin and the perpetrator must be found within four days, or Internal Affairs is going to take some big-time disciplinary action.  Lowry and Burnett are called in because they were the ones who captured the heroin in the first place, and because of the one trait they share -- a renegade approach to police work, which may not have their boss's approval, but which does get the job done (and at one point, causes a store owner to think they're out to rob him).  The various twists and turns of the investigation lead to Lowry getting knocked out of commission at the same time that Julie witnesses a murder and refuses to deal with anybody but Mike Lowry.  But Marcus Burnett is the only one available to deal with her, and since waiting for Lowry to recover isn't an option   \n\nSubsequent events include Lowry's bachelor pad being invaded by Julie and her dogs, while Lowry stays with Burnett's wife, Burnett trying to keep his wife from finding out what's really going on, and Burnett and Lowry trying to find the heroin and keep Julie alive. \n\nFor all you action movie fans, plenty of cars, plenty of buildings, and plenty of people get blown up along the way.  (Looking over this review, I see that I've belied the high level of violence, which I definitely should warn you against.)\n\nBAD BOYS kept me both amused and on the edge of my seat throughout.  I'm afraid I did have two small complaints, however.  First, I wish the resolution of the Burnett-pretending-to-be-Lowry  story had been timed to coincide with the resolution of the main plot. \n\nAs it is, the comic subplot ends, leaving the rest of the movie to proceed in a rather formulaic and pedantic fashion.  Second, I wish more time had been spent on Lowry's problem of stepping into Burnett's shoes.  The swinging bachelor having to play family man would have been good for a few laughs that we never got.\n\nAside from that, however, this is an action movie that stands out among the rest.\n\nOne final note concerning the DVD "Special Edition" release.  BAD BOYS was a movie in which the music was particularly effective, and the DVD actually lets you listen to the music track by itself.  I wish DVDs of other movies with great music had this option.\n\n* Three examples that come to mind are 48 HOURS, KINDERGARTEN COP, and another Michael Bay film, ARMAGEDDON.  48 HOURS was grim enough to seriously stifle the humor, even with Eddie Murphy in the lead role.

You must need to be a patience, besides it is a dark comedy. You might wonder why the title was named 'Demolition', the films gives a strange demonstration for that in a good way. It is not like a must see, but totally worth for Gyllenhaal alone.

Going to a film with the two of them and you know there is going to be blood, violence, killing, action, noise, and an eventual winner. If this is not your cup of tea, go see The Nanny Diaries and leave this to the fan boys.\n\nThis is not their first film together. They both appeared in The One six years ago. This time they are the leads and on opposing sides - Statham an FBI agent and Li a contract killer. The action takes place in the middle of a Yakuza war in San Francisco.\n\nFans of Jet Li will not be disappointed. he still has all the moves even if he is 47; however, he does rely more on swords and guns, and other weapons in this film. Statham is Li's equal and gives as good as he gets. The story has an interesting twist which i will not give a clue on as it is a major plot point.\n\nInteresting entertainment by girls in cages at the Yakuza club. I thought that went out in the 60s, but it was a nice diversion.\n\nThis film is red meat. It has no pretensions of quality and dialog is minimal, which goes along with the story. If you are a fan, you will be entertained. If you are not, why are you there?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88706,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-11-14","keywords":"box,chinese mafia,kissing,foreplay,sex scene","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"War","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3934650905","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNkMjEwNWQtNDFkNy00MzAwLWJlOTUtN2I5YmYyZTQ4YWU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNkMjEwNWQtNDFkNy00MzAwLWJlOTUtN2I5YmYyZTQ4YWU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this action film starring Jet Li"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001472/","name":"Jet Li"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1229204/","name":"Nadine Velazquez"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041161/","name":"Philip G.

Going to a film with the two of them and you know there is going to be blood, violence, killing, action, noise, and an eventual winner. If this is not your cup of tea, go see The Nanny Diaries and leave this to the fan boys.\n\nThis is not their first film together. They both appeared in The One six years ago. This time they are the leads and on opposing sides - Statham an FBI agent and Li a contract killer. The action takes place in the middle of a Yakuza war in San Francisco.\n\nFans of Jet Li will not be disappointed. he still has all the moves even if he is 47; however, he does rely more on swords and guns, and other weapons in this film. Statham is Li's equal and gives as good as he gets. The story has an interesting twist which i will not give a clue on as it is a major plot point.\n\nInteresting entertainment by girls in cages at the Yakuza club. I thought that went out in the 60s, but it was a nice diversion.\n\nThis film is red meat. It has no pretensions of quality and dialog is minimal, which goes along with the story. If you are a fan, you will be entertained. If you are not, why are you there?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88706,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-11-14","keywords":"box,chinese mafia,kissing,foreplay,sex scene","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"War","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3934650905","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNkMjEwNWQtNDFkNy00MzAwLWJlOTUtN2I5YmYyZTQ4YWU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNkMjEwNWQtNDFkNy00MzAwLWJlOTUtN2I5YmYyZTQ4YWU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this action film starring Jet Li","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001472/","name":"Jet Li","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005458/","name":"Jason Statham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1229204/","name":"Nadine Velazquez"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041161/","name":"Philip G.

In order for the movie to work for me, it had to capture Bridget's plucky-heroine character and the hilarious-poignant emotions that are in the book.  Needless to say, `Bridget Jones's Diary' the movie worked very, very, very well.  Although Helen Fielding also wrote the screenplay (w/ Richard Curtis, very skilled with romantic comedies) and keeps the laughs coming, this movie could have fallen flat on its face.  But it doesn't because one, the casting is absolutely divine and two, smartly builds on some elements the book downplays.  \n\n\t Renee Zellweger is absolutely perfect as Bridget Jones.  She has always been one of my favorite actresses and here, she totally displays Bridget's pathetic cuteness.  Zellweger gained weight for this role, too, so she looks adorably plump.  It's very, very hard to not fall in love with her the moment you see her at her family's Christmas party or drinking alone at home or listening to sad, Celine Dion music.  (You have a heart of stone if you aren't moved to laughs or tears or pity for her.)  I can't imagine anyone else playing Bridget Jones.  Zellweger fits the role because she is very much normal and approachable we can relate to her.  \n\nAs Daniel Cleaver (her caddish Cassanova lover/boss), Hugh Grant is smoldering and hilarious.  (Ok, I might be a little biased because I've been in love with him for ages and ages, but you can't deny he is a great comedic actor.)  There's no trace of his stuttering that we saw (and I loved) in `Four Weddings and a Funeral' or `Sense and Sensibility.'  Grant morphs effortlessly into a cad that we all love to hate and all love to love.  Yes, it's a paradox, but that is what Grant brings to his role.  He makes being `bad' look so sexy.  You can't take your eyes off him; he brings his own humor to his role.  It's lovely, smoldering, and incredibly sexy. \n\n Colin Firth is also a delight to watch onscreen as Mark Darcy (I think I might be in love with him, too).  He is also sexy and smoldering, but not in the same wild, fiery way as Daniel Cleaver.  Firth brings a very cute sweetness to his role.  I don't know if it is his adorable face or his hair or the way he dresses or just the fact that he is a major sex symbol, but you can't help but fall in love with him the MOMENT you see him onscreen. There is also one very beautiful moment where he tells Bridget, `I like you very much just the way you are.'  It's incredibly romantic and, for me, ranks right up there with Tom Cruise's `You complete me' in `Jerry Maguire.' He also has rather explosive chemistry with Renee Zellweger, which is moving and sexy all at the same time.  (And, of course, the author Helen Fielding used Colin Firth as the basis for Mark Darcy, so it all works out marvelously.) \t\n\nI also mentioned that the movie smartly builds on some elements that the book downplays.  Yes, there are certain parts of the movie that cannot be found in the book, but I'm still glad they put them in the movie.  Most of what they added doesn't necessarily build on plot but it does add to the characters.  I don't want to give anything away because it's rather hilarious what unfolds onscreen.  The movie is filmed in an almost Ally McBeal type of way but it remains true to the sincerity, cuteness, and pathetic naivete that Bridget Jones embodies.  There are no pretensions. It's an entirely wonderful film.   10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":233781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-10","keywords":"unfaithfulness,employer employee relationship,opposites attract,love triangle,book publishing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridget Jones's Diary","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi192783897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg4ZGY2MWItNTJlYy00YTE1LTg2ZTAtZGIyNDEzYWYzZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjg4ZGY2MWItNTJlYy00YTE1LTg2ZTAtZGIyNDEzYWYzZjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bridget Jones's Diary"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536632/","name":"Sharon Maguire"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276144/","name":"Helen Fielding"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0203577/","name":"Andrew Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Even though he might not know why, Mark positively adores Bridget. Colin gets that and twinkles, melts and warms in all the right places. Same goes for Daniel he's drawn to his Bridge for some inexplicable reason. Hugh Grant really ought to be looking for a patent for that mojo he works so well. All of the original actors are back as Bridget's parents and her "dating war command" of pals and all have a natural, easy chemistry that works. But, the negatives, they are a-plenty.\n\nBiggest problem here was the complete tone change. In the first film, we were on the ride with Bridget...seeing things through her eyes, groaning as she put her foot in her mouth again and cheering for her to finally get it right. However, in this movie, it feels like someone stuck her up on a stage and spent 2 hours throwing pies and tomatoes at her cause it seemed real cool. She's not in on the joke here, she IS the joke. Her few extra pounds are no longer just a part of the package  they are the end-all of her worth as a person. It feels like the folks behind this film don't even LIKE the character  they just think it's real cool to humiliate her as often as possible. It doesn't even look like they bothered to send Renee to makeup or wardrobe  she (as Bridget) was pleasantly plump in the first film, but never dowdy. The character is downright frumpy in this movie with a perpetual case of bed head and clothes that look like castoffs from Mayberry. And Renee plays into it with her acting choices  Bridget was frazzled in the first movie but still retained her dignity most of the time. She's a perpetual victim in this one, though, and even though Renee is still cute as a button and incredibly endearing, some of Bridget's spark is gone.\n\nWhat happens after the happy ending? Couple realizes that they are each real, flawed people. And the movie makes it seem like Mark is at that point  never tries to change Bridget, never gets angry and her constant mishaps amuse more than annoy. But, as each of Bridget's tantrums unfolded, I kept asking myself why in the WORLD the man was still there. Bridget's keen on him but doesn't trust him. She likes to be with him but is suspicious of his actions without any real cause. Now, we know she's an insecure character and feels like she's not classy enough to fit into his world. And if the movie built from that, maybe we'd have a different story. But the obstacles they face are external. The characters never make decisions on their own  something or someone else makes them feel a certain way or forces them into a course of action that decides what will happen next. And Bridget's reactions almost make it seem like somehow, over the course of the last 'six weeks', she's regressed to a girl in the schoolyard stomping her feet when her boyfriend does something she doesn't like.\n\nAnother problem  the utter lack of subtlety. Why include one fat joke when 3 or 4 plus a butt shot can fit into the scene? Why spend most of the movie dropping hints about a reveal when you can beat the audience over the head with it in one of the final scenes? Why have Daniel make one joke about stealing Mark's wife when he can drop another one 30 minutes later? Oh look, matching Christmas jumpers  how cute. Most of the funny in this movie comes from certain 'episodes' as opposed to the dialogue. I loved the ski trip and Bridget's 'magic mushrooms' in Thailand. But, when the characters are actually talking to each other, they just aren't that funny. Most of the jokes are reruns from the first movie that feel stale. The naughty jokes are kicked up a notch but everyone in my packed theater, including me, either grimaced or sat stone-faced through most of them. Note to filmmakers: dirty has to actually BE funny to be funny.\n\nThis feels like a movie about a woman made by men who think wet clothes, girl-on-girl action and butt close-ups get it done. I read some interviews that said that Renee would only do a second film if it took care of Bridget and held up the standards of the first. I almost wonder if someone slid her this script on the first day of shooting as a rewrite once she'd already signed on the dotted line. This felt like a bleached, harsher version of the first the warmth is gone. I know there was a different director and I really don't think the new kid gets why Bridget was/is such a phenomenon. As much as I was looking forward to this film, I wish they'd never done it.\n\nOh, and also, as a P.S.  if I was a Thai woman right now, I'd be suing Working Title and Miramax for defamation of character for their version of 'Fun with Stereotypes'."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110186,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-12-29","keywords":"thailand,marriage proposal,prison,boyfriend girlfriend relationship,opposites attract","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1468053017","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM4MjQzMDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM4MjQzMDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452319/","name":"Beeban Kidron"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276144/","name":"Helen Fielding"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0203577/","name":"Andrew Davies"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And Bridget's reactions almost make it seem like somehow, over the course of the last 'six weeks', she's regressed to a girl in the schoolyard stomping her feet when her boyfriend does something she doesn't like.\n\nAnother problem  the utter lack of subtlety. Why include one fat joke when 3 or 4 plus a butt shot can fit into the scene? Why spend most of the movie dropping hints about a reveal when you can beat the audience over the head with it in one of the final scenes? Why have Daniel make one joke about stealing Mark's wife when he can drop another one 30 minutes later? Oh look, matching Christmas jumpers  how cute. Most of the funny in this movie comes from certain 'episodes' as opposed to the dialogue. I loved the ski trip and Bridget's 'magic mushrooms' in Thailand. But, when the characters are actually talking to each other, they just aren't that funny. Most of the jokes are reruns from the first movie that feel stale. The naughty jokes are kicked up a notch but everyone in my packed theater, including me, either grimaced or sat stone-faced through most of them. Note to filmmakers: dirty has to actually BE funny to be funny.\n\nThis feels like a movie about a woman made by men who think wet clothes, girl-on-girl action and butt close-ups get it done. I read some interviews that said that Renee would only do a second film if it took care of Bridget and held up the standards of the first. I almost wonder if someone slid her this script on the first day of shooting as a rewrite once she'd already signed on the dotted line. This felt like a bleached, harsher version of the first the warmth is gone. I know there was a different director and I really don't think the new kid gets why Bridget was/is such a phenomenon. As much as I was looking forward to this film, I wish they'd never done it.\n\nOh, and also, as a P.S.  if I was a Thai woman right now, I'd be suing Working Title and Miramax for defamation of character for their version of 'Fun with Stereotypes'.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110186,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-12-29","keywords":"thailand,marriage proposal,prison,boyfriend girlfriend relationship,opposites attract","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1468053017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM4MjQzMDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTM4MjQzMDk4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM5MzkxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bridget Jones: Edge of Reason","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000424/","name":"Hugh Grant"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452319/","name":"Beeban Kidron"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276144/","name":"Helen Fielding","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0203577/","name":"Andrew Davies","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0193485/","name":"Richard Curtis"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is the first movie I ever recall watching. My grandpa has his own Tractor-Trailer and I always went with him on road trips, so I instantly fell in love with this movie when I saw the truck. Even though it's an old, beaten up, disgusting truck, I would have to say it looks pretty sweet. Lincoln Hawk, played by Sylvester Stallone, is a independent trucker just trying to put his life back together. He realized he made mistakes, and tries to reconcile with his son that he abandoned years earlier. When the boy's grandfather offers Hawk the offer of a life time, and Hawk refuses....it's very clear to him, that he has no other choice but to win, and the determination really shows.

Even though it's an old, beaten up, disgusting truck, I would have to say it looks pretty sweet. Lincoln Hawk, played by Sylvester Stallone, is a independent trucker just trying to put his life back together. He realized he made mistakes, and tries to reconcile with his son that he abandoned years earlier. When the boy's grandfather offers Hawk the offer of a life time, and Hawk refuses....it's very clear to him, that he has no other choice but to win, and the determination really shows. Sly acts a bit uninterested in this movie...you can see it in his eyes. Every now and then you can catch his wandering off and not paying attention.

This is a film worth watching but if you are expecting the next Gladiator, I suggest waiting for the director's cut on DVD/ Blu-ray.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":259681,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-05-12","keywords":"archer,robin hood character,england,1190s,king of england","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robin Hood: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi73860121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3ODEzMjMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU4MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3ODEzMjMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU4MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of an archer in the army of Richard Coeur de Lion who fights against the Norman invaders and becomes the legendary hero known as Robin Hood.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532193/","name":"Matthew Macfadyen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0717550/","name":"Ethan Reiff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0903456/","name":"Cyrus Voris"],"duration":"PT2H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A down on his luck cop who kicks ass as hard as he hits the bottle.\n\nBruce stars as Tom Hardy, a Pittsburgh city cop who gets busted down to working on a police pursuit boat as he testified against his partner. His ex girlfriends keep getting murdered and dumped in the river - he knows that someone is doing this to frame him but who? This movie has an excellent car chase and some cool lines from Bruce plus some very good set piece action scenes. There are also some very good supporting performances from Tom Sizemore and a very crazy Robert Pastorelli.\n\nI picked this up on DVD from ebay and was surprised by how good it looked on a large widescreen TV - I was only a kid when this was released so never saw it at the cinema. Good cinematography of the rushing river and the bridge.

A down on his luck cop who kicks ass as hard as he hits the bottle.\n\nBruce stars as Tom Hardy, a Pittsburgh city cop who gets busted down to working on a police pursuit boat as he testified against his partner. His ex girlfriends keep getting murdered and dumped in the river - he knows that someone is doing this to frame him but who? This movie has an excellent car chase and some cool lines from Bruce plus some very good set piece action scenes. There are also some very good supporting performances from Tom Sizemore and a very crazy Robert Pastorelli.\n\nI picked this up on DVD from ebay and was surprised by how good it looked on a large widescreen TV - I was only a kid when this was released so never saw it at the cinema. Good cinematography of the rushing river and the bridge. Definitely worth checking out.\n\n"Who's the best cop now Jimmy??"","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41376,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1993-09-17","keywords":"serial killer,river,pittsburgh pennsylvania,grudge,uncle nephew relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Striking Distance","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3464888601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjFlNmY5MzMtZjZlMC00MmQzLThiODYtYjA0ODcxMWQ3YTZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjFlNmY5MzMtZjZlMC00MmQzLThiODYtYjA0ODcxMWQ3YTZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001199/","name":"Dennis Farina"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0380705/","name":"Rowdy Herrington"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183651/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0380705/","name":"Rowdy Herrington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0438320/","name":"Marty Kaplan"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Hail stones the size of footballs decimate cities, typhoons destroy Los Angeles and New York becomes flooded. As the big freeze crosses the northern hemisphere, a small group of survivors try to fend off the cold as the world prepares for a dramatic change in the world order.\n\nThis film may be a modern blockbuster but in almost everyway it is a 1970's disaster movie where an event happens after some build up and we then spend the rest of the film watching the survivors trying to, well, survive. In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. For this reason the first hour is great  it has dramatic pace, is involving and looks fantastic even if we have seen it before in different variations (how many times has New York been destroyed now?). However after the sheer global terror is pretty much finished we suddenly become much more small scale and the film looses much of it's impact and it's pace. After the initial danger has passed the film uses illogical and silly plot devices to put the survivors at risk  a cold eye of a storm, blood infections, creeping ice and wolves are among the problems. While this is OK on a genre level it doesn't compare to the first hour and it gets a little dull and plodding at times.\n\nThe clichés are all present and correct: the politicians, the upright scientists, the sacrifice, the daring rescues and so on. It's fair to say that if you are looking for more than a basic script then you will be looking in the wrong place here. All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action  if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. The film tries to deliver an environmental message but in a way this film will not help the environmental movement because it is too exaggerated to be taken seriously (like the idea of Celtic and Man Utd reaching the Champions League final  during this season? Please!), however it does include several surprisingly barbed attacks on the US administration (could the VP look any more like Cheney?). Just a shame that the film message is delivered with all the subtlety that Segal showed when he did something similar in his environmental action film On Deadly Ground.\n\nThe script doesn't really create characters either and it means we don't care that much about what happens to them in the final hour (countless millions are dead for goodness sake!). The dialogue in the first hour is nicely gruff and scientific and very genre but the second hour is more human and the lines aren't suited for that  not even in the hands of an impressive number of good actors. I like Quaid and he is a good lead here, he gets the good scientific stuff and only is lumbered with the rather silly notion of walking to New York from Washington. Gyllenhaal must have upset legions of cult fan boys by appearing in a big budget movie but he does OK with the role (despite looking too old to be in school). The rest of the cast are fairly mixed but, as with the genre, they are just filled even if some are good. Welsh is good even if he was cast for his similarity to Dick Cheney, Holm adds a small bit of dignity in his role as well as being supported by the very fine actor Lester in a minor role. Faces like Sanders, Mihok and a few others don't really matter as they are merely victims waiting for their turn to be used for dramatic effect.\n\nOverall the first hour of this film is good on a blockbuster level, but it blows it's wad too early (don't ya hate it when that happens?!) and is left with a second hour that is right out of the 1970's with all the weaknesses that that entails. Generally I enjoyed the film because I was just expecting a big noisy movie to pass a few hours  bad script, no characters and lots of clichés? Why would I be surprised by that? It's par for the course and you should not watch this if you know these aspects will annoy you. As it is, it's an average film but one that is noisy and spectacular enough to pass muster in the summer blockbuster stakes."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":428618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-05-26","keywords":"global warming,end of the world,climate crisis,climate,weather","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Day After Tomorrow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3008019993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljZjVhMGMtYjM3ZS00YWFmLWE2NjAtMjJjYjRkMmMxNjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljZjVhMGMtYjM3ZS00YWFmLWE2NjAtMjJjYjRkMmMxNjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002536/","name":"Emmy Rossum"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060306/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0618680/","name":"Jeffrey Nachmanoff"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As it is, it's an average film but one that is noisy and spectacular enough to pass muster in the summer blockbuster stakes.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":428618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-05-26","keywords":"global warming,end of the world,climate crisis,climate,weather","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Day After Tomorrow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3008019993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljZjVhMGMtYjM3ZS00YWFmLWE2NjAtMjJjYjRkMmMxNjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljZjVhMGMtYjM3ZS00YWFmLWE2NjAtMjJjYjRkMmMxNjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002536/","name":"Emmy Rossum"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060306/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0618680/","name":"Jeffrey Nachmanoff"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Hail stones the size of footballs decimate cities, typhoons destroy Los Angeles and New York becomes flooded. As the big freeze crosses the northern hemisphere, a small group of survivors try to fend off the cold as the world prepares for a dramatic change in the world order.\n\nThis film may be a modern blockbuster but in almost everyway it is a 1970's disaster movie where an event happens after some build up and we then spend the rest of the film watching the survivors trying to, well, survive. In that regard the film carries all the usual problems that the genre carries but happily benefits from the fact that the effects are much better than 1970's movies could manage. For this reason the first hour is great  it has dramatic pace, is involving and looks fantastic even if we have seen it before in different variations (how many times has New York been destroyed now?). However after the sheer global terror is pretty much finished we suddenly become much more small scale and the film looses much of it's impact and it's pace. After the initial danger has passed the film uses illogical and silly plot devices to put the survivors at risk  a cold eye of a storm, blood infections, creeping ice and wolves are among the problems. While this is OK on a genre level it doesn't compare to the first hour and it gets a little dull and plodding at times.\n\nThe clichés are all present and correct: the politicians, the upright scientists, the sacrifice, the daring rescues and so on. It's fair to say that if you are looking for more than a basic script then you will be looking in the wrong place here. All this film does is to provide spectacle and moments of dramatic action  if you want to think about it then you will only hurt your enjoyment of the action. The film tries to deliver an environmental message but in a way this film will not help the environmental movement because it is too exaggerated to be taken seriously (like the idea of Celtic and Man Utd reaching the Champions League final  during this season? Please!), however it does include several surprisingly barbed attacks on the US administration (could the VP look any more like Cheney?). Just a shame that the film message is delivered with all the subtlety that Segal showed when he did something similar in his environmental action film On Deadly Ground.\n\nThe script doesn't really create characters either and it means we don't care that much about what happens to them in the final hour (countless millions are dead for goodness sake!). The dialogue in the first hour is nicely gruff and scientific and very genre but the second hour is more human and the lines aren't suited for that  not even in the hands of an impressive number of good actors. I like Quaid and he is a good lead here, he gets the good scientific stuff and only is lumbered with the rather silly notion of walking to New York from Washington. Gyllenhaal must have upset legions of cult fan boys by appearing in a big budget movie but he does OK with the role (despite looking too old to be in school). The rest of the cast are fairly mixed but, as with the genre, they are just filled even if some are good. Welsh is good even if he was cast for his similarity to Dick Cheney, Holm adds a small bit of dignity in his role as well as being supported by the very fine actor Lester in a minor role. Faces like Sanders, Mihok and a few others don't really matter as they are merely victims waiting for their turn to be used for dramatic effect.\n\nOverall the first hour of this film is good on a blockbuster level, but it blows it's wad too early (don't ya hate it when that happens?!) and is left with a second hour that is right out of the 1970's with all the weaknesses that that entails. Generally I enjoyed the film because I was just expecting a big noisy movie to pass a few hours  bad script, no characters and lots of clichés? Why would I be surprised by that? It's par for the course and you should not watch this if you know these aspects will annoy you. As it is, it's an average film but one that is noisy and spectacular enough to pass muster in the summer blockbuster stakes."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":428618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-05-26","keywords":"global warming,end of the world,climate crisis,climate,weather","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Day After Tomorrow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3008019993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljZjVhMGMtYjM3ZS00YWFmLWE2NjAtMjJjYjRkMmMxNjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjljZjVhMGMtYjM3ZS00YWFmLWE2NjAtMjJjYjRkMmMxNjdiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002536/","name":"Emmy Rossum"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060306/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0618680/","name":"Jeffrey Nachmanoff"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I am a huge fan of the His Dark Materials books, and was reading all three in preparation for the movie to come, I was praying this would be the new fantasy epic to watch. I suppose I got myself way too hyped for this movie, even the slightly negative reviews didn't stop me from being excited, so what a shame to say this cannot help but be a disappointment for me. I have a few major problems with this mainly, mainly I suppose because of the changes from the book, in fact had I have not read the book I most probably would have completely adored the movie rather than have just liked it. The Golden Compass is not a bad movie, its definitely better than the first Narnia movie and Harry Potter movie, but after reading the book I couldn't help but criticise because I know how amazing this movie could have been. Thankfuly the entire cast, yes the entire cast, are absolutely perfect, there are two notable set pieces and the storyline still keeps its grip on the audience despite being rushed. The lack of the ending from the book actually didn't even bother me that much, so long as people who have read the book are aware its going to be in the second movie then I believe that they won't be that bothered. Overall Golden Compass is an entertaining two hours, that could benefit from another half hour. Its a great film to watch for Christmas and will hopefully do well at the box office so the Subtle Knife is made very soon.\n\nThe biggest surprise of the cast definitely comes from Dakota Blue Richards as the lead, Lyra. In the trailers I actually thought that Lyra looked terrible, her voice sounded monotone and the girl showed no expression. Thankfuly in the movie that is far from the truth. Richards pulls off the character of Lyra perfectly, she's cheeky, at times rude but alway likable and definitely well acted. Her cockney accent surprisingly works and never gets too irritating, although at first it takes some adjusting too, and her emotions throughout the film are very well displayed. She carries the entire movie very well and it will be great to see her return in the future films as I know how much dramatic stuff she will have to do. But its Nicole Kidman who practically runs over the hills with this movie. Mrs Coulter was always my favourite character in the movie, and Kidman delivers an icy turn as the villainess. Kidman makes her multi-layered and highly memorable, her best scenes definitely being towards the end. Daniel Craig unfortunately features very little, but he delivers a great performance. Eva Green is superb as Serafine Pekkala but once again features way too little for my liking. The other two superb characters, and my joint second favourite performances, come from Ian Mckellen doing the voice of Iorek, and Sam Eliott who is perfectly cast as Lee Scoresby.\n\nHowever despite the incredible performances its the cruel way things have been changed or cut that made me incapable of ever giving this higher than a 7/10. I will never understand to this day why the polar bear fight was changed from near the end to the middle, and why the Bolvangar scenes are so unnecessarily rushed its almost cruel. Also changing certain characters and changing certain facts just infuriated me all the more! But the ultimate problem with the movie is the fact it is way too rushed. Occasionally it is a blessing to get a two hour movie rather than a bloated two and a half hour once, but this story requires all the time it can get, and with events just taking up mere seconds and events being cut out (fans of the book will hate The Cocktail Party not being in the film) makes the film feel too short and missing something. Thankfuly the bear fight is as incredible as I hoped for, it ends in very cool way, and the final battle at Bolvangar, while way too short is definitely well done. The movie also packs an emotional punch at times, the intercision scenes are pitch perfect and the ending is amazing in my eyes in terms of emotion. The effects of the daemons are very well done, and the daemons themselves are pretty cool, most namely Mrs Coulter's golden monkey which will terrify kids for a while.\n\nThe Golden Compass is hardly the new Lord of the Rings as many, including me admittedly, had hoped for, but thankfully it looks much more promising than the Narnia series and perhaps with a new director, and less editing, this series could really take off. But for now I just need to get over my slight disappointment of it. Still very much worth watching though.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183240,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-05-14","keywords":"orphan,parallel universe,quest,missing child,kidnapping","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Golden Compass","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2813395225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNTQ1NzgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTIxODAz._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNTQ1NzgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTIxODAz._V1_.jpg","description":"The Golden Compass - Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0185819/","name":"Daniel Craig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2301950/","name":"Dakota Blue Richards"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919363/","name":"Chris Weitz"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136728/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012870/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919363/","name":"Chris Weitz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1099514/","name":"Philip Pullman"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I am a huge fan of the His Dark Materials books, and was reading all three in preparation for the movie to come, I was praying this would be the new fantasy epic to watch. I suppose I got myself way too hyped for this movie, even the slightly negative reviews didn't stop me from being excited, so what a shame to say this cannot help but be a disappointment for me. I have a few major problems with this mainly, mainly I suppose because of the changes from the book, in fact had I have not read the book I most probably would have completely adored the movie rather than have just liked it. The Golden Compass is not a bad movie, its definitely better than the first Narnia movie and Harry Potter movie, but after reading the book I couldn't help but criticise because I know how amazing this movie could have been. Thankfuly the entire cast, yes the entire cast, are absolutely perfect, there are two notable set pieces and the storyline still keeps its grip on the audience despite being rushed. The lack of the ending from the book actually didn't even bother me that much, so long as people who have read the book are aware its going to be in the second movie then I believe that they won't be that bothered. Overall Golden Compass is an entertaining two hours, that could benefit from another half hour. Its a great film to watch for Christmas and will hopefully do well at the box office so the Subtle Knife is made very soon.\n\nThe biggest surprise of the cast definitely comes from Dakota Blue Richards as the lead, Lyra. In the trailers I actually thought that Lyra looked terrible, her voice sounded monotone and the girl showed no expression. Thankfuly in the movie that is far from the truth. Richards pulls off the character of Lyra perfectly, she's cheeky, at times rude but alway likable and definitely well acted. Her cockney accent surprisingly works and never gets too irritating, although at first it takes some adjusting too, and her emotions throughout the film are very well displayed. She carries the entire movie very well and it will be great to see her return in the future films as I know how much dramatic stuff she will have to do. But its Nicole Kidman who practically runs over the hills with this movie. Mrs Coulter was always my favourite character in the movie, and Kidman delivers an icy turn as the villainess. Kidman makes her multi-layered and highly memorable, her best scenes definitely being towards the end. Daniel Craig unfortunately features very little, but he delivers a great performance. Eva Green is superb as Serafine Pekkala but once again features way too little for my liking.

Aside from nearly every Python appearing to good effect, we have a touching performance from Steve Coogan as the downtrodden Mole, Anthony Sher as a hissable Chief Weasel and... well to many famous faces to mention.\n\nWhat makes this version stand out is the stunning costume and production design by James Acherson.  This is a caricartured version of olde England, with the animals played by cartoonish humans rather than anthromorphosised animals.  The sun always shines, everything is polished and colourful. There's some subtle satire about the class system going on in the background but director Jones doesn't let that get in the way.  Only the factory subplot strikes a wrong note, tending to clutter up the last half of the film but not seriously. Genuinely for children of all ages.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3183,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2000-06-21","keywords":"weasel,mole,toad,rat,mating","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Wind in the Willows","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi418560793","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMxMmZmZGEtNjZkMC00NjdiLWIyMWYtNzY5NWQ3NWQyMGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMxMmZmZGEtNjZkMC00NjdiLWIyMWYtNzY5NWQ3NWQyMGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176869/","name":"Steve Coogan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001385/","name":"Eric Idle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001402/","name":"Terry Jones"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001402/","name":"Terry Jones"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052092/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001402/","name":"Terry Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334370/","name":"Kenneth Grahame"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Aside from nearly every Python appearing to good effect, we have a touching performance from Steve Coogan as the downtrodden Mole, Anthony Sher as a hissable Chief Weasel and... well to many famous faces to mention.\n\nWhat makes this version stand out is the stunning costume and production design by James Acherson.  This is a caricartured version of olde England, with the animals played by cartoonish humans rather than anthromorphosised animals.  The sun always shines, everything is polished and colourful. There's some subtle satire about the class system going on in the background but director Jones doesn't let that get in the way.  Only the factory subplot strikes a wrong note, tending to clutter up the last half of the film but not seriously. Genuinely for children of all ages.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3183,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2000-06-21","keywords":"weasel,mole,toad,rat,mating","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Wind in the Willows","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi418560793","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMxMmZmZGEtNjZkMC00NjdiLWIyMWYtNzY5NWQ3NWQyMGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMxMmZmZGEtNjZkMC00NjdiLWIyMWYtNzY5NWQ3NWQyMGMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176869/","name":"Steve Coogan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001385/","name":"Eric Idle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001402/","name":"Terry Jones"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001402/","name":"Terry Jones"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052092/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001402/","name":"Terry Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334370/","name":"Kenneth Grahame"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And in another scene, the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White is "She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled, she's not easy."  While these subtle comedic lines amuse adults, it is the simple humor, such as the movie opening with the ogre sitting in a swamp "farting," that amuses children.

I am a huge fan of the His Dark Materials books, and was reading all three in preparation for the movie to come, I was praying this would be the new fantasy epic to watch. I suppose I got myself way too hyped for this movie, even the slightly negative reviews didn't stop me from being excited, so what a shame to say this cannot help but be a disappointment for me. I have a few major problems with this mainly, mainly I suppose because of the changes from the book, in fact had I have not read the book I most probably would have completely adored the movie rather than have just liked it. The Golden Compass is not a bad movie, its definitely better than the first Narnia movie and Harry Potter movie, but after reading the book I couldn't help but criticise because I know how amazing this movie could have been. Thankfuly the entire cast, yes the entire cast, are absolutely perfect, there are two notable set pieces and the storyline still keeps its grip on the audience despite being rushed. The lack of the ending from the book actually didn't even bother me that much, so long as people who have read the book are aware its going to be in the second movie then I believe that they won't be that bothered. Overall Golden Compass is an entertaining two hours, that could benefit from another half hour. Its a great film to watch for Christmas and will hopefully do well at the box office so the Subtle Knife is made very soon.\n\nThe biggest surprise of the cast definitely comes from Dakota Blue Richards as the lead, Lyra. In the trailers I actually thought that Lyra looked terrible, her voice sounded monotone and the girl showed no expression. Thankfuly in the movie that is far from the truth. Richards pulls off the character of Lyra perfectly, she's cheeky, at times rude but alway likable and definitely well acted. Her cockney accent surprisingly works and never gets too irritating, although at first it takes some adjusting too, and her emotions throughout the film are very well displayed. She carries the entire movie very well and it will be great to see her return in the future films as I know how much dramatic stuff she will have to do. But its Nicole Kidman who practically runs over the hills with this movie. Mrs Coulter was always my favourite character in the movie, and Kidman delivers an icy turn as the villainess. Kidman makes her multi-layered and highly memorable, her best scenes definitely being towards the end. Daniel Craig unfortunately features very little, but he delivers a great performance. Eva Green is superb as Serafine Pekkala but once again features way too little for my liking. The other two superb characters, and my joint second favourite performances, come from Ian Mckellen doing the voice of Iorek, and Sam Eliott who is perfectly cast as Lee Scoresby.\n\nHowever despite the incredible performances its the cruel way things have been changed or cut that made me incapable of ever giving this higher than a 7/10. I will never understand to this day why the polar bear fight was changed from near the end to the middle, and why the Bolvangar scenes are so unnecessarily rushed its almost cruel. Also changing certain characters and changing certain facts just infuriated me all the more! But the ultimate problem with the movie is the fact it is way too rushed. Occasionally it is a blessing to get a two hour movie rather than a bloated two and a half hour once, but this story requires all the time it can get, and with events just taking up mere seconds and events being cut out (fans of the book will hate The Cocktail Party not being in the film) makes the film feel too short and missing something. Thankfuly the bear fight is as incredible as I hoped for, it ends in very cool way, and the final battle at Bolvangar, while way too short is definitely well done. The movie also packs an emotional punch at times, the intercision scenes are pitch perfect and the ending is amazing in my eyes in terms of emotion. The effects of the daemons are very well done, and the daemons themselves are pretty cool, most namely Mrs Coulter's golden monkey which will terrify kids for a while.\n\nThe Golden Compass is hardly the new Lord of the Rings as many, including me admittedly, had hoped for, but thankfully it looks much more promising than the Narnia series and perhaps with a new director, and less editing, this series could really take off. But for now I just need to get over my slight disappointment of it. Still very much worth watching though.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183240,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-05-14","keywords":"orphan,parallel universe,quest,missing child,kidnapping","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Golden Compass","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2813395225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNTQ1NzgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTIxODAz._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyNTQ1NzgwNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMTIxODAz._V1_.jpg","description":"The Golden Compass - Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0185819/","name":"Daniel Craig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2301950/","name":"Dakota Blue Richards"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919363/","name":"Chris Weitz"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136728/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012870/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919363/","name":"Chris Weitz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1099514/","name":"Philip Pullman"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="de">The Boxtrolls: Directed by Graham Annable, Anthony Stacchi. With Steve Blum, Dee Bradley Baker, Max Mitchell, Ben Kingsley. A young orphaned boy raised by underground cave-dwelling trash collectors tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0787474/","name":"The Boxtrolls","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODA5MDkyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMyNjkzMjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young orphaned boy raised by underground cave-dwelling trash collectors tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0787474/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"jadepietro"},"dateCreated":"2014-10-01","inLanguage":"English","name":"Thinking Outside the Box","reviewBody":"This film is recommended.\n\nThe Boxtrolls, a well-crafted stop motion animation film combined with the latest CGI advances, is an entertaining but somewhat safer and slightly sanitized film from Laika, the same studio that delivered Coraline and ParaNorman, two earlier children's film with a twisted Gothic edge. A pleasant antidote to the cheery Disney fare regularly served to the young set, the film is diverting fun. \n\nThere are still twists and turns in the film but it's less of a giddy roller coaster ride than expected. Based on Alan Snow's novel, Here Be Monsters, the darker tone of the book has been substantially altered and lightened up for a more crowd-pleasing effect, although there are some grotesque moments that may frighten the little ones.\n\nMoviegoers are immediately transported to the dingy squalor of brick factories and small shoppes that line the cobblestone streets of Dicken's Ole Victorian London town, or, in this case, renamed Cheesebridge. The upper and lower class live here, both in fear of the Boxtrolls, a lower lower subspecies that dwell underground who are part monster, part cardboard. Living amidst them is Eggs, an abandoned child who was lovingly raised by these creatures that roam the night to recycle the discarded refuse left by people. They avoid human contact as much as possible. Who can blame them! There is the haughty and aristocratic Lord and Lady Portley-Rind, their inquisitive and precocious daughter, Winnie, and especially Archibald Snatcher, a scheming and hateful villain whose main goal is to do away with all Boxtrolls! \n\nAs with most animated films nowadays, the visual elements are far superior to the narrative story. The Boxtrolls are not the exception. While the script has some clever dialog, an involving tale, and its charming characters, the plot becomes too formula-driven and conventional. The screenplay by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava relies too heavily on slapstick and chase sequences rather than developing any deep characterizations. The Boxtrolls themselves lack any real distinctive personalities and that British droll humor is in short supply. Everything seems a tad too predictable and ordinary, except for the artistry of the filmmakers and their wonderful details with the elaborate settings, steam-punk gadgetry, and off-beat characters. Special kudos to the remarkable production design by Paul Lasaine. \n\nThe voice-over work by the actors (Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Tracy Morgan) is highly accomplished and adds even more joy to the film, especially with Sir Ben Kingley's marvelous line delivery as the nasty baddie who completely steals the film. (In fact, Archibald is more interesting than our hero, Eggs, at least, as viewed in this film adaptation. Kingsley has created one of the best animated villains in years, although part of his great performance pays direct homage to Dame Edna.)\n\nDirectors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi painstakingly create a unique world of grime and clutter. They also allow the surreal elements to emerge to maximum effect, particularly in the underground sequences.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 0787474, Title: The Boxtrolls, 
 --- Description: The Boxtrolls: Directed by Graham Annable, Anthony Stacchi. With Steve Blum, Dee Bradley Baker, Max Mitchell, Ben Kingsley. A young orphaned boy raised by underground cave-dwelling trash collectors tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0787474/","name":"The Boxtrolls","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODA5MDkyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMyNjkzMjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young orphaned boy raised by underground cave-dwelling trash collectors tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0787474/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"jadepietro","dateCreated":"2014-10-01","inLanguage":"English","name":"Thinking Outside the Box","reviewBody":"This film is recommended.\n\nThe Boxtrolls, a well-crafted stop motion animation film combined with the latest CGI advances, is an entertaining but somewhat safer and slightly sanitized film from Laika, the same studio that delivered Coraline and ParaNorman, two earlier children's film with a twisted Gothic edge. A pleasant antidote to the cheery Disney fare regularly served to the young set, the film is diverting fun. \n\nThere are still twists and turns in the film but it's less of a giddy roller coaster ride than expected. Based on Alan Snow's novel, Here Be Monsters, the darker tone of the book has been substantially altered and lightened up for a more crowd-pleasing effect, although there are some grotesque moments that may frighten the little ones.\n\nMoviegoers are immediately transported to the dingy squalor of brick factories and small shoppes that line the cobblestone streets of Dicken's Ole Victorian London town, or, in this case, renamed Cheesebridge. The upper and lower class live here, both in fear of the Boxtrolls, a lower lower subspecies that dwell underground who are part monster, part cardboard. Living amidst them is Eggs, an abandoned child who was lovingly raised by these creatures that roam the night to recycle the discarded refuse left by people. They avoid human contact as much as possible. Who can blame them! There is the haughty and aristocratic Lord and Lady Portley-Rind, their inquisitive and precocious daughter, Winnie, and especially Archibald Snatcher, a scheming and hateful villain whose main goal is to do away with all Boxtrolls! \n\nAs with most animated films nowadays, the visual elements are far superior to the narrative story. The Boxtrolls are not the exception. While the script has some clever dialog, an involving tale, and its charming characters, the plot becomes too formula-driven and conventional. The screenplay by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava relies too heavily on slapstick and chase sequences rather than developing any deep characterizations. The Boxtrolls themselves lack any real distinctive personalities and that British droll humor is in short supply. Everything seems a tad too predictable and ordinary, except for the artistry of the filmmakers and their wonderful details with the elaborate settings, steam-punk gadgetry, and off-beat characters. Special kudos to the remarkable production design by Paul Lasaine. \n\nThe voice-over work by the actors (Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Tracy Morgan) is highly accomplished and adds even more joy to the film, especially with Sir Ben Kingley's marvelous line delivery as the nasty baddie who completely steals the film. (In fact, Archibald is more interesting than our hero, Eggs, at least, as viewed in this film adaptation. Kingsley has created one of the best animated villains in years, although part of his great performance pays direct homage to Dame Edna.)\n\nDirectors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi painstakingly create a unique world of grime and clutter. They also allow the surreal elements to emerge to maximum effect, particularly in the underground sequences. Though the film lacks some cohesiveness in its story-telling, The Boxtrolls, more often than not, does think outside the box. With all its creative energy and technical inventiveness on display, even Roald Dahl would be proud.

The fourth-grader left behind her bosom buddies back in Iowa, and her family is relocating in the wake of her grandfather's passing.\n\nIntent on starting out on the right foot, Chrissa (Sammi Hanratty) promptly runs afoul of a clutch of Alpha Female bullies who pile on the abuse and push the hapless newcomer to the brink of dropping out in favor of home-schooling. But with a little help from her wise grandmother and a perceptive art teacher (Jennifer Tilly), she learns to stare down her adversaries, claim her place as a member of the student body, and provide a role model for bullying victims of all stripes. \n\n"American Girl: Chrissa Stands Strong" is a thoroughly earnest drama that squeezes the protagonist through a painful gamut of pre-adolescent conflicts, engineered primarily by Tara, the bully in chief played with wicked relish by the very capable Adair Tishler. \n\nYoung viewers will have little problem soaking up every drop of pathos projected by Miss Hanratty and by an even more sympathetic co-victim, a little homeless girl played to the hilt by Kaitlyn Dever.\n\nJust a few things worth pointing out: Dealing with the subject of bullying apparently prompted the decision here not to make light of anything. Thus, the main problem with "Chrissa" is that there are almost no light moments. Good story-tellers know that humor is one of the best ways to relieve tension for viewers. Other than a spitting llama and a quirky characterization by the trouper Miss Tilly, there's not much to chuckle about in this movie. Miss Hanratty is convincing in various degrees of angst, but the movie may leave youngsters a bit exhausted by the time the theme is realized on camera: that is, standing up to bullies opens the door to friendship. \n\nAnother problem is the puzzling lack of motivation shown for Tara. Apparently she is insecure but we don't get much insight into what drives her to be Mean Girl No. 1 in this classroom. But then, maybe an exceptionally pretty, somewhat haughty little girl doesn't need any other reason to be mean. \n\nAs with other movies in the "American Girl" series, the subtext is in product placement. Here, it's a fashion show of contemporary looks. The cast is costumed in closets full of attractive dresses, sweaters, skirts, tops, headbands, swimwear  not to mention tights in a rainbow of colors.\n\nThis movie will no doubt give many young viewers a lot of exciting ideas for the next time they go shopping for their dolls and themselves.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":952,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2009-01-05","keywords":"bully,girl,bullying,minnesota,friendship","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1767820/","name":"Samantha Hanratty"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001272/","name":"Annabeth Gish"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000961/","name":"Timothy Bottoms"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004838/","name":"Martha Coolidge"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0559023/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086773/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3231779/","name":"Mary Casanova"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3039414/","name":"Christine Coyle Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3039970/","name":"Julie Prendiville Roux"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered that Bridesmaids is better than The Hangover. I have yet to see The Hangover Part 2, so I can't comment on any similarities/differences that might or might not exist. But one thing is for sure: Kristen Wiig has proved her worth as a female lead with a serious amount of comedic clout.\n\nThe story isn't revolutionary: one of two best friends is getting married, and everything involved with said nuptials is threatening to tear their lifelong friendship apart.

Imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered that Bridesmaids is better than The Hangover. I have yet to see The Hangover Part 2, so I can't comment on any similarities/differences that might or might not exist. But one thing is for sure: Kristen Wiig has proved her worth as a female lead with a serious amount of comedic clout.\n\nThe story isn't revolutionary: one of two best friends is getting married, and everything involved with said nuptials is threatening to tear their lifelong friendship apart. At the center of this battle is Helen, a newly acquired "friend"—via the merging of two exclusive social circles—who begins taking over the wedding plans for Lillian (Rudolph). Annie (Wiig) makes it her mission to take out this she-devil, and what follows is the setup for one of the more memorable meltdowns (among a plethora of other things) to come along in quite some time.

Not a bad movie, just nothing new and no surprises for the viewer.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-10-26","keywords":"singing in a car,female teacher,teacher student relationship,teacher student conflict,munich germany","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4153260825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBhZGNlYTctYmYxYi00YmU2LTlhMDItN2E0ZjRjNzU4NmNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBhZGNlYTctYmYxYi00YmU2LTlhMDItN2E0ZjRjNzU4NmNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065929/","name":"Elyas M'Barek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0726257/","name":"Katja Riemann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3436464/","name":"Jella Haase"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1480916/","name":"Bora Dagtekin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1480916/","name":"Bora Dagtekin"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

According to inequality org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth, whilst the poorest 64% of the population control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the milieu of Greed, a hilarious satire from prolific genre-hopping writer/director Michael Winterbottom. Examining how the rich get richer, the film focuses on a successful British clothing entrepreneur, and its bread and butter is the concomitant grotesquery that results when an individual has the same wealth as a small country. Mixing send-up and satire with more serious socio-economic points, Greed doesn't really do or say a huge amount that hasn't been done or said before, but it's entertaining, amusing, and undeniably relevant.\n\nSir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan) is one of Britain's richest men. The perma-tanned "self-made" billionaire is the owner of several clothing chains and is known as "the King of the High Street", although a less complimentary nickname is "Greedy" McCreadie. The non-linear narrative depicts 1) his rise to power, when, as a young man (played by a wonderfully loathsome Jamie Blackley), he opens multiple businesses (all of which fail) as he learns the ins and outs of asset-stripping and the importance of using foreign sweatshops; 2) in the modern-day, we see him hauled before a Parliamentary Select Committee convened to investigate the bankruptcy of one of his chains; and, 3) in the film's present, on the Greek island of Mykonos, the final (chaotic) touches are being put to McCreadie's Roman-themed 60th birthday bash - complete with mandatory togas, a fake coliseum, and a real, albeit somnolent, lion. Much of the story is told through the lens of McCreadie's "official biographer" Nick (David Mitchell), a classically-trained literature buff who drops quotes from Shakespeare and Shelley into everyday conversation, and who hates himself for agreeing to write a fawning celebration of McCreadie.\n\nThe idea that a billionaire could be so cut off from workaday reality as to stage a Roman-themed birthday party on a Greek island may sound far too on the nose, too ridiculously hubristic to say anything of any worth, too over-the-top to even function as satire. However, McCreadie is based on Sir Philip Green, chairman of the Arcadia Group, avoider of taxes, exploiter of the working-class, asset-stripper, and enemy of the #MeToo movement. Similarly, many of the details of McCreadie's ludicrous birthday are lifted verbatim from Green's very real 50th birthday celebrations in 2002 - when he flew 219 guests to Cyprus for a three-day toga party.\n\nMcCreadie, of course, is a hilariously despicable slimeball, a man who unironically feels hard done by when Syrian refugees show up on the (public) beach he's using for his birthday, and both Coogan and Blackley portray him as not only narcissistic and void of conscience, but as a completely classless philistine - whereas Nick, for example, can quote Shakespeare and recite Shelley, lofty symbols of Englishness both, McCreadie proudly gets his cultural know-how from BrainyQuote. However, the important point is that for all his loathsomeness, McCreadie is a symbol for the system that gave rise to and sustains him. For all his crass hubristic excess, McCreadie is neither an aberrant individual nor is he a criminal - he's an especially vulgar product of the system. And, with the crushing defeat of Labour in the 2019 English general election, it seems he's the product of a system which the vast majority of people appear to support.\n\nThe film gets pretty serious towards the end, and before the closing credits, a series of title cards detail some of the facts and figures of global economic disparity, particularly concerning the vast gulf between those who make the clothes we wear and those who sell them to us. Originally, these cards named specific brands as especially guilty of exploiting sweatshop employees, pointing out, for example, that workers in Myanmar earn $3.60 a day making clothes for H&amp;M, whilst owner Stefan Persson is worth $18 billion, and workers in Bangladesh earn $2.84 a day making clothes for Zara, whilst owner Amancio Ortega is worth $68 billion. However, Sony Pictures International, which financed the film with Film4, refused to allow Winterbottom to use these cards, with company head Laine Kline telling him, "we're worried about the potential damage to Sony's corporate relations with these brands". And so replacement cards were used, which feature much of the same information but without reference to any specific companies or people. So how do we know what the original cards said? Because Winterbottom, very much in the viciously sardonic spirit of the film, read them out on-stage after the world première in Toronto! Kline, who was in the audience, was far from impressed, which may account for the shoddy advertising campaign, with the film being released into theatres with virtually no market awareness. Whatever the case, Kline seems unaware of the irony of his actions - in relation to a film which accuses the rich of all manner of shenanigans to insulate and protect themselves and their fortunes, a massive corporate entity has exerted its authority to protect other massive corporate entities. It's like something McCreadie himself would do.\n\nAesthetically, the film employs a plethora of techniques, including non-linear editing, direct-to-camera addresses, YouTube videos to provide exposition, split-screen, fake news footage, and title cards. However, it's at its most effective when at its simplest, particularly in scenes involving the wonderful Dinita Gohil as McCreadie's overworked, under-appreciated PA. Amanda's interactions with Nick provide the emotional core of the story, and there's nothing bombastic or ostentatious about their construction - it's all simple shot/counter-shot editing and blocking. And by far the film's best sequence, which comes towards the end, is another simple setup involving Amanda and McCreadie, wherein the scene tells its story not through aesthetic construction or even through dialogue, but through the expression on Gohil's face. It's the moment during which Winterbottom drops all pretence of comedy and focuses on the more serious issues that have hovered at the fringes since the opening seconds.\n\nIf I were to focus on any one problem, it would be two underdeveloped subplots. A (staged) reality TV show subplot involving McCreadie's daughter Lily (Sophie Cookson) provides for some very funny individual moments, but it contributes nothing whatsoever to the main plot. Additionally, the fact that McCreadie and his ex-wife Samantha (Isla Fisher) are still in love with one another is a theme which never really goes anywhere, which is a shame, as it could have provided some much-needed character development for her and some shades of grey for him.\n\nFor better or worse, we live in an age where there are more billionaires than ever before, and Greed is a comedy about the excess and disconnect of such people. However, so too is it a cautionary tale, a reminder that just because we're removed from exploitation doesn't mean such exploitation isn't happening.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5829,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-02-21","keywords":"husband wife relationship,fashion industry,fashion show,flashback within a flashback within a flashback,greece","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3277897497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Greed' tells the story of self-made British billionaire Sir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan), whose retail empire is in crisis.

The plot is about a disfunctional (or not) family that tries to get by using inventive scams to gather some money. Nothing they will get rich of, just a bunch of lowlife scams that are funny to watch. The family is played by Richard Jenkins, Debra Winger (which I didn't recognize) and Evan Rachel Wood.

That is if you're not too picky and can enjoy a movie without the urge of being too critical all the time. Kajillionaire is certainly not a bad movie, it's different and sometimes a bit weird, but it's definitely entertaining. The plot is about a disfunctional (or not) family that tries to get by using inventive scams to gather some money. Nothing they will get rich of, just a bunch of lowlife scams that are funny to watch. The family is played by Richard Jenkins, Debra Winger (which I didn't recognize) and Evan Rachel Wood. The whole crew did a good job. Kajillionaire might not be an award winning movie but it's good enough for a good movie night.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14376,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-25","keywords":"father daughter relationship,mother daughter relationship,heist,family of criminals,grifter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3764567577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ4YWQzMDAtZTkzYi00Yzc0LThjNWMtMjM3MDMzMDZlZGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQ4YWQzMDAtZTkzYi00Yzc0LThjNWMtMjM3MDMzMDZlZGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"From acclaimed writer/director Miranda July comes a profoundly moving and wildly original comedy.

There are few movies as humorous as this one, being "Mousehunt" one of those few - another 1997 motion picture.\n\nEvery minute of "Liar Liar" is pure fun and every minute means a good laughter. Many moments are hysterical! Jim Carrey is often a great comedian, but this is him at his funniest side.\n\nThe story is very funny and entertaining: Fletcher Reede, a lawyer with the habit of lying and breaking promises, suddenly sees himself forced to become honest during the next 24 hours after his son's birthday wish comes true. He doesn't understand what's happening to him and that is driving him insane... he can't tell any lies, not even write a little lie!

Max is also referred to as "Maximillian" and "Monster Max" by his father, who loves to do "The Claw" much for his son's delight. I know Cary Elwes from "Robin Hood: Men in Tights" and I do know that he is an English actor, but he speaks with a good American accent in this film. Some might think that Jim Carrey overacts here and that his humor is too crummy, but the energy he shows here is not something anybody could do. It requires a very energetic and patient comedian and Jim Carrey proves his talent to do so. The kid is cute. He almost looks like Sean Marshall in "Pete's Dragon", with that face and long hair.\n\nAt my point of view, "Liar Liar" has funny humor, not irritating or dirty humor. It is a modern light-hearted comedy. Its aim is purely fun at the highest level. I think it's difficult not laughing while watching this movie. Lots of very funny lines are another attribute.\n\nDirected by Tom Shadyac, "Liar Liar" is the best thing Jim Carrey and Tom Shadyac ever did together and slightly superior than the later "Bruce Almighty".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":292374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1997-03-21","keywords":"birthday wish,obscene finger gesture,female stockinged feet,pantyhose,workaholic","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000120/","name":"Jim Carrey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005491/","name":"Maura Tierney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000372/","name":"Amanda Donohoe"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001723/","name":"Tom Shadyac"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0345488/","name":"Paul Guay"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0563397/","name":"Stephen Mazur"}],"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The first movie was surprisingly good and not as expected. The second movie played in an entirely different environment which added a few new elements to the story. Now the third movie's setting is back where it all started: at school.\n\nTo me it seemed like the movie does not really know what it wants to do. In the first two movies, the main protagonist (the ex-con teacher) gradually opened up to the children, became friendlier, and started to care for them. This movie reboots the whole thing by making our guy dislike the children at first, only to let him warm up throughout the movie once more. In general the movie seems to re-establish many things for viewers who have not seen the first two movies. The same thing goes for the jokes, which are very similar to the two previous movies, too similar even. Overall I just felt like the two movies never happened and we are seeing more or less the same thing again. Maybe this is why the first half-hour of the movie also seemed a bit like not having a clear purpose at all. The movie wants to establish the situation, but not really. It wants to continue where the predecessors left off, but not really. It throws around jokes that are not new, really.\n\nThe second part of the movie gets more interesting and starts following a clearer story-line, albeit in a linear and predictable way. This is not unsurprising for a comedy, but compared to the predecessors it is just not as good.\n\nIf you truly enjoyed the first two movies, you will still like this one.

The first movie was surprisingly good and not as expected. The second movie played in an entirely different environment which added a few new elements to the story. Now the third movie's setting is back where it all started: at school.\n\nTo me it seemed like the movie does not really know what it wants to do. In the first two movies, the main protagonist (the ex-con teacher) gradually opened up to the children, became friendlier, and started to care for them. This movie reboots the whole thing by making our guy dislike the children at first, only to let him warm up throughout the movie once more. In general the movie seems to re-establish many things for viewers who have not seen the first two movies. The same thing goes for the jokes, which are very similar to the two previous movies, too similar even. Overall I just felt like the two movies never happened and we are seeing more or less the same thing again. Maybe this is why the first half-hour of the movie also seemed a bit like not having a clear purpose at all. The movie wants to establish the situation, but not really. It wants to continue where the predecessors left off, but not really. It throws around jokes that are not new, really.\n\nThe second part of the movie gets more interesting and starts following a clearer story-line, albeit in a linear and predictable way. This is not unsurprising for a comedy, but compared to the predecessors it is just not as good.\n\nIf you truly enjoyed the first two movies, you will still like this one. If you did not care for the first two movies, this one is definitely not for you. It suffers from exactly the same problems as similar trilogies at the point of the third installment. Take Despicable Me for example. Not a bad movie, just nothing new and no surprises for the viewer.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-10-26","keywords":"singing in a car,female teacher,teacher student relationship,teacher student conflict,munich germany","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4153260825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBhZGNlYTctYmYxYi00YmU2LTlhMDItN2E0ZjRjNzU4NmNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBhZGNlYTctYmYxYi00YmU2LTlhMDItN2E0ZjRjNzU4NmNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065929/","name":"Elyas M'Barek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0726257/","name":"Katja Riemann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3436464/","name":"Jella Haase"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1480916/","name":"Bora Dagtekin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1480916/","name":"Bora Dagtekin"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

According to inequality org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth, whilst the poorest 64% of the population control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the milieu of Greed, a hilarious satire from prolific genre-hopping writer/director Michael Winterbottom. Examining how the rich get richer, the film focuses on a successful British clothing entrepreneur, and its bread and butter is the concomitant grotesquery that results when an individual has the same wealth as a small country. Mixing send-up and satire with more serious socio-economic points, Greed doesn't really do or say a huge amount that hasn't been done or said before, but it's entertaining, amusing, and undeniably relevant.\n\nSir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan) is one of Britain's richest men. The perma-tanned "self-made" billionaire is the owner of several clothing chains and is known as "the King of the High Street", although a less complimentary nickname is "Greedy" McCreadie. The non-linear narrative depicts 1) his rise to power, when, as a young man (played by a wonderfully loathsome Jamie Blackley), he opens multiple businesses (all of which fail) as he learns the ins and outs of asset-stripping and the importance of using foreign sweatshops; 2) in the modern-day, we see him hauled before a Parliamentary Select Committee convened to investigate the bankruptcy of one of his chains; and, 3) in the film's present, on the Greek island of Mykonos, the final (chaotic) touches are being put to McCreadie's Roman-themed 60th birthday bash - complete with mandatory togas, a fake coliseum, and a real, albeit somnolent, lion. Much of the story is told through the lens of McCreadie's "official biographer" Nick (David Mitchell), a classically-trained literature buff who drops quotes from Shakespeare and Shelley into everyday conversation, and who hates himself for agreeing to write a fawning celebration of McCreadie.\n\nThe idea that a billionaire could be so cut off from workaday reality as to stage a Roman-themed birthday party on a Greek island may sound far too on the nose, too ridiculously hubristic to say anything of any worth, too over-the-top to even function as satire. However, McCreadie is based on Sir Philip Green, chairman of the Arcadia Group, avoider of taxes, exploiter of the working-class, asset-stripper, and enemy of the #MeToo movement. Similarly, many of the details of McCreadie's ludicrous birthday are lifted verbatim from Green's very real 50th birthday celebrations in 2002 - when he flew 219 guests to Cyprus for a three-day toga party.\n\nMcCreadie, of course, is a hilariously despicable slimeball, a man who unironically feels hard done by when Syrian refugees show up on the (public) beach he's using for his birthday, and both Coogan and Blackley portray him as not only narcissistic and void of conscience, but as a completely classless philistine - whereas Nick, for example, can quote Shakespeare and recite Shelley, lofty symbols of Englishness both, McCreadie proudly gets his cultural know-how from BrainyQuote. However, the important point is that for all his loathsomeness, McCreadie is a symbol for the system that gave rise to and sustains him. For all his crass hubristic excess, McCreadie is neither an aberrant individual nor is he a criminal - he's an especially vulgar product of the system. And, with the crushing defeat of Labour in the 2019 English general election, it seems he's the product of a system which the vast majority of people appear to support.\n\nThe film gets pretty serious towards the end, and before the closing credits, a series of title cards detail some of the facts and figures of global economic disparity, particularly concerning the vast gulf between those who make the clothes we wear and those who sell them to us. Originally, these cards named specific brands as especially guilty of exploiting sweatshop employees, pointing out, for example, that workers in Myanmar earn $3.60 a day making clothes for H&amp;M, whilst owner Stefan Persson is worth $18 billion, and workers in Bangladesh earn $2.84 a day making clothes for Zara, whilst owner Amancio Ortega is worth $68 billion. However, Sony Pictures International, which financed the film with Film4, refused to allow Winterbottom to use these cards, with company head Laine Kline telling him, "we're worried about the potential damage to Sony's corporate relations with these brands". And so replacement cards were used, which feature much of the same information but without reference to any specific companies or people. So how do we know what the original cards said? Because Winterbottom, very much in the viciously sardonic spirit of the film, read them out on-stage after the world première in Toronto! Kline, who was in the audience, was far from impressed, which may account for the shoddy advertising campaign, with the film being released into theatres with virtually no market awareness. Whatever the case, Kline seems unaware of the irony of his actions - in relation to a film which accuses the rich of all manner of shenanigans to insulate and protect themselves and their fortunes, a massive corporate entity has exerted its authority to protect other massive corporate entities. It's like something McCreadie himself would do.\n\nAesthetically, the film employs a plethora of techniques, including non-linear editing, direct-to-camera addresses, YouTube videos to provide exposition, split-screen, fake news footage, and title cards. However, it's at its most effective when at its simplest, particularly in scenes involving the wonderful Dinita Gohil as McCreadie's overworked, under-appreciated PA. Amanda's interactions with Nick provide the emotional core of the story, and there's nothing bombastic or ostentatious about their construction - it's all simple shot/counter-shot editing and blocking. And by far the film's best sequence, which comes towards the end, is another simple setup involving Amanda and McCreadie, wherein the scene tells its story not through aesthetic construction or even through dialogue, but through the expression on Gohil's face. It's the moment during which Winterbottom drops all pretence of comedy and focuses on the more serious issues that have hovered at the fringes since the opening seconds.\n\nIf I were to focus on any one problem, it would be two underdeveloped subplots. A (staged) reality TV show subplot involving McCreadie's daughter Lily (Sophie Cookson) provides for some very funny individual moments, but it contributes nothing whatsoever to the main plot. Additionally, the fact that McCreadie and his ex-wife Samantha (Isla Fisher) are still in love with one another is a theme which never really goes anywhere, which is a shame, as it could have provided some much-needed character development for her and some shades of grey for him.\n\nFor better or worse, we live in an age where there are more billionaires than ever before, and Greed is a comedy about the excess and disconnect of such people. However, so too is it a cautionary tale, a reminder that just because we're removed from exploitation doesn't mean such exploitation isn't happening.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5829,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-02-21","keywords":"husband wife relationship,fashion industry,fashion show,flashback within a flashback within a flashback,greece","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3277897497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Greed' tells the story of self-made British billionaire Sir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan), whose retail empire is in crisis.

 --- Description: Greed: Directed by Michael Winterbottom. With Caroline Flack, Steve Coogan, David Mitchell, Isla Fisher. Satire about the world of the super-rich." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt8972256/","name":"Greed","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDUzZDc3ZGYtOWZmNi00ZWIyLWE3YTYtNjRmZWZhMDNmNjhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyOTgxNDIzMTY@._V1_.jpg","description":"Satire about the world of the super-rich.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt8972256/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Bertaut","dateCreated":"2020-03-03","inLanguage":"English","name":"A savage and hilarious satire","reviewBody":"We live in an era where wealth is distributed upwards and the gap between the haves and have-nots has become wider than ever. According to inequality org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth, whilst the poorest 64% of the population control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the milieu of Greed, a hilarious satire from prolific genre-hopping writer/director Michael Winterbottom. Examining how the rich get richer, the film focuses on a successful British clothing entrepreneur, and its bread and butter is the concomitant grotesquery that results when an individual has the same wealth as a small country. Mixing send-up and satire with more serious socio-economic points, Greed doesn't really do or say a huge amount that hasn't been done or said before, but it's entertaining, amusing, and undeniably relevant.\n\nSir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan) is one of Britain's richest men. The perma-tanned "self-made" billionaire is the owner of several clothing chains and is known as "the King of the High Street", although a less complimentary nickname is "Greedy" McCreadie. The non-linear narrative depicts 1) his rise to power, when, as a young man (played by a wonderfully loathsome Jamie Blackley), he opens multiple businesses (all of which fail) as he learns the ins and outs of asset-stripping and the importance of using foreign sweatshops; 2) in the modern-day, we see him hauled before a Parliamentary Select Committee convened to investigate the bankruptcy of one of his chains; and, 3) in the film's present, on the Greek island of Mykonos, the final (chaotic) touches are being put to McCreadie's Roman-themed 60th birthday bash - complete with mandatory togas, a fake coliseum, and a real, albeit somnolent, lion. Much of the story is told through the lens of McCreadie's "official biographer" Nick (David Mitchell), a classically-trained literature buff who drops quotes from Shakespeare and Shelley into everyday conversation, and who hates himself for agreeing to write a fawning celebration of McCreadie.\n\nThe idea that a billionaire could be so cut off from workaday reality as to stage a Roman-themed birthday party on a Greek island may sound far too on the nose, too ridiculously hubristic to say anything of any worth, too over-the-top to even function as satire. However, McCreadie is based on Sir Philip Green, chairman of the Arcadia Group, avoider of taxes, exploiter of the working-class, asset-stripper, and enemy of the #MeToo movement. Similarly, many of the details of McCreadie's ludicrous birthday are lifted verbatim from Green's very real 50th birthday celebrations in 2002 - when he flew 219 guests to Cyprus for a three-day toga party.\n\nMcCreadie, of course, is a hilariously despicable slimeball, a man who unironically feels hard done by when Syrian refugees show up on the (public) beach he's using for his birthday, and both Coogan and Blackley portray him as not only narcissistic and void of conscience, but as a completely classless philistine - whereas Nick, for example, can quote Shakespeare and recite Shelley, lofty symbols of Englishness both, McCreadie proudly gets his cultural know-how from BrainyQuote. However, the important point is that for all his loathsomeness, McCreadie is a symbol for the system that gave rise to and sustains him. For all his crass hubristic excess, McCreadie is neither an aberrant individual nor is he a criminal - he's an especially vulgar product of the system. And, with the crushing defeat of Labour in the 2019 English general election, it seems he's the product of a system which the vast majority of people appear to support.\n\nThe film gets pretty serious towards the end, and before the closing credits, a series of title cards detail some of the facts and figures of global economic disparity, particularly concerning the vast gulf between those who make the clothes we wear and those who sell them to us. Originally, these cards named specific brands as especially guilty of exploiting sweatshop employees, pointing out, for example, that workers in Myanmar earn $3.60 a day making clothes for H&amp;M, whilst owner Stefan Persson is worth $18 billion, and workers in Bangladesh earn $2.84 a day making clothes for Zara, whilst owner Amancio Ortega is worth $68 billion. However, Sony Pictures International, which financed the film with Film4, refused to allow Winterbottom to use these cards, with company head Laine Kline telling him, "we're worried about the potential damage to Sony's corporate relations with these brands". And so replacement cards were used, which feature much of the same information but without reference to any specific companies or people. So how do we know what the original cards said? Because Winterbottom, very much in the viciously sardonic spirit of the film, read them out on-stage after the world première in Toronto! Kline, who was in the audience, was far from impressed, which may account for the shoddy advertising campaign, with the film being released into theatres with virtually no market awareness. Whatever the case, Kline seems unaware of the irony of his actions - in relation to a film which accuses the rich of all manner of shenanigans to insulate and protect themselves and their fortunes, a massive corporate entity has exerted its authority to protect other massive corporate entities. It's like something McCreadie himself would do.\n\nAesthetically, the film employs a plethora of techniques, including non-linear editing, direct-to-camera addresses, YouTube videos to provide exposition, split-screen, fake news footage, and title cards. However, it's at its most effective when at its simplest, particularly in scenes involving the wonderful Dinita Gohil as McCreadie's overworked, under-appreciated PA. Amanda's interactions with Nick provide the emotional core of the story, and there's nothing bombastic or ostentatious about their construction - it's all simple shot/counter-shot editing and blocking. And by far the film's best sequence, which comes towards the end, is another simple setup involving Amanda and McCreadie, wherein the scene tells its story not through aesthetic construction or even through dialogue, but through the expression on Gohil's face. It's the moment during which Winterbottom drops all pretence of comedy and focuses on the more serious issues that have hovered at the fringes since the opening seconds.\n\nIf I were to focus on any one problem, it would be two underdeveloped subplots. A (staged) reality TV show subplot involving McCreadie's daughter Lily (Sophie Cookson) provides for some very funny individual moments, but it contributes nothing whatsoever to the main plot. Additionally, the fact that McCreadie and his ex-wife Samantha (Isla Fisher) are still in love with one another is a theme which never really goes anywhere, which is a shame, as it could have provided some much-needed character development for her and some shades of grey for him.\n\nFor better or worse, we live in an age where there are more billionaires than ever before, and Greed is a comedy about the excess and disconnect of such people. However, so too is it a cautionary tale, a reminder that just because we're removed from exploitation doesn't mean such exploitation isn't happening.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5829,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-02-21","keywords":"husband wife relationship,fashion industry,fashion show,flashback within a flashback within a flashback,greece","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3277897497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Greed' tells the story of self-made British billionaire Sir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan), whose retail empire is in crisis.

Jennifer Coolidge is still as much a MILF as Stifler's mom while Eugene Levy, the only one to appear in ever single incarnation of these films, continues his signature role of Jim's dad. Even Tara Reid and Mena Suvari are back in the mix.\n\nLoads of ridiculous situations, a disgusting hijink and fantastically hilarious comedy ensues as the gang gets back together, having aged stupendously (Klein's body has gotten even more porn-worthy) and making this long-awaited return well worth the time and effort.

It's an explosive, action-packed ride from the glorious opening sequence through the ending, maintaining some level of (surprisingly effective) humor which was mostly included because the script was written, or edited, for Pierce Brosnan, who would only finally take over the role in 1995 for "Goldeneye", but largely disposing of the silliness and tackiness of the Moore era, and creating a stealthy, thrilling, effective, and ruthless Bond. Dalton makes a terrific Bond, even competing with Connery for the 'definitive' title as far as movie Bond portrayals go, although Dalton is closer to Fleming's Bond than Connery. After the ultra-suave Roger Moore Bond, Dalton's Bond seems almost mean-spirited in comparison, there may be one-liners, but this guy at least seems fit to be a secret agent.\n\nThe action scenes in "The Living Daylights" are all great. I can't think of one which I disliked, and the special effects might be the in the series up to this point. The plot here is actually intriguing, and neither too convoluted or too thin, and keeps you interested from start to finish. The screenplay is terrific, the best in a Bond film since "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". Maryam d'Abo makes for a wonderful Bond girl in Kara Milovy, one of the smartest and most likable of all of Bond's 'love' interests. I really like Caroline Bliss' Moneypenny as well. How fresh and exciting this is when compared to the previous entry.\n\nI'm honestly hard pressed to find any serious flaws with "The Living Daylights". Some have said that it takes itself too seriously, but I never felt that it did. Sure, it was much more straight-faced than most Bond films, but a film is only taking itself too seriously when it becomes thoroughly ridiculous while maintaining a 'serious' superficial look. I never thought that "The Living Daylights" did this. It, and the follow-up Dalton film "License to Kill" were both relative financial disappointments, mostly because audiences didn't care for Dalton's hard-edged Bond or the fact that the film had actual characters other than Bond, actual real-world stakes, and no silly villains. Then again, "The Living Daylights" did extremely well in comparison to most films that year, and it earned much more than "A View to a Kill" did, so perhaps it is only the lesser "Licence to Kill" that was a disappointment.\n\nHow can you go wrong with a movie this well-shot and well-acted, this well-scripted, and so well-scored by John Barry, which would sadly be his last score for the series? A terrific Bond film with a harder edge than most, and one of the few in the series that remains faithful to the spirit of Fleming's novels.

Pepper as the dumbest thing to happen to Bond's cinematic incarnation, until "Die Another Day" came along, that is. It's blisteringly, unrelentingly, unbelievably stupid from start to finish. Yes, I've heard the defenses: "it's a Bond film, what do you expect?" seems to be a popular one. What's even sadder is that certain people relish this stupidity, and wish that this was how most Bond films were.\n\nI hate to say it, as he is a friendly and intelligent person and based on what those who are properly acquainted with him say, a remarkably professional and careful director, but Roger Spottiswoode's work as director here is poor for the most part, with the exception of the one truly great sequence in the film- the chase scene with Michelle Yeoh tied to Bond on a motorbike (probably thanks to a second-unit director anyway). It's not a confidently directed movie at all, and only looks somewhat good thanks to Robert Elswit's photography.\n\nI wish the direction at least was good, as it is hard to compound how atrocious this script is. The vast majority of the dialogue is among the most ridiculous you've ever heard (no, seriously, take a Michael Bay film and dumb down the worst scene then you've got "Tomorrow Never Dies" for basically its entirety). What's most insulting about this script is that Bond barely features in it. Oh, sure, Bond is present in most scenes, but for all he actually does and says it could have been just about anyone in the scene. He speaks strictly in short sentences the writer thought were witty or clever (boy, was he wrong), or partakes in action scenes.

Pepper as the dumbest thing to happen to Bond's cinematic incarnation, until "Die Another Day" came along, that is. It's blisteringly, unrelentingly, unbelievably stupid from start to finish. Yes, I've heard the defenses: "it's a Bond film, what do you expect?" seems to be a popular one. What's even sadder is that certain people relish this stupidity, and wish that this was how most Bond films were.\n\nI hate to say it, as he is a friendly and intelligent person and based on what those who are properly acquainted with him say, a remarkably professional and careful director, but Roger Spottiswoode's work as director here is poor for the most part, with the exception of the one truly great sequence in the film- the chase scene with Michelle Yeoh tied to Bond on a motorbike (probably thanks to a second-unit director anyway). It's not a confidently directed movie at all, and only looks somewhat good thanks to Robert Elswit's photography.\n\nI wish the direction at least was good, as it is hard to compound how atrocious this script is. The vast majority of the dialogue is among the most ridiculous you've ever heard (no, seriously, take a Michael Bay film and dumb down the worst scene then you've got "Tomorrow Never Dies" for basically its entirety). What's most insulting about this script is that Bond barely features in it. Oh, sure, Bond is present in most scenes, but for all he actually does and says it could have been just about anyone in the scene. He speaks strictly in short sentences the writer thought were witty or clever (boy, was he wrong), or partakes in action scenes. I've always defended Brosnan's Bond, but I realize now that I am defending his better Bond, and not the terribly-written and lazily performed version present in this flick and "Die Another Day".

While the heirs of Albert Broccoli, his daughter Barbara and son-in-law Michael G. Wilson, have done a remarkable job in keeping the series 'fresh', if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication, the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing 'touch' with James Bond, and his world.\n\nAfter an astonishing pre-title sequence, climaxing with Bond being captured by the North Koreans, the film offers a horrendous montage of torture, with Bond only surviving due to a timely prisoner exchange (with an unsympathetic M remarking, "If it had been up to me, you'd have stayed in North Korea...", obviously forgetting that 007 had saved her life in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH). Pierce Brosnan, at fifty, is superb in this sequence, vulnerable yet defiant, and to this point, DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the makings of a first-class Bond entry.\n\nThen Bond jaunts off to find the agent who betrayed him, becoming involved in an investigation involving diamonds, solar power, and a 'too-good-to-be-true' industrialist (smarmy Toby Stephens), and all of the creativity of the opening is lost, with the film becoming an uneasy mix of references to past films and silly, unbelievable situations, sets and gadgets (culminating with an 'Ice Palace' and an 'invisible' Aston Martin).\n\nAs she had won an Oscar prior to filming DIE ANOTHER DAY, sexy Halle Berry, 36, was publicized extensively as Bond's latest leading lady, CIA agent 'Jinx'. Unfortunately, after a spectacular 'rising from the waves' introduction (borrowed from Ursula Andress, in DR. NO), and a few nicely choreographed fights, she spoke...and lost all of her credibility in the role. While much of the problem was certainly in the script, she was never believable as Bond's 'counterpart' in the American intelligence community. On the other hand, Rosamund Pike, 23, was both sexy and duplicitous as British double agent Miranda Frost, as chilly as her name, but capable of igniting under 007's gaze.

While the heirs of Albert Broccoli, his daughter Barbara and son-in-law Michael G. Wilson, have done a remarkable job in keeping the series 'fresh', if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication, the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing 'touch' with James Bond, and his world.\n\nAfter an astonishing pre-title sequence, climaxing with Bond being captured by the North Koreans, the film offers a horrendous montage of torture, with Bond only surviving due to a timely prisoner exchange (with an unsympathetic M remarking, "If it had been up to me, you'd have stayed in North Korea...", obviously forgetting that 007 had saved her life in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH). Pierce Brosnan, at fifty, is superb in this sequence, vulnerable yet defiant, and to this point, DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the makings of a first-class Bond entry.\n\nThen Bond jaunts off to find the agent who betrayed him, becoming involved in an investigation involving diamonds, solar power, and a 'too-good-to-be-true' industrialist (smarmy Toby Stephens), and all of the creativity of the opening is lost, with the film becoming an uneasy mix of references to past films and silly, unbelievable situations, sets and gadgets (culminating with an 'Ice Palace' and an 'invisible' Aston Martin).\n\nAs she had won an Oscar prior to filming DIE ANOTHER DAY, sexy Halle Berry, 36, was publicized extensively as Bond's latest leading lady, CIA agent 'Jinx'. Unfortunately, after a spectacular 'rising from the waves' introduction (borrowed from Ursula Andress, in DR. NO), and a few nicely choreographed fights, she spoke...and lost all of her credibility in the role. While much of the problem was certainly in the script, she was never believable as Bond's 'counterpart' in the American intelligence community. On the other hand, Rosamund Pike, 23, was both sexy and duplicitous as British double agent Miranda Frost, as chilly as her name, but capable of igniting under 007's gaze. In a part equally poorly written, she made far more of her scenes than the writers gave her. \n\nThe most interesting character in the film was certainly Rick Yune, as Graves' 'enforcer', Zao. Charismatic, ruthless, and nearly unstoppable, Zao was nearly a primal force, far more menacing than Graves at his worst.\n\nWhile a sword-fight sequence between Bond and Graves provided a rare film highlight, and certainly ranks as one of the film series' more memorable sequences, much of the rest of the production was silly, with the story set at a break-neck pace to 'hide' the absurdities. The climax, as a solar 'ray' destroyed the minefield between North and South Korea, allowing an 'invasion' to occur, as 007 and Jinx attempted to commandeer the aircraft controlling the 'ray', stands as one of the most ludicrous finales to a Bond film since MOONRAKER.\n\nAlthough DIE ANOTHER DAY would become Pierce Brosnan's highest-grossing Bond, to date, the film, despite heavily promoting Halle Berry's presence, failed to crack the 'Top Ten' box office attractions in the U.S., and disappointed many fans, worldwide.\n\nWith the purchase of MGM by Sony, which has wanted to produce a Bond film for years (the studios were entangled in a legal suit that ended just as DIE began production), surprising changes were in store...CASINO ROYALE, the only Fleming title NOT owned by Eon Productions was named as the next 007 adventure...and Pierce Brosnan was FIRED (a sad finish for an actor who'd worked so hard to make 007 viable in the new millennium!)

This one, You Only Live Twice and DR. No from Sean Connery are really my top three all time favorite James Bond 007 films. This was originally the first James Bond film I saw as a kid. Goldfinger was also my dad's favorite James Bond film and in years it become a cult classic. Even for 53 year old movie it still a classic the best 007 flick. I love it to death, I am enjoying it and I have so much fun watching it. \n\nThis movie has so much action, action, action and more action. Sean Connery does an excellent performance as James Bond 007 I'm a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that even the late Sean Connery is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. Everyone who watched this movie know is a really good Bond movie.\n\nThe reason why is this movie so good: - James Bond has new cool car Aston Martin DB5 build with smoke screen in which can throw a co driver seat out of the car and the revolving licence plate. The car also has other applications such as: 30 calibre machine guns, Tire-shredding blade, Oil smoke and water emitters. Actress Shirley Eaton as the murdered Jill Masterson-" is one of the most enduring images in cinematic history. The girl is painted with gold and dies. Memorable and cool villains like are: Auric Goldfinger and Oddjob ( Goldfinger's second henchman.) Oddjob wears a Sandringham hat with a sharpened steel rim, he is using it as a lethal weapon in the style of a chakram. The movie has great sexy beautiful girls like Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore, Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson and Tania Mallet as Tilly Masterson. Cool dialogues I love it so much.\n\n"Do you expect me to talk? No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" \n\nThis was directed by director Guy Hamilton it was his first James Bond 007 film the first two films were directed by Terence Young in which he directed Thunderball next Bond movie after this one. This movie also didn't evolve around SPECTRE this time like was in the first two film it was about a brilliant mastermind criminal in which he planed to blow off Fort Knox to get more profits for his Gold brilliant! It has beautiful great music score by John Barry I love it. The car Aston Martin DB5 James Bond 007 was driving was so cool, it has so many accessories it was beautiful to watch it.\n\nInvestigating a gold magnate's smuggling, James Bond uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve.\n\nThis movie has so much impact it is well acted it has great brilliant plot.\n\nGert Fröbe R.I.P was brilliant and excellent as Goldfinger the original villain. He gave his powerful performance as the bad guy from the title of the movie. I love him in this movie.\n\nHarold Sakata R.I.P. as Oddjob was great villain just like Goldfinger, he was really strong and excellent in hand to hand combat. Oddjob and Jaws are two great Bond villains.\n\nHonor Blackman is the first of a long line of James Bond females with patently sexual names And ho could ever forget Shirley Eaton's introduction in the film? She is lying on a chaise longue on the balcony of Goldfinger's Miami Beach hotel suite, attired in black bra and panties, while she observes Mr. Simmons' (Austin Willis) gin hand through binoculars.\n\nWhat more could you ask for? Well, how about a film in which Bond actually *does* something? For the whole 2nd half of this movie he's just a prisoner who fails every attempt to escape, signal his superiors or even deactivate the bomb himself. Even killing Oddjob at the end is ultimately meaningless as he's still trapped in the vault with a bomb he can't disarm until the Army rescues him.\n\nGoldfinger is a 1964 British spy film and the third instalment in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film also stars Honor Blackman as Bond girl Pussy Galore and Gert Fröbe as the title character Auric Goldfinger, along with Shirley Eaton as the iconic Bond girl Jill Masterson. Goldfinger was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and was the first of four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton.\n\n10/10 Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved me has such a great villains and they are both in my top 10 James Bond favorite films. I just love and enjoy watching this film. Goldfinger in my opinion is MILES way better then Daniel Craig's last three films he did. This movie deserves a cult classic status movies like this will never be so good like was Goldfinger. It is quintessential James Bond 007 action cult classic film I love this movie to death it is my number one favorite Sean Connery's James Bond 007 film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":179918,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" \n\nThis was directed by director Guy Hamilton it was his first James Bond 007 film the first two films were directed by Terence Young in which he directed Thunderball next Bond movie after this one. This movie also didn't evolve around SPECTRE this time like was in the first two film it was about a brilliant mastermind criminal in which he planed to blow off Fort Knox to get more profits for his Gold brilliant! It has beautiful great music score by John Barry I love it. The car Aston Martin DB5 James Bond 007 was driving was so cool, it has so many accessories it was beautiful to watch it.\n\nInvestigating a gold magnate's smuggling, James Bond uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve.\n\nThis movie has so much impact it is well acted it has great brilliant plot.\n\nGert Fröbe R.I.P was brilliant and excellent as Goldfinger the original villain. He gave his powerful performance as the bad guy from the title of the movie. I love him in this movie.\n\nHarold Sakata R.I.P. as Oddjob was great villain just like Goldfinger, he was really strong and excellent in hand to hand combat. Oddjob and Jaws are two great Bond villains.\n\nHonor Blackman is the first of a long line of James Bond females with patently sexual names And ho could ever forget Shirley Eaton's introduction in the film? She is lying on a chaise longue on the balcony of Goldfinger's Miami Beach hotel suite, attired in black bra and panties, while she observes Mr. Simmons' (Austin Willis) gin hand through binoculars.\n\nWhat more could you ask for? Well, how about a film in which Bond actually *does* something? For the whole 2nd half of this movie he's just a prisoner who fails every attempt to escape, signal his superiors or even deactivate the bomb himself. Even killing Oddjob at the end is ultimately meaningless as he's still trapped in the vault with a bomb he can't disarm until the Army rescues him.\n\nGoldfinger is a 1964 British spy film and the third instalment in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film also stars Honor Blackman as Bond girl Pussy Galore and Gert Fröbe as the title character Auric Goldfinger, along with Shirley Eaton as the iconic Bond girl Jill Masterson. Goldfinger was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and was the first of four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton.\n\n10/10 Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved me has such a great villains and they are both in my top 10 James Bond favorite films. I just love and enjoy watching this film. Goldfinger in my opinion is MILES way better then Daniel Craig's last three films he did. This movie deserves a cult classic status movies like this will never be so good like was Goldfinger. It is quintessential James Bond 007 action cult classic film I love this movie to death it is my number one favorite Sean Connery's James Bond 007 film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":179918,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Pepper as the dumbest thing to happen to Bond's cinematic incarnation, until "Die Another Day" came along, that is. It's blisteringly, unrelentingly, unbelievably stupid from start to finish.

While the heirs of Albert Broccoli, his daughter Barbara and son-in-law Michael G. Wilson, have done a remarkable job in keeping the series 'fresh', if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication, the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing 'touch' with James Bond, and his world.\n\nAfter an astonishing pre-title sequence, climaxing with Bond being captured by the North Koreans, the film offers a horrendous montage of torture, with Bond only surviving due to a timely prisoner exchange (with an unsympathetic M remarking, "If it had been up to me, you'd have stayed in North Korea...", obviously forgetting that 007 had saved her life in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH). Pierce Brosnan, at fifty, is superb in this sequence, vulnerable yet defiant, and to this point, DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the makings of a first-class Bond entry.\n\nThen Bond jaunts off to find the agent who betrayed him, becoming involved in an investigation involving diamonds, solar power, and a 'too-good-to-be-true' industrialist (smarmy Toby Stephens), and all of the creativity of the opening is lost, with the film becoming an uneasy mix of references to past films and silly, unbelievable situations, sets and gadgets (culminating with an 'Ice Palace' and an 'invisible' Aston Martin).\n\nAs she had won an Oscar prior to filming DIE ANOTHER DAY, sexy Halle Berry, 36, was publicized extensively as Bond's latest leading lady, CIA agent 'Jinx'. Unfortunately, after a spectacular 'rising from the waves' introduction (borrowed from Ursula Andress, in DR.

While the heirs of Albert Broccoli, his daughter Barbara and son-in-law Michael G. Wilson, have done a remarkable job in keeping the series 'fresh', if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication, the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing 'touch' with James Bond, and his world.\n\nAfter an astonishing pre-title sequence, climaxing with Bond being captured by the North Koreans, the film offers a horrendous montage of torture, with Bond only surviving due to a timely prisoner exchange (with an unsympathetic M remarking, "If it had been up to me, you'd have stayed in North Korea...", obviously forgetting that 007 had saved her life in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH). Pierce Brosnan, at fifty, is superb in this sequence, vulnerable yet defiant, and to this point, DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the makings of a first-class Bond entry.\n\nThen Bond jaunts off to find the agent who betrayed him, becoming involved in an investigation involving diamonds, solar power, and a 'too-good-to-be-true' industrialist (smarmy Toby Stephens), and all of the creativity of the opening is lost, with the film becoming an uneasy mix of references to past films and silly, unbelievable situations, sets and gadgets (culminating with an 'Ice Palace' and an 'invisible' Aston Martin).\n\nAs she had won an Oscar prior to filming DIE ANOTHER DAY, sexy Halle Berry, 36, was publicized extensively as Bond's latest leading lady, CIA agent 'Jinx'. Unfortunately, after a spectacular 'rising from the waves' introduction (borrowed from Ursula Andress, in DR. NO), and a few nicely choreographed fights, she spoke...and lost all of her credibility in the role. While much of the problem was certainly in the script, she was never believable as Bond's 'counterpart' in the American intelligence community. On the other hand, Rosamund Pike, 23, was both sexy and duplicitous as British double agent Miranda Frost, as chilly as her name, but capable of igniting under 007's gaze.

It's an explosive, action-packed ride from the glorious opening sequence through the ending, maintaining some level of (surprisingly effective) humor which was mostly included because the script was written, or edited, for Pierce Brosnan, who would only finally take over the role in 1995 for "Goldeneye", but largely disposing of the silliness and tackiness of the Moore era, and creating a stealthy, thrilling, effective, and ruthless Bond. Dalton makes a terrific Bond, even competing with Connery for the 'definitive' title as far as movie Bond portrayals go, although Dalton is closer to Fleming's Bond than Connery. After the ultra-suave Roger Moore Bond, Dalton's Bond seems almost mean-spirited in comparison, there may be one-liners, but this guy at least seems fit to be a secret agent.\n\nThe action scenes in "The Living Daylights" are all great. I can't think of one which I disliked, and the special effects might be the in the series up to this point. The plot here is actually intriguing, and neither too convoluted or too thin, and keeps you interested from start to finish. The screenplay is terrific, the best in a Bond film since "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". Maryam d'Abo makes for a wonderful Bond girl in Kara Milovy, one of the smartest and most likable of all of Bond's 'love' interests. I really like Caroline Bliss' Moneypenny as well. How fresh and exciting this is when compared to the previous entry.\n\nI'm honestly hard pressed to find any serious flaws with "The Living Daylights". Some have said that it takes itself too seriously, but I never felt that it did. Sure, it was much more straight-faced than most Bond films, but a film is only taking itself too seriously when it becomes thoroughly ridiculous while maintaining a 'serious' superficial look. I never thought that "The Living Daylights" did this. It, and the follow-up Dalton film "License to Kill" were both relative financial disappointments, mostly because audiences didn't care for Dalton's hard-edged Bond or the fact that the film had actual characters other than Bond, actual real-world stakes, and no silly villains. Then again, "The Living Daylights" did extremely well in comparison to most films that year, and it earned much more than "A View to a Kill" did, so perhaps it is only the lesser "Licence to Kill" that was a disappointment.\n\nHow can you go wrong with a movie this well-shot and well-acted, this well-scripted, and so well-scored by John Barry, which would sadly be his last score for the series? A terrific Bond film with a harder edge than most, and one of the few in the series that remains faithful to the spirit of Fleming's novels. A contender for my favorite Bond film and among my favorite action films overall. \n\n9/10"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92993,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1987-06-30","keywords":"soviet afghanistan war,defection,betrayal,soviet general,official james bond series","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4162371097","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGUzNDA3YmYtYWNiZS00YjAxLTk3OTEtMTM5MWFhMjI2ZjVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGUzNDA3YmYtYWNiZS00YjAxLTk3OTEtMTM5MWFhMjI2ZjVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001096/","name":"Timothy Dalton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001881/","name":"Maryam d'Abo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0469103/","name":"Jeroen Krabbé"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322515/","name":"John Glen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933865/","name":"Michael G.

It's an explosive, action-packed ride from the glorious opening sequence through the ending, maintaining some level of (surprisingly effective) humor which was mostly included because the script was written, or edited, for Pierce Brosnan, who would only finally take over the role in 1995 for "Goldeneye", but largely disposing of the silliness and tackiness of the Moore era, and creating a stealthy, thrilling, effective, and ruthless Bond. Dalton makes a terrific Bond, even competing with Connery for the 'definitive' title as far as movie Bond portrayals go, although Dalton is closer to Fleming's Bond than Connery. After the ultra-suave Roger Moore Bond, Dalton's Bond seems almost mean-spirited in comparison, there may be one-liners, but this guy at least seems fit to be a secret agent.\n\nThe action scenes in "The Living Daylights" are all great. I can't think of one which I disliked, and the special effects might be the in the series up to this point. The plot here is actually intriguing, and neither too convoluted or too thin, and keeps you interested from start to finish. The screenplay is terrific, the best in a Bond film since "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". Maryam d'Abo makes for a wonderful Bond girl in Kara Milovy, one of the smartest and most likable of all of Bond's 'love' interests. I really like Caroline Bliss' Moneypenny as well. How fresh and exciting this is when compared to the previous entry.\n\nI'm honestly hard pressed to find any serious flaws with "The Living Daylights". Some have said that it takes itself too seriously, but I never felt that it did. Sure, it was much more straight-faced than most Bond films, but a film is only taking itself too seriously when it becomes thoroughly ridiculous while maintaining a 'serious' superficial look. I never thought that "The Living Daylights" did this. It, and the follow-up Dalton film "License to Kill" were both relative financial disappointments, mostly because audiences didn't care for Dalton's hard-edged Bond or the fact that the film had actual characters other than Bond, actual real-world stakes, and no silly villains. Then again, "The Living Daylights" did extremely well in comparison to most films that year, and it earned much more than "A View to a Kill" did, so perhaps it is only the lesser "Licence to Kill" that was a disappointment.\n\nHow can you go wrong with a movie this well-shot and well-acted, this well-scripted, and so well-scored by John Barry, which would sadly be his last score for the series? A terrific Bond film with a harder edge than most, and one of the few in the series that remains faithful to the spirit of Fleming's novels. A contender for my favorite Bond film and among my favorite action films overall. \n\n9/10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":92993,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1987-06-30","keywords":"soviet afghanistan war,defection,betrayal,soviet general,official james bond series","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4162371097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGUzNDA3YmYtYWNiZS00YjAxLTk3OTEtMTM5MWFhMjI2ZjVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGUzNDA3YmYtYWNiZS00YjAxLTk3OTEtMTM5MWFhMjI2ZjVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001096/","name":"Timothy Dalton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001881/","name":"Maryam d'Abo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0469103/","name":"Jeroen Krabbé"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322515/","name":"John Glen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933865/","name":"Michael G.

This one, You Only Live Twice and DR. No from Sean Connery are really my top three all time favorite James Bond 007 films. This was originally the first James Bond film I saw as a kid. Goldfinger was also my dad's favorite James Bond film and in years it become a cult classic. Even for 53 year old movie it still a classic the best 007 flick. I love it to death, I am enjoying it and I have so much fun watching it. \n\nThis movie has so much action, action, action and more action. Sean Connery does an excellent performance as James Bond 007 I'm a hard-core James Bond fan. I make no apologies for believing that even the late Sean Connery is the closest thing we've seen to IAN FLEMING's James Bond. Everyone who watched this movie know is a really good Bond movie.\n\nThe reason why is this movie so good: - James Bond has new cool car Aston Martin DB5 build with smoke screen in which can throw a co driver seat out of the car and the revolving licence plate. The car also has other applications such as: 30 calibre machine guns, Tire-shredding blade, Oil smoke and water emitters. Actress Shirley Eaton as the murdered Jill Masterson-" is one of the most enduring images in cinematic history. The girl is painted with gold and dies. Memorable and cool villains like are: Auric Goldfinger and Oddjob ( Goldfinger's second henchman.) Oddjob wears a Sandringham hat with a sharpened steel rim, he is using it as a lethal weapon in the style of a chakram. The movie has great sexy beautiful girls like Honor Blackman as Pussy Galore, Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson and Tania Mallet as Tilly Masterson. Cool dialogues I love it so much.\n\n"Do you expect me to talk? No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" \n\nThis was directed by director Guy Hamilton it was his first James Bond 007 film the first two films were directed by Terence Young in which he directed Thunderball next Bond movie after this one. This movie also didn't evolve around SPECTRE this time like was in the first two film it was about a brilliant mastermind criminal in which he planed to blow off Fort Knox to get more profits for his Gold brilliant! It has beautiful great music score by John Barry I love it. The car Aston Martin DB5 James Bond 007 was driving was so cool, it has so many accessories it was beautiful to watch it.\n\nInvestigating a gold magnate's smuggling, James Bond uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve.\n\nThis movie has so much impact it is well acted it has great brilliant plot.\n\nGert Fröbe R.I.P was brilliant and excellent as Goldfinger the original villain. He gave his powerful performance as the bad guy from the title of the movie. I love him in this movie.\n\nHarold Sakata R.I.P. as Oddjob was great villain just like Goldfinger, he was really strong and excellent in hand to hand combat. Oddjob and Jaws are two great Bond villains.\n\nHonor Blackman is the first of a long line of James Bond females with patently sexual names And ho could ever forget Shirley Eaton's introduction in the film? She is lying on a chaise longue on the balcony of Goldfinger's Miami Beach hotel suite, attired in black bra and panties, while she observes Mr. Simmons' (Austin Willis) gin hand through binoculars.\n\nWhat more could you ask for? Well, how about a film in which Bond actually *does* something? For the whole 2nd half of this movie he's just a prisoner who fails every attempt to escape, signal his superiors or even deactivate the bomb himself. Even killing Oddjob at the end is ultimately meaningless as he's still trapped in the vault with a bomb he can't disarm until the Army rescues him.\n\nGoldfinger is a 1964 British spy film and the third instalment in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film also stars Honor Blackman as Bond girl Pussy Galore and Gert Fröbe as the title character Auric Goldfinger, along with Shirley Eaton as the iconic Bond girl Jill Masterson. Goldfinger was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and was the first of four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton.\n\n10/10 Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved me has such a great villains and they are both in my top 10 James Bond favorite films. I just love and enjoy watching this film. Goldfinger in my opinion is MILES way better then Daniel Craig's last three films he did. This movie deserves a cult classic status movies like this will never be so good like was Goldfinger. It is quintessential James Bond 007 action cult classic film I love this movie to death it is my number one favorite Sean Connery's James Bond 007 film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":179918,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!" \n\nThis was directed by director Guy Hamilton it was his first James Bond 007 film the first two films were directed by Terence Young in which he directed Thunderball next Bond movie after this one. This movie also didn't evolve around SPECTRE this time like was in the first two film it was about a brilliant mastermind criminal in which he planed to blow off Fort Knox to get more profits for his Gold brilliant! It has beautiful great music score by John Barry I love it. The car Aston Martin DB5 James Bond 007 was driving was so cool, it has so many accessories it was beautiful to watch it.\n\nInvestigating a gold magnate's smuggling, James Bond uncovers a plot to contaminate the Fort Knox gold reserve.\n\nThis movie has so much impact it is well acted it has great brilliant plot.\n\nGert Fröbe R.I.P was brilliant and excellent as Goldfinger the original villain. He gave his powerful performance as the bad guy from the title of the movie. I love him in this movie.\n\nHarold Sakata R.I.P. as Oddjob was great villain just like Goldfinger, he was really strong and excellent in hand to hand combat. Oddjob and Jaws are two great Bond villains.\n\nHonor Blackman is the first of a long line of James Bond females with patently sexual names And ho could ever forget Shirley Eaton's introduction in the film? She is lying on a chaise longue on the balcony of Goldfinger's Miami Beach hotel suite, attired in black bra and panties, while she observes Mr. Simmons' (Austin Willis) gin hand through binoculars.\n\nWhat more could you ask for? Well, how about a film in which Bond actually *does* something? For the whole 2nd half of this movie he's just a prisoner who fails every attempt to escape, signal his superiors or even deactivate the bomb himself. Even killing Oddjob at the end is ultimately meaningless as he's still trapped in the vault with a bomb he can't disarm until the Army rescues him.\n\nGoldfinger is a 1964 British spy film and the third instalment in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, starring Sean Connery as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. It is based on the novel of the same name by Ian Fleming. The film also stars Honor Blackman as Bond girl Pussy Galore and Gert Fröbe as the title character Auric Goldfinger, along with Shirley Eaton as the iconic Bond girl Jill Masterson. Goldfinger was produced by Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman and was the first of four Bond films directed by Guy Hamilton.\n\n10/10 Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved me has such a great villains and they are both in my top 10 James Bond favorite films. I just love and enjoy watching this film. Goldfinger in my opinion is MILES way better then Daniel Craig's last three films he did. This movie deserves a cult classic status movies like this will never be so good like was Goldfinger. It is quintessential James Bond 007 action cult classic film I love this movie to death it is my number one favorite Sean Connery's James Bond 007 film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":179918,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1964-09-20","keywords":"official james bond series,gold,aston martin,race against time,british secret service","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Goldfinger","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2383218457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQ4NDI5YTEtZGMzMS00ZmM3LWI0YzctYWQ5OWIzYjc3MGYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Goldfinger","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002085/","name":"Gert Fröbe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000303/","name":"Honor Blackman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214989/","name":"Paul Dehn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Dalton makes a terrific Bond, even competing with Connery for the 'definitive' title as far as movie Bond portrayals go, although Dalton is closer to Fleming's Bond than Connery.

I never thought that "The Living Daylights" did this. It, and the follow-up Dalton film "License to Kill" were both relative financial disappointments, mostly because audiences didn't care for Dalton's hard-edged Bond or the fact that the film had actual characters other than Bond, actual real-world stakes, and no silly villains.

Everyone knows that Knight Rider is about an ex-cop with a new identity, working for a private foundation that provides him with an indestructible super car. But if you read some of the reviews here, you might think that Knight Rider is the worst TV show that was ever made. Knight Rider could get corny at times but it was nowhere near as terrible as some people say it is. There's nothing at all wrong with a show being campy.\n\nKnight Rider wasn't "all about a cool car" either. If that was true then why didn't the two attempts to revive the show in the 90s work? Knight Rider 2000 in the early 90s and Team Knight Rider in the late 90s both failed to recapture the 80s glory of the original. Team Knight Rider even had 5 talking super vehicles. That proves that there was something to David Hasselhoff (Michael Knight), William Daniels (voice of KITT) and Edward Mulhare (Devon). They had a special chemistry that made the series work. David Hasselhoff for all his William Shatner overacting antics, made the show work too. Another man might have tried to play the material seriously, but the Hoff knew better. Knight Rider wasn't a show that was trying to change the world, it was merely a one hour action/adventure block of entertainment. The people slamming Knight Rider were probably too old to appreciate the show as children in the 80s, or they are too young to have been around in the 80s. I bet a lot of these mean spirited comments are from some dopey Generation Y kids born in 1989 or something like that. I think the shows success speaks for itself.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31809,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1982-09-26","keywords":"vehicle driving by itself,private detective,crime fighter,pontiac trans am,1980s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001327/","name":"David Hasselhoff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0611811/","name":"Edward Mulhare","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000865/","name":"Richard Basehart"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088140/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488991/","name":"Glen A.

For every one intelligent, caring episode comes four or five exercises in downbeat, melodramatic soap opera which sap all the energy out of the show's still-present technical mastery. This four-disc set is a welcome flashback to the show's humble beginnings, when it wasn't supposed to be the most heart-pounding show on television, and succeeded on will, not on hype.\n\nThe central characters in the first season are Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), ER Residents Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) and pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney), Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), Surgical Resident Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq la Salle) and his protégé, third-year med student John Carter (Noah Wyle, the only actor to remain on the show through the entire run). They brought a fresh edge to the oft-repeated world of medical drama, helped greatly by the first television show, in my estimation, to ever put actual intelligence into the presentation. On ER, the cameras move, the people move, the consistent hustle and bustle of an actual environment is palpable, and not simply a setpiece. It's interesting to note that although the show was never broadcast in widescreen until 2001, in the middle of it's seventh season, these first episodes are all presented in the wider format. At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.\n\nStandout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.\n\nThe show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism. This is exaggerated a little, but still a valid point; rarely an episode goes by without something in the line of an unexpected pregnancy, a suicide attempt, a violent skirmish between doctor and patient, or (in one outrageous case) a 12-year old gang member brining his Glock into a trauma room to try and finish another 12-year old off. Still, the show displayed remarkable resilience in almost always rising to become greater than the sum of its parts. Naturally, that ability has waned and virtually disappeared, but these episodes are no less enjoyable as a result of that."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1994-09-19","keywords":"hospital,emergency room,sleeping,medical care,medical doctor","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000381/","name":"Anthony Edwards"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000523/","name":"Julianna Margulies"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093758/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037310/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Er: Season 15","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2463087897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Er: Season 15"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

How in the world can three quarters of the main cast be just nixed like that? Something more than people just "moving on" to better things is going on, I think.\n\nYeah, Reuben's character can be written off easily based on the season one finale, but dropping Machado and McDermott like lead balloons is very sketchy. Even the storyline for Reuben was a stretch since there was a sub-plot pertaining to her personal life (ie.

How in the world can three quarters of the main cast be just nixed like that? Something more than people just "moving on" to better things is going on, I think.\n\nYeah, Reuben's character can be written off easily based on the season one finale, but dropping Machado and McDermott like lead balloons is very sketchy. Even the storyline for Reuben was a stretch since there was a sub-plot pertaining to her personal life (ie. Rick Fox guest-starring) that was developing.\n\nI enjoyed season one immensely because the acting was believable, the chemistry was there, and the writing/directing was top-notch. I'll give season two a chance with new-comers Vivica A. Fox and the rest, but when there are major changes to an already quality cast, usually it's not for the better.

A gang of teenagers (mostly black but from other ethnic groups too) rob a woman/nurse on her way home. A sudden explosion and something falling from the sky, allow the woman to escape. When the gang's leader checks what happened is attacked by an extraterrestrial creature. The group kills the thing and take the body with them hoping to make a few squids out of the strange creature. From there, things get really ugly; when more bigger beasts fall from the sky, police and some gangsters show up; everybody pursuing the gang. The action does not stop.

A gang of teenagers (mostly black but from other ethnic groups too) rob a woman/nurse on her way home. A sudden explosion and something falling from the sky, allow the woman to escape. When the gang's leader checks what happened is attacked by an extraterrestrial creature. The group kills the thing and take the body with them hoping to make a few squids out of the strange creature. From there, things get really ugly; when more bigger beasts fall from the sky, police and some gangsters show up; everybody pursuing the gang. The action does not stop. No unnecessary romances, or tear breaking scenes; just a few commentaries about life in those marginal neighborhoods. The acting of the teenage members is excellent. Every one of them has a brief time to deploy their character but all of them have enough charisma to succeed.

For every one intelligent, caring episode comes four or five exercises in downbeat, melodramatic soap opera which sap all the energy out of the show's still-present technical mastery. This four-disc set is a welcome flashback to the show's humble beginnings, when it wasn't supposed to be the most heart-pounding show on television, and succeeded on will, not on hype.\n\nThe central characters in the first season are Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), ER Residents Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) and pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney), Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), Surgical Resident Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq la Salle) and his protégé, third-year med student John Carter (Noah Wyle, the only actor to remain on the show through the entire run). They brought a fresh edge to the oft-repeated world of medical drama, helped greatly by the first television show, in my estimation, to ever put actual intelligence into the presentation. On ER, the cameras move, the people move, the consistent hustle and bustle of an actual environment is palpable, and not simply a setpiece. It's interesting to note that although the show was never broadcast in widescreen until 2001, in the middle of it's seventh season, these first episodes are all presented in the wider format. At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.\n\nStandout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.\n\nThe show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism. This is exaggerated a little, but still a valid point; rarely an episode goes by without something in the line of an unexpected pregnancy, a suicide attempt, a violent skirmish between doctor and patient, or (in one outrageous case) a 12-year old gang member brining his Glock into a trauma room to try and finish another 12-year old off. Still, the show displayed remarkable resilience in almost always rising to become greater than the sum of its parts. Naturally, that ability has waned and virtually disappeared, but these episodes are no less enjoyable as a result of that.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1994-09-19","keywords":"hospital,emergency room,sleeping,medical care,medical doctor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000381/","name":"Anthony Edwards","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000523/","name":"Julianna Margulies"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093758/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037310/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Er: Season 15","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2463087897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Er: Season 15"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They brought a fresh edge to the oft-repeated world of medical drama, helped greatly by the first television show, in my estimation, to ever put actual intelligence into the presentation. On ER, the cameras move, the people move, the consistent hustle and bustle of an actual environment is palpable, and not simply a setpiece. It's interesting to note that although the show was never broadcast in widescreen until 2001, in the middle of it's seventh season, these first episodes are all presented in the wider format. At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.\n\nStandout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.\n\nThe show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism. This is exaggerated a little, but still a valid point; rarely an episode goes by without something in the line of an unexpected pregnancy, a suicide attempt, a violent skirmish between doctor and patient, or (in one outrageous case) a 12-year old gang member brining his Glock into a trauma room to try and finish another 12-year old off. Still, the show displayed remarkable resilience in almost always rising to become greater than the sum of its parts. Naturally, that ability has waned and virtually disappeared, but these episodes are no less enjoyable as a result of that."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1994-09-19","keywords":"hospital,emergency room,sleeping,medical care,medical doctor","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000381/","name":"Anthony Edwards"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000523/","name":"Julianna Margulies"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093758/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037310/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Er: Season 15","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2463087897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Er: Season 15"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Naturally, that ability has waned and virtually disappeared, but these episodes are no less enjoyable as a result of that.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1994-09-19","keywords":"hospital,emergency room,sleeping,medical care,medical doctor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000381/","name":"Anthony Edwards","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000523/","name":"Julianna Margulies"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093758/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037310/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Er: Season 15","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2463087897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Er: Season 15"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's an engaging, non-commercial Sci-fi film that is well acted, directed and produced. It held my attention and made me want to find out the fate of the ship and crew.\n\nI knew nothing of the poem. I knew nothing other than what the trailer contained. It is incredibly difficult to adapt a poem which is tied more than any other literary form to the word, into a mostly visual medium. Since the screenwriter seemed to jettison the words of the poem what we are left with is an outline. That's where some problems begin. The poem was written in 1956, when space travel hadn't even started. So, it's pretty lame when a space ship the size of the Aniara doesn't have redundant power and a number of backup plans for when/if things go wrong. But hey, we're already in outer space, disbelief is suspended, so, shut the hell up. There's a bunch character driven scenes but none of character ever develop.

Also Instead of a fully developed story we get inundated with a series of let downs which really come off as more of a drag than tragic. I mean would it really be that bad to be traveling through space? The filmmakers certainly seem sure it is. There's some poignant moments throughout, to be sure. The problem is it's all for a movie that just peters out. What may have had great resonance on the page doesn't make it through the translation to screen.\n\nI think if they had stronger conclusion to what happens to the main character at the end the movie would've worked better. That way the ultimate ending would've become a post script.
