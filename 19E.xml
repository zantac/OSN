This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15651,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.\n\nThe thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.\n\nAlso all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).\n\nThe reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. \n\n9 out of 10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-09-20","keywords":"shared universe,ampersand in title,punctuation in title,sexually motivated,sexually motivated assault","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002127/","name":"Mariska Hargitay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005221/","name":"Christopher Meloni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001384/","name":"Ice-T"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069685/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080319/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3079995673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The film expressively reminds the world once again about the illicit affair between Caroline Mathilde (Alicia Vikander), the beautiful Queen of Denmark, and the enlightened, German-born physician named Johann Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen). In all its courtly essence, A Royal Affair presents this 18th century tale with utmost thoroughness, adding huge amounts of tension to its naturalistic substance with every following minute. While it's mostly recognized for the meaningful romantic overtone, this film presents much more than that, even though the star-crossed lovers prove to have the biggest impact on the unexpected turn of events. \n\nIt starts very similarly to Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, with a young princess bound to marry a king she doesn't even know, through the old-fashioned way of a royal transaction. Right after the Queen finally sets her lovely eyes on the mysterious husband-to-be one thing is certain – there is something wrong with his majestic appearance. Christian VII (Mikkel Boe Følsgaard) giggles nervously, and is more interested in greeting his own dog than the woman, with whom he will probably (but not likely) spend the rest of his palace life. Right after the both absolutely awkward and truly humorous announcement of King's nightly visit in his wife's bedroom, and Caroline's anxiously awaited pregnancy, it becomes perfectly clear that the pair won't present itself in the expected, regal way. Those two characters don't even intend to give the appearance of being fully in love with each other. The king wanders angrily around the luxurious chambers making fun of everyone, not knowing that he ostentatiously presents all of his biggest weaknesses. At the same time, the Queen spends most of her time with the newborn baby. When Christian proclaims his forthcoming trip around Europe nobody realizes that big and sudden changes are about to happen. During the journey King's mental illness becomes worse. He needs a private doctor and he needs him quick. This is the moment when Johan Struensee first shows his handsome face. Apart from his unquestionable medical abilities, he proves to be a great admirer of the Enlightenment movement's greatest thinkers and their innovative works, and that's what makes him an ideal partner for the King. After returning to the country, their companionship grows stronger every day. Unfortunately, so does Johan's affection towards Queen's awe-inspiring persona. After a while, it becomes awfully obvious that they won't be able to suppress their deepest urges and a risky romance will soon take place, one that might actually begin a new era in the history of Denmark. Scheming behind the back of the wig-wearing, ignorant council, Caroline and Struensee use the gullible King for the sake of a greater good – they create many new and reformative laws, and using Christian's powerful, yet unstable hand they end up improving the whole land and its citizens' life, rushing Denmark towards the desired Enlightenment.\n\nAs history so often shows, when there is the optimistic, hard-working side there must also be the pessimistic, mischievous one. In A Royal Affair, it takes the form of an ominous, recalcitrant aristocrat named Ove Høegh-Guldberg (David Dencik). Conspiring along with Christian's stepmother Juliane Marie (Trine Dyrholm) he comes up with a perfect plan to get rid of the unwanted German and, at the same time, bring back Denmark's old 'glory'. Revealing the shocking truth about Queen being pregnant with Struensee he wreaks havoc among the society. The return of the Dark Ages is upon Denmark, and no one is able to stop this devastating process, as the King gave in to Ove's strong and convincing character, and, ultimately, to his own illness. Johann and Caroline are banished from the Kingdom, just to see that, sadly, their thorough plan wasn't actually meant to help anyone.\n\nWith its splendidly high entertainment value, A Royal Affair turns out to be a history lesson for everyone. Considerable attention to details in plot and in art design brings out the true substance of the film. The costumes are pitch-perfect, the music flows adequately to the events, and the ongoing transition in the atmosphere intensifies the reception of the whole. A Royal Affair possesses a great energy, which shows its true strength in all the performances. Without offending anyone from the amazing cast, it's important to note that Mads Mikkelsen gave the most award-worthy performance, showing the straightforwardly persuasive impassiveness that may really convince his fans and anti-fans alike. Therefore, those irrefutable acting skills, combined with a well-written script and steady direction, make A Royal Affair one of the most memorable Danish movies of the last decade.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45765,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2012-03-29","keywords":"infidelity,insanity,denmark,enlightenment,sex in public","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1020634393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzcyOTg0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg3NzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkxMzcyOTg0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjg3NzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young queen, who is married to an insane king, falls secretly in love with her physician - and together they start a revolution that changes a nation forever.

The film expressively reminds the world once again about the illicit affair between Caroline Mathilde (Alicia Vikander), the beautiful Queen of Denmark, and the enlightened, German-born physician named Johann Struensee (Mads Mikkelsen). In all its courtly essence, A Royal Affair presents this 18th century tale with utmost thoroughness, adding huge amounts of tension to its naturalistic substance with every following minute. While it's mostly recognized for the meaningful romantic overtone, this film presents much more than that, even though the star-crossed lovers prove to have the biggest impact on the unexpected turn of events. \n\nIt starts very similarly to Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette, with a young princess bound to marry a king she doesn't even know, through the old-fashioned way of a royal transaction. Right after the Queen finally sets her lovely eyes on the mysterious husband-to-be one thing is certain – there is something wrong with his majestic appearance. Christian VII (Mikkel Boe Følsgaard) giggles nervously, and is more interested in greeting his own dog than the woman, with whom he will probably (but not likely) spend the rest of his palace life. Right after the both absolutely awkward and truly humorous announcement of King's nightly visit in his wife's bedroom, and Caroline's anxiously awaited pregnancy, it becomes perfectly clear that the pair won't present itself in the expected, regal way. Those two characters don't even intend to give the appearance of being fully in love with each other. The king wanders angrily around the luxurious chambers making fun of everyone, not knowing that he ostentatiously presents all of his biggest weaknesses. At the same time, the Queen spends most of her time with the newborn baby. When Christian proclaims his forthcoming trip around Europe nobody realizes that big and sudden changes are about to happen. During the journey King's mental illness becomes worse. He needs a private doctor and he needs him quick. This is the moment when Johan Struensee first shows his handsome face. Apart from his unquestionable medical abilities, he proves to be a great admirer of the Enlightenment movement's greatest thinkers and their innovative works, and that's what makes him an ideal partner for the King. After returning to the country, their companionship grows stronger every day. Unfortunately, so does Johan's affection towards Queen's awe-inspiring persona. After a while, it becomes awfully obvious that they won't be able to suppress their deepest urges and a risky romance will soon take place, one that might actually begin a new era in the history of Denmark.

I really like the soundtrack too. However, the story quickly becomes implausible, but it is still entertaining to watch. This film has a big budget, and hence has helicopters, nice hotels, classical mansions. Even if the story is less than perfect, it is still pleasing to watch. Though this film is a little lousy, but it is still watchable for some brain off entertainment. I think this film deserves higher points than a 3.6."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-03-05","keywords":"mission","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002010/","name":"Christian Clavier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000809/","name":"Daniel Auteuil"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0766837/","name":"Jennifer Saunders"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0207640/","name":"Vincent De Brus"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044473/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0207640/","name":"Vincent De Brus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501548/","name":"Arnaud Lemort"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5496614/","name":"Declan May"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I really like the soundtrack too. However, the story quickly becomes implausible, but it is still entertaining to watch. This film has a big budget, and hence has helicopters, nice hotels, classical mansions. Even if the story is less than perfect, it is still pleasing to watch. Though this film is a little lousy, but it is still watchable for some brain off entertainment. I think this film deserves higher points than a 3.6.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-03-05","keywords":"mission","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002010/","name":"Christian Clavier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000809/","name":"Daniel Auteuil","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0766837/","name":"Jennifer Saunders"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0207640/","name":"Vincent De Brus"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044473/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0207640/","name":"Vincent De Brus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501548/","name":"Arnaud Lemort","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5496614/","name":"Declan May"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The subtitles (the show is in Hebrew) don't detract at all from the intense suspense.\n\nThis totally engrossing thriller - all without any violence so far - is compelling even in a theater, and I'll watch compulsively streaming or on TV. After two episodes, all we have is mysteries, so the eight-episode season holds great promise.\n\nNo wonder they say the Israeli originals are better!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1302,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-29","keywords":"reference to qasem soleimani,islamic revolutionary guard corps,iran israel relations,anti semitic ideology,radical islam","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2270626/","name":"Angel Bonanni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1502238/","name":"Moris Cohen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1573064/","name":"Miki Leon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068002/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0387244/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1038269/","name":"Maria Feldman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436557/","name":"Leora Kamenetzky","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3679827/","name":"Amit Cohen"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Eté 85 is a mixture of Ozon and a try to mimic Almadóvar's way of looking into tragedy, which unfortunately fails completely. The scenes are great, the actors true to their characters, but what comes out is a story swaying between a kitsch gay teenagers' love affair and a family drama. The ending is weird (I am referring to the court sentence), taking into account the fact that the subject of homosexuality was at the time socially unacceptable was extremely poorly part of the story to that point, with the exception of a vague reference to an uncle). None of the three main characters (Alexis, David and the mother, Mme Gorman) develop and their reactions throughout the film are irrational, somewhere between funny and stupid, in a combination which simply does not work. Kate's acting is miserable, same as Alexis' parents. The only convincing character, if any, is probably the social worker.\n\nConcluding, this is a mediocre film to watch if you are into gay dramas and have nothing better to do.

He's nowadays as sheriff , Marshal Chris Adams , who turns down a friend's request to help stop the depredations of a band of Mexican bandits , but then his spouse (Mariette Hartley) has been kidnapped by a gang . When his wife is abducted by bank thieves and his friend is murdered capturing the last outlaw , Chris feels obligated to take up his partner's cause . Then Chris along with a journalist (Michael Callan) set off in pursuit bandit gunfighters (Gary Busey among them) , as he recruits five prisoners to track down the desperadoes . Besides , Chris helping his buddy (Ralph Waite) must free a Mexican village (inhabited by women as Stefanie Powers , among others) besieged by nasty outlaws who are devastating the small location . Lee van Cleef is decided to take a group of prisoners and strike a blow against the Mexican bandits . He goes to Tucson Territorial Prison where a bunch of misfits , murderers , robbers , rapists and other prisoners (with a TV star-studded cast such as Pedro Armendariz , Luke Askew, William Lucking, Ed Lauter, and James B. Sikking ) get a chance to redeem themselves . As Chris recruits various Magnificent Men and once again defending hapless people from their oppressors . As a brand of new seven , doing their number , they put their lives on the line and let it ride . \n\nThe last in the original series of four ¨The Magnificent Seven¨ movies , here Lee Van Cleef as Chris , substituting Yul Brynner , who played the role in two occasions , and one performed by George Kennedy .

He's nowadays as sheriff , Marshal Chris Adams , who turns down a friend's request to help stop the depredations of a band of Mexican bandits , but then his spouse (Mariette Hartley) has been kidnapped by a gang . When his wife is abducted by bank thieves and his friend is murdered capturing the last outlaw , Chris feels obligated to take up his partner's cause . Then Chris along with a journalist (Michael Callan) set off in pursuit bandit gunfighters (Gary Busey among them) , as he recruits five prisoners to track down the desperadoes . Besides , Chris helping his buddy (Ralph Waite) must free a Mexican village (inhabited by women as Stefanie Powers , among others) besieged by nasty outlaws who are devastating the small location . Lee van Cleef is decided to take a group of prisoners and strike a blow against the Mexican bandits . He goes to Tucson Territorial Prison where a bunch of misfits , murderers , robbers , rapists and other prisoners (with a TV star-studded cast such as Pedro Armendariz , Luke Askew, William Lucking, Ed Lauter, and James B. Sikking ) get a chance to redeem themselves . As Chris recruits various Magnificent Men and once again defending hapless people from their oppressors . As a brand of new seven , doing their number , they put their lives on the line and let it ride . \n\nThe last in the original series of four ¨The Magnificent Seven¨ movies , here Lee Van Cleef as Chris , substituting Yul Brynner , who played the role in two occasions , and one performed by George Kennedy .

Cheesy, boring epics, usually directed by the likes of Antonio Margheriti that have crummy atmospherics, bad plots and horrible dubbing.\n\nBut "Planet of the Vampires" has something else.

Yumm...\n\nThis beats them by far, and is certainly original in it's execution, in my opinion. The DVD is a vast improvement over the old Thorn/EMI videotape, transferred from a stunning, original master print that has the AIP logo at the beginning of the titles.\n\nI don't think there was really anything that combined both the Sci-Fi element with the horror element before this film.

Cheesy, boring epics, usually directed by the likes of Antonio Margheriti that have crummy atmospherics, bad plots and horrible dubbing.\n\nBut "Planet of the Vampires" has something else. Something mysterious and original that even Ridley Scott would pick up on 15 years later. A little known fact except to viewers of this film.\n\nPlus they got some hot looking Italo-babes in this one. Yumm...\n\nThis beats them by far, and is certainly original in it's execution, in my opinion. The DVD is a vast improvement over the old Thorn/EMI videotape, transferred from a stunning, original master print that has the AIP logo at the beginning of the titles.\n\nI don't think there was really anything that combined both the Sci-Fi element with the horror element before this film.

Not alive, anyway."","reviewBody":"Director Billy Wilder was certainly no stranger to the horrors of World War Two. He was born in Austria-Hungary {now Poland} in 1906, but moved to Berlin to begin a career in movies. However, following the rise of Adolf Hitler, Wilder  being Jewish  fled for Paris and then the United States. His mother, grandmother and stepfather died at the Auschwitz concentration camp. As such, I think it'd be safe to presume that Wilder housed a considerable hatred towards Nazis, which makes his POW-picture, 'Stalag 17 (1953),' all the more remarkable. Whereas the film might have developed into a bleak, depressing drama, the screenplay by Wilder and Edwin Blum {adapted from a play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski} effortlessly blends drama and comedy, clearing the path for other similarly-themed war-time films {David Lean's 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' and John Sturges' 'The Great Escape (1963)'} and even TV series {'Hogan's Heroes (1965-1971)' clearly used Wilder's film as a template  including an identical Sgt. Schulz  despite a failed court case in which producers sued for infringement}.\n\nThe year is 1944, in the week before Christmas. Stalag 17, a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, is situated somewhere along the Danube River, and hundreds of captured Allied sergeants have been imprisoned there. The Americans of Barrack 4 endure a dull, deprived lifestyle, with each day consisting of unwholesome meals, tedious labour and uncomfortable living conditions. Displaying that typical American cleverness and resourcefulness, many of the prisoners have banded together to ensure themselves a few added luxuries  such a makeshift radio to listen to the latest war news  and to build an effective escape tunnel beneath the camp. However, it soon becomes apparent that there is a Nazi spy within their midst. After two escaping prisoners are immediately shot down, and their escape passage is inexplicably discovered, the men turn their suspicions towards J.J. Sefton (William Holden), a selfish and arrogant prisoner with a dog-eat-dog mentality that sees him openly bribing the German guards for luxuries. An unsympathetic character, one who nonetheless exhibits a certain streak of integrity, Sefton decides to uncover the true traitor of Barrack 4.\n\nThough he was reluctant to play such an unlikable character, Holden won the Best Actor Oscar for his powerful performance {via the second-shortest acceptance speech in Academy Awards history  a simple "thank you"}. The other actors in the film also create distinct and likable personalities, and I particularly enjoyed the big, oafish Animal (Robert Strauss) and Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck). Goodness knows what compelled the writers to make Sgt. Schulz (Sig Ruman), a loathsome tyrant in any other film, a jolly and hearty buffoon, but it works absolutely perfectly, his character's incompetence best highlighted in the sequence where he is distracted into playing volleyball, and enjoys the game so much that he hands his loaded weapon to the nearest POW. As Sefton attempts to uncover which fellow prisoner is leaving secret messages for their Nazis captors, Wilder intersperses the drama with an episodic flow of comedic situations, placing particularly emphasis on the means by which prisoners will alleviate their desire for the opposite sex. A hilarious sequence sees the drunken Animal mistaking his dressed-up bunk-mate for the cinema beauty Betty Grable, of whom he has an undying obsession.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1953-06-06","keywords":"prisoner of war camp,world war two,nazi,betting,diversionary tactic","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2917842969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjZkMGI5ZGEtYTNjYy00ZTQxLWFjZGEtMmRhNTljYmFiZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjZkMGI5ZGEtYTNjYy00ZTQxLWFjZGEtMmRhNTljYmFiZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000034/","name":"William Holden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852279/","name":"Don Taylor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695937/","name":"Otto Preminger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089637/","name":"Edwin Blum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0079654/","name":"Donald Bevan"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you want to see why, then watch this picture. Salkow has no sense of pacing whatsoever (a trait even more evident in his "Sitting Bull" from 1954, which has to be among the most disjointed pictures ever made). Stuff happens, then nothing happens for a while, then stuff happens again, then nothing happens for a while again, and so on, and so on, and so on. That describes this picture pretty much to a T, and what's even worse is that, unlike many of Salkow's other westerns, this one actually has a cast of experienced western actors in roles both large and small: James Best, Frank Ferguson, Rex Holman, Rick Vallin, Frank Gerstle and Mort Mills, among others, have done good work in other westerns, and Audie Murphy is earnest as always, but there's not much they can do with this. They try hard, but Salkow's limp direction and the drivel they're forced to recite kill whatever small chances there may have been of making something out of nothing. Even though the plot is somewhat tired, good--or even halfway competent--writing could have made this picture at least watchable. The writing here is laughable hack work, just cliché piled on top of cliché, overheated dramatics, eye-rolling villainy--it seems more like a William S. Hart western from 1915 than an Audie Murphy western from 1964. The last part of the picture picks up a bit--"picks up" being a relative term, considering that virtually nothing has happened up to that point--when the outlaw gang attacks the town, but even that isn't in the least exciting. Salkow's tenuous skills as a filmmaker completely evaporate when the "action" starts (again, check out his 1954 "Sitting Bull") and this picture is no exception--a few desultory gunshots and a bad guy falls off his horse, another gunshot or two and a townsman falls down (it's hard to tell if it's because he was "shot" or if he just dropped from exhaustion--the outlaws and the townsmen in this picture have to be among the OLDEST people to engage in a gun battle in the history of westerns) and the same thing is pretty much repeated for the next eight or ten minutes. There's no sense of excitement, danger, or anything other than boredom. In the end, of course, everything works out exactly as you knew it would, but it's not really worth sitting through this dull, lumbering mess to have your suspicions confirmed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":764,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Western"],"keywords":"gun,gunslinger,guns of the west,horse chase,hotel fight","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001559/","name":"Audie Murphy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0026039/","name":"Merry Anders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0078940/","name":"James Best"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0758508/","name":"Sidney Salkow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139591/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0193427/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448839/","name":"Robert E.

Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay western which managed to keep my interest for the most part.

But even then the odds are not in his favor and when Lobero pulls out at the last minute the chances of success decrease even more. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay western which managed to keep my interest for the most part. Of course, it suffers in comparison to the original film, "The Magnificent Seven" but that probably goes without saying . Be that as it may, I have rated it accordingly. Average.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2660,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Action","Western"],"datePublished":"1969-08-01","keywords":"sonora mexico,one armed gunfighter,two gun holster,gun holster,double gun holster","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001421/","name":"George Kennedy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926235/","name":"James Whitmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0548449/","name":"Monte Markham"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0920862/","name":"Paul Wendkos"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054562/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011112/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0388913/","name":"Herman Hoffman"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Pumping into it a budget reputedly of $2 million, the look and feel is perfect for this macabre observation of vanity, greed and self destruction. In many ways it's still an under valued movie, mainly because there will always be Wilde purists who think it lacks the writer's poetic spikiness, while horror fans quite often venture into the picture expecting some sort of violent classic ripe with sex, drugs and debauchery unbound.\n\nLewin crafts his film in understated manner, never allowing the themes in the source material to become overblown just for dramatic purpose. He cloaks it all with an atmosphere of eeriness, thus keeping the debasing nature of Dorian Gray subdued. The horror aspects here mostly are implied or discussed in elegantly stated conversations, where the horror in fact is purely in the characterisation of Dorian himself. We really don't need to see actual things on screen, we are urged to be chilled to the marrow by his mere presence, and this works because Lewin has personalised us into this man's sinful descent by way of careful pacing and character formation.\n\nThere are some jolt moments of course, notably the famous inserts of Technicolor into the black and white film, the impact of such bringing the portrait of the title thundering into our conscious. However, this is not about thrill rides and titillation, because the film, like its source, is intellectual. Lewin is aided considerably by Stradling's beautiful photography, which in turn either vividly realises the opulent abodes or darkens the dens of iniquities, so just like Lewin, Stradling and the art department work wonders and prove to be fine purveyors of their craft.\n\nHatfield is wonderful, it's an inspired piece of casting, with his angular features and cold dead eyes, he effortlessly suggests the black heart now beating where once there was a soul. Yet even he, and the rest of the impressive cast, are trumped by Sanders as Lord Henry. Cynical, brutal yet rich with witticisms, in Sanders' excellent hands Lord Henry becomes the smiling devil like mentor perched on Dorian's shoulder. Dorian and Lord Henry are movie monsters, proof positive that not all monsters need to be seen hacking off limbs or drinking blood. In this case, the decaying of the soul is a far more terrifying experience.\n\nFascinating, eloquent, intelligent and frightening. 9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12492,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1945-03-03","keywords":"painting,painter,soul,hedonist,deal with the devil","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2741026585","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001695/","name":"George Sanders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0368836/","name":"Hurd Hatfield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001656/","name":"Donna Reed"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0928492/","name":"Oscar Wilde"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A forgotten classic that on second viewing still has the same impact when we saw it at a retrospective of the master's work some time back. Fellini was instrumental in creating this magnificent movie about con men that operated in Italy in the years that followed the end of WWII. Fellini worked on the screen play with his collaborators, Tullio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano; they gave life to all these swindlers and made them human. Nino Rota's music and Otello Martinelli's cinematography compliment the film and make it even better.\n\nFellini was a director that got a lot from his actors, as he shows in "Il Bidone". Working with Broderick Crawford, and again with Richard Basehart, he was able to have both men give excellent performances, especially Mr. Crawford, who looks as though he is nothing but Italian because he convinces us he is the hard man he is portraying.\n\nThe three friends, Augusto, Picasso, and Roberto, go from one scheme to the next, never thinking about who are they stealing from. The best caper occurs at the beginning of the film as the trio arrives at the farm of the two older women with the promise of riches hidden in their land. Mr. Crawford's bishop is perfect. So is the assistant priest of Richard Basehart. Franco Fabrizi is the driver. The solution for getting the money away from the poor women is something not to be believed.\n\nAugusto's life is an empty one. He goes from one job to another trying to outsmart his victims. It's not until Augusto meets his daughter Patrizia by chance, that he begins to feel what might be some remorse for his actions as he notices his beautiful daughter now grown and on her way to making something out of her life. His conscience begins to bother him because he realizes the evil of his ways.\n\nThe other best sequence in the film involves the party at Vargas' house where the swindlers have been invited to celebrate the arrival of the new year. We watch as Iris, Picasso's wife, realizes what her husband and the others are really up to. Roberto, the ladies' man, steals the gold cigarette case, not realizing that he is at the home of another con man and his actions will not go unnoticed, but even the embarrassment he goes through in front of the guests will make him give up his life.\n\n"Il Bidone" is a fine example of the Italian cinema of those years as it shows an artist of the caliber of Federico Fellini in top form. The film will delight people that haven't been exposed to that part of Mr. Fellini's career seldom seen these days.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1955-10-07","keywords":"italy,con man,peasant,new year's eve,nightclub","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002024/","name":"Broderick Crawford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000865/","name":"Richard Basehart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0556399/","name":"Giulietta Masina"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000019/","name":"Federico Fellini"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032224/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005342/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000019/","name":"Federico Fellini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0280919/","name":"Ennio Flaiano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684083/","name":"Tullio Pinelli"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A forgotten classic that on second viewing still has the same impact when we saw it at a retrospective of the master's work some time back. Fellini was instrumental in creating this magnificent movie about con men that operated in Italy in the years that followed the end of WWII. Fellini worked on the screen play with his collaborators, Tullio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano; they gave life to all these swindlers and made them human. Nino Rota's music and Otello Martinelli's cinematography compliment the film and make it even better.\n\nFellini was a director that got a lot from his actors, as he shows in "Il Bidone". Working with Broderick Crawford, and again with Richard Basehart, he was able to have both men give excellent performances, especially Mr. Crawford, who looks as though he is nothing but Italian because he convinces us he is the hard man he is portraying.\n\nThe three friends, Augusto, Picasso, and Roberto, go from one scheme to the next, never thinking about who are they stealing from. The best caper occurs at the beginning of the film as the trio arrives at the farm of the two older women with the promise of riches hidden in their land. Mr. Crawford's bishop is perfect. So is the assistant priest of Richard Basehart. Franco Fabrizi is the driver. The solution for getting the money away from the poor women is something not to be believed.\n\nAugusto's life is an empty one. He goes from one job to another trying to outsmart his victims. It's not until Augusto meets his daughter Patrizia by chance, that he begins to feel what might be some remorse for his actions as he notices his beautiful daughter now grown and on her way to making something out of her life. His conscience begins to bother him because he realizes the evil of his ways.\n\nThe other best sequence in the film involves the party at Vargas' house where the swindlers have been invited to celebrate the arrival of the new year. We watch as Iris, Picasso's wife, realizes what her husband and the others are really up to. Roberto, the ladies' man, steals the gold cigarette case, not realizing that he is at the home of another con man and his actions will not go unnoticed, but even the embarrassment he goes through in front of the guests will make him give up his life.\n\n"Il Bidone" is a fine example of the Italian cinema of those years as it shows an artist of the caliber of Federico Fellini in top form. The film will delight people that haven't been exposed to that part of Mr. Fellini's career seldom seen these days.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1955-10-07","keywords":"italy,con man,peasant,new year's eve,nightclub","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002024/","name":"Broderick Crawford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000865/","name":"Richard Basehart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0556399/","name":"Giulietta Masina"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000019/","name":"Federico Fellini"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032224/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005342/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000019/","name":"Federico Fellini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0280919/","name":"Ennio Flaiano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684083/","name":"Tullio Pinelli"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you want to see why, then watch this picture. Salkow has no sense of pacing whatsoever (a trait even more evident in his "Sitting Bull" from 1954, which has to be among the most disjointed pictures ever made). Stuff happens, then nothing happens for a while, then stuff happens again, then nothing happens for a while again, and so on, and so on, and so on. That describes this picture pretty much to a T, and what's even worse is that, unlike many of Salkow's other westerns, this one actually has a cast of experienced western actors in roles both large and small: James Best, Frank Ferguson, Rex Holman, Rick Vallin, Frank Gerstle and Mort Mills, among others, have done good work in other westerns, and Audie Murphy is earnest as always, but there's not much they can do with this. They try hard, but Salkow's limp direction and the drivel they're forced to recite kill whatever small chances there may have been of making something out of nothing. Even though the plot is somewhat tired, good--or even halfway competent--writing could have made this picture at least watchable. The writing here is laughable hack work, just cliché piled on top of cliché, overheated dramatics, eye-rolling villainy--it seems more like a William S. Hart western from 1915 than an Audie Murphy western from 1964. The last part of the picture picks up a bit--"picks up" being a relative term, considering that virtually nothing has happened up to that point--when the outlaw gang attacks the town, but even that isn't in the least exciting. Salkow's tenuous skills as a filmmaker completely evaporate when the "action" starts (again, check out his 1954 "Sitting Bull") and this picture is no exception--a few desultory gunshots and a bad guy falls off his horse, another gunshot or two and a townsman falls down (it's hard to tell if it's because he was "shot" or if he just dropped from exhaustion--the outlaws and the townsmen in this picture have to be among the OLDEST people to engage in a gun battle in the history of westerns) and the same thing is pretty much repeated for the next eight or ten minutes. There's no sense of excitement, danger, or anything other than boredom. In the end, of course, everything works out exactly as you knew it would, but it's not really worth sitting through this dull, lumbering mess to have your suspicions confirmed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":764,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Western"],"keywords":"gun,gunslinger,guns of the west,horse chase,hotel fight","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001559/","name":"Audie Murphy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0026039/","name":"Merry Anders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0078940/","name":"James Best"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0758508/","name":"Sidney Salkow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139591/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0193427/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0448839/","name":"Robert E.

The addition of Lee Van Cleef also worked well, but in this effort, it's all Clint Eastwood, and while the rest of the cast are nowhere near as interesting, it's all a better watch than anything the Americans were lumping out at the time.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":204200,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There is plenty of suspense in the film and it also shows the inconceivable wickedness of the Nazis. This film tells very effectively the story of a number of people who thwarted Hitler's attempts to produce a war winning weapon.

But, Some Like It Hot is one of those jet planes where you got to tight your seat belt and forget everything else to enjoy the joyride or you would fall off your seat.\n\nI feel casting in a movie is one of the most under discussed elements of movie making amongst general public but it plays a very significant role in the success of a movie and SLIH is the prime example of it. Apart from Jack Lemmon, none of the protagonists were known for their superior acting skills and they would not have made the cut for a Billy Wilder piece. But, in retrospect, who other than Tony Curtis who had a boyish look and at the same time possessed sharp features could have played a saxophone playing woman charmer who could cross dress to be a part of a woman band. You can only get a flawless performance from a bad actor only if he/she is playing himself/herself and that is the exact reason why Marilyn Monroe wows you in every scene of Some Like It Hot. She is playing a dumb, vivacious and vulnerable damsel who can sing, doesn't mind sleeping with a charming guy whenever she gets a chance and then dips herself in a whiskey bottle when left all alone with herself. Jack Lemmon with a broad muscular jawline was surely the one who had a better chance of getting caught as someone not in the right clothes, but that is very small price to pay, as an actor of his caliber was indispensable to the cause of SLIH. He has an amazing sense of timing when it comes to humor; he is almost chaplinesque when it comes to expressions and the confidence with which he delivers his lines puts him right at the top of stack.\n\nI am not sure when was the concept of black humor introduced in the world of cinema, but, SLIH has to be one of the better examples from the old times where black humor is integrated in the comedy. The black humor is there only to make its presence felt and nothing more. Other than that SLIH is a fun filled journey of Gerald (Lemmon) and Joseph (Curtis), two musicians on the run from dangerous Chicago gangsters who are after their lives. They find their safe house in an all-woman band that is off to Florida for a string of performances. This is where they meet the gorgeous Sugar (Marilyn) and try their luck on flattering her. It is all about how Joseph manages to get ahead in the race and Gerald like a true friend tags along without any explaining or pleading by Joseph. This is what makes SLIH sweet. The necessary salt is added to the movie by little moments like women having a party on train, Sugar hiding whiskey in her stocking, Fielding (Joe Brown) hitting on Dalphe (Gerald disguised as a woman) and further complications that set in because of these. What makes this classical comedy special is the fact that it makes you laugh at so many occasions without being slapstick or cheap or using the chaos technique. And when it doesn't make you laugh, it makes you smile. Most importantly, the movie stays with you.\n\nThe manner in which the movie begins, it suddenly makes you wonder - that's too much of real car chasing and shooting for a black and white movie of 40's and then you realize it's done in 1959 and the movie was intentionally produced in black and white. The first scene itself is a cracker and will create a cocktail of emotions, with words like liquor, crime, party, death, music all floating around at the same time. There are plenty of scenes where the camera pans out from one object to another capturing multiple things with different moods and complexion in the same scene and that is a technique which I guess wasn't used quite frequently back then. Make-up job of Curtis and Lemmon is too good for those times and it would have been so important for that to have been correctly done as that is absolutely central to the whole plot. Marilyn's costumes are way modern and she carries them effortlessly.\n\nSome Like It Hot is without any doubt a classic but, probably in no other movie would have the last line played such an important role as in this. The finishing frames where Joe Brown utters the unexpected leave you pleasantly surprised and I am sure it would have had far better impact on the audience 50 years back.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253966,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Comedy","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"1959-03-19","keywords":"sex comedy,comedy of errors,disguise,all girl band,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Some Like It Hot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2371683353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for the classic comedy Some Like It Hot, starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000054/","name":"Marilyn Monroe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000348/","name":"Tony Curtis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000493/","name":"Jack Lemmon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047869/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011112/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224634/","name":"I.A.L.

But, Some Like It Hot is one of those jet planes where you got to tight your seat belt and forget everything else to enjoy the joyride or you would fall off your seat.\n\nI feel casting in a movie is one of the most under discussed elements of movie making amongst general public but it plays a very significant role in the success of a movie and SLIH is the prime example of it. Apart from Jack Lemmon, none of the protagonists were known for their superior acting skills and they would not have made the cut for a Billy Wilder piece. But, in retrospect, who other than Tony Curtis who had a boyish look and at the same time possessed sharp features could have played a saxophone playing woman charmer who could cross dress to be a part of a woman band. You can only get a flawless performance from a bad actor only if he/she is playing himself/herself and that is the exact reason why Marilyn Monroe wows you in every scene of Some Like It Hot. She is playing a dumb, vivacious and vulnerable damsel who can sing, doesn't mind sleeping with a charming guy whenever she gets a chance and then dips herself in a whiskey bottle when left all alone with herself. Jack Lemmon with a broad muscular jawline was surely the one who had a better chance of getting caught as someone not in the right clothes, but that is very small price to pay, as an actor of his caliber was indispensable to the cause of SLIH. He has an amazing sense of timing when it comes to humor; he is almost chaplinesque when it comes to expressions and the confidence with which he delivers his lines puts him right at the top of stack.\n\nI am not sure when was the concept of black humor introduced in the world of cinema, but, SLIH has to be one of the better examples from the old times where black humor is integrated in the comedy. The black humor is there only to make its presence felt and nothing more. Other than that SLIH is a fun filled journey of Gerald (Lemmon) and Joseph (Curtis), two musicians on the run from dangerous Chicago gangsters who are after their lives. They find their safe house in an all-woman band that is off to Florida for a string of performances. This is where they meet the gorgeous Sugar (Marilyn) and try their luck on flattering her. It is all about how Joseph manages to get ahead in the race and Gerald like a true friend tags along without any explaining or pleading by Joseph. This is what makes SLIH sweet. The necessary salt is added to the movie by little moments like women having a party on train, Sugar hiding whiskey in her stocking, Fielding (Joe Brown) hitting on Dalphe (Gerald disguised as a woman) and further complications that set in because of these. What makes this classical comedy special is the fact that it makes you laugh at so many occasions without being slapstick or cheap or using the chaos technique. And when it doesn't make you laugh, it makes you smile. Most importantly, the movie stays with you.\n\nThe manner in which the movie begins, it suddenly makes you wonder - that's too much of real car chasing and shooting for a black and white movie of 40's and then you realize it's done in 1959 and the movie was intentionally produced in black and white. The first scene itself is a cracker and will create a cocktail of emotions, with words like liquor, crime, party, death, music all floating around at the same time. There are plenty of scenes where the camera pans out from one object to another capturing multiple things with different moods and complexion in the same scene and that is a technique which I guess wasn't used quite frequently back then. Make-up job of Curtis and Lemmon is too good for those times and it would have been so important for that to have been correctly done as that is absolutely central to the whole plot. Marilyn's costumes are way modern and she carries them effortlessly.\n\nSome Like It Hot is without any doubt a classic but, probably in no other movie would have the last line played such an important role as in this. The finishing frames where Joe Brown utters the unexpected leave you pleasantly surprised and I am sure it would have had far better impact on the audience 50 years back.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253966,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Comedy","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"1959-03-19","keywords":"sex comedy,comedy of errors,disguise,all girl band,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Some Like It Hot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2371683353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyNjEzMzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzE0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for the classic comedy Some Like It Hot, starring Tony Curtis, Jack Lemmon, and Marilyn Monroe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000054/","name":"Marilyn Monroe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000348/","name":"Tony Curtis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000493/","name":"Jack Lemmon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047869/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011112/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0224634/","name":"I.A.L.

He's also a contractor and furniture business entrepreneur. He's actually a pretty stand-up young man. Adam (Alex Pettyfer) isn't as put together, but his sister wants him to be. So when she ventures out to Xquisite, the all male dance revue, she exclaims "I was hoping it was all a joke." I don't blame her, I thought it was too. Mike responds, "No, but it is pretty funny." He's also right.\n\n"Magic Mike" is indeed about a male strip club. The other strippers and their routines were all very funny. They definitely went too far at times, but I think that was part of the joke. Matthew McConaughey, as the club owner, seemed to be playing a character playing himself. A sort of tongue-in-cheek joke making fun of the types of roles he gets. He was fearless, willing to say or do anything to get the joke. There is something special about an actor like that.\n\nShortly before the release, positive critics reviews started coming out plus the realization that this was directed by Steven Soderbergh. It makes one think that perhaps there is more to this movie than just guys stripping. Well, yes and no. The majority of this movie is about the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers with plenty of scenes for the predominantly female audience to ogle at their dance moves. As expected, that gets annoying quickly.\n\nAlso as expected, the lifestyle that accompanies male strippers involves easy women and drugs, all of which can be bought with a lot of money. Mike tries to stay out of that style of living. He knows what he wants in life and the "proper" way to get it. On the other hand, Adam very much wants the hard-living style; that's exactly where he wants to be in life. This leads to a brilliant sequence, near the end of the film, where Mike is old enough to be passed his quarter-life crisis while Adam is just approaching his. But one is at more of a cross-roads than the other.\n\nI am also assuming that Soderbergh has chosen to direct this just to do something different. Choosing interesting light effects and strange camera angles, just for fun I suppose. This is a genre that is not known for being inventive and I don't think much of his effort was necessary. But the characters and particularly their dichotomies that he added makes the film worth it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134342,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-06-29","keywords":"male stripper,male objectification,male nudity,abs,stripper","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi889627417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDdiNzgzZTMtOTI2YS00NTA5LWJkMTYtZDQ3ZDFmM2EzZGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDdiNzgzZTMtOTI2YS00NTA5LWJkMTYtZDQ3ZDFmM2EzZGQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"Mike, an experienced stripper, takes a younger performer called The Kid under his wing and schools him in the arts of partying, picking up women, and making easy money."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1641117/","name":"Alex Pettyfer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1601397/","name":"Olivia Munn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0380595/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0265102/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332172/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1730221/","name":"Reid Carolin"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I did not know"- passive irresponsible woman confronted to a politically correct young lawyer,her goddaughter, "who anyway was not living through those dark days"."La machine" gave the sordid affair of a girlie's murder a treatment diametrically opposite of that of André Cayatte ,based on the power of the medias and of public opinion .And "le café des Jules",his most accessible movie, depicted a homophobic misogynist world in the enclosed space of a café.\n\nAt 90+,the director has not lost his ambition, and although remaining unsung ,except by the intellectual critics , makes "un soupçon d'amour" an UFO on the feel good scene of the contemporary French cinema .\n\nThe beginning of the movie may be off-putting ,and its rehearsals of Racine's "Andromaque " does not seem to make sense ,although they do as the movie "grows on you" till the unexpected final twist (which for once is thoroughly relevant)\n\nVecchiali casts one of his favorite actresses ,the luminous Marianne Basler ("Rosa La rose"1986 "le cancre" )who shines in every sense of the term in her part of an actress on the top of her game who knows her time of doubt and fear and gives up the role of Andromaque in her colleague's favor -who's also her husband's lover.\n\nOne can wonder why she chooses to be cast as Jeanne Fortier ,"la porteuse de pain" ,an exponential melodrama of the nineteenth century ,in a movie : because this unfortunate victim meets again her son ,after spending time in jail ,unfairly convicted?\n\nOne can only conjecture about this son:he's always coughing and one suspects he's terminally-ill ;never a word is said about it although clues are given to the viewer : the strange meeting with the chemist and his mother, the walk through the cemetary where the actress cannot find her family's grave , the old flame of hers who has become a priest, her schoolteacher who should be retired but was asked by the mayor to carry on with her work at school. When the actress who replaces her as Andromaque (and was panned by the critics and disdained by the audience) comes to visit her ,she tells her boy to play with his toys. She seems to hide him from the world ,perhaps because she's ashamed of him. Or because her career (and her husband's , as one sees in the last scene in which they root out the evil) has taken the best of her?\n\nThe film is dedicated to Douglas Sirk ,the king of the fifties melodramas .","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-09","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1565310489","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNjMzY1NjMtMjgzZC00MTBiLWEzNzItMjQ0MDI3N2ExMDUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNjMzY1NjMtMjgzZC00MTBiLWEzNzItMjQ0MDI3N2ExMDUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059974/","name":"Marianne Basler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0044865/","name":"Fabienne Babe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701354/","name":"Jean-Philippe Puymartin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891580/","name":"Paul Vecchiali"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0487464/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0820303/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891580/","name":"Paul Vecchiali"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I did not know"- passive irresponsible woman confronted to a politically correct young lawyer,her goddaughter, "who anyway was not living through those dark days"."La machine" gave the sordid affair of a girlie's murder a treatment diametrically opposite of that of André Cayatte ,based on the power of the medias and of public opinion .And "le café des Jules",his most accessible movie, depicted a homophobic misogynist world in the enclosed space of a café.\n\nAt 90+,the director has not lost his ambition, and although remaining unsung ,except by the intellectual critics , makes "un soupçon d'amour" an UFO on the feel good scene of the contemporary French cinema .\n\nThe beginning of the movie may be off-putting ,and its rehearsals of Racine's "Andromaque " does not seem to make sense ,although they do as the movie "grows on you" till the unexpected final twist (which for once is thoroughly relevant)\n\nVecchiali casts one of his favorite actresses ,the luminous Marianne Basler ("Rosa La rose"1986 "le cancre" )who shines in every sense of the term in her part of an actress on the top of her game who knows her time of doubt and fear and gives up the role of Andromaque in her colleague's favor -who's also her husband's lover.\n\nOne can wonder why she chooses to be cast as Jeanne Fortier ,"la porteuse de pain" ,an exponential melodrama of the nineteenth century ,in a movie : because this unfortunate victim meets again her son ,after spending time in jail ,unfairly convicted?\n\nOne can only conjecture about this son:he's always coughing and one suspects he's terminally-ill ;never a word is said about it although clues are given to the viewer : the strange meeting with the chemist and his mother, the walk through the cemetary where the actress cannot find her family's grave , the old flame of hers who has become a priest, her schoolteacher who should be retired but was asked by the mayor to carry on with her work at school. When the actress who replaces her as Andromaque (and was panned by the critics and disdained by the audience) comes to visit her ,she tells her boy to play with his toys. She seems to hide him from the world ,perhaps because she's ashamed of him. Or because her career (and her husband's , as one sees in the last scene in which they root out the evil) has taken the best of her?\n\nThe film is dedicated to Douglas Sirk ,the king of the fifties melodramas .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-09","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1565310489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNjMzY1NjMtMjgzZC00MTBiLWEzNzItMjQ0MDI3N2ExMDUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmNjMzY1NjMtMjgzZC00MTBiLWEzNzItMjQ0MDI3N2ExMDUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059974/","name":"Marianne Basler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0044865/","name":"Fabienne Babe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701354/","name":"Jean-Philippe Puymartin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891580/","name":"Paul Vecchiali"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0487464/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0820303/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891580/","name":"Paul Vecchiali"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Of course, there have always been film-makers who have dared to brave this peril, and it is as well that there have been, otherwise we would have been deprived of, for example, Kenneth Branagh's interpretation of "Henry V", which spoke to the eighties just as Laurence Olivier's had spoken to the forties.\n\nGraham Greene's novel "Brighton Rock" was famously adapted for the screen by the Boulting brothers in 1947, and their version is widely regarded as one of the greatest films from the "Golden Age" of the British cinema during the forties and fifties. Rowan Joffé's recent remake has not been universally well-received, particularly by those who believe that nothing can ever compete with its illustrious predecessor. Much as I admire the Boultings' film, however, I have to admit that the newcomer has many virtues of its own.\n\nThe main character is Pinkie Brown, the youthful leader of a gang of thugs whose principal activity is protection racketeering. Early in the film, Pinkie murders Hale, a member of a rival gang, in revenge for the murder by Hale of Pinkie's colleague Kite. (In the original novel and the 1947 film, Hale was a journalist who had been investigating the gang's activities. Another change is the date at which the story takes place; although the novel and original film are both set in the 1930s, this adaptation is set during the Mods and Rockers era of the 1960s).\n\nPinkie tries to cover his tracks by creating a false alibi for himself, which leads to the commission of further crimes and to Pinkie's marriage to Rose, a young waitress who he believes might be in possession of evidence which could send him to the gallows. Pinkie is not in love with Rose, but marries her because at the time the film is set there was a rule of English law that a wife could not give evidence against her husband. The ending is closer to the one Greene wrote in his novel, although Joffé keeps the famous twist which the writer introduced when he produced the 1947 screenplay.\n\nJoffe said that he made the film because, on reading the novel, he "fell absolutely in love with the character of Rose", and the treatment of this character is, in my view, the one area in which the modern film is better than the earlier one. Andrea Riseborough's interpretation of the character- downbeat, dowdy, bespectacled and needy- seems just right for the role. Rose responds to Pinkie's overtures because he is the only person to have shown her any affection, and she is naïve enough to overlook his obvious criminality and not to realise that his affection for her is feigned. Carol Marsh's Rose, however, was rather too glamorous; it was difficult to imagine her as someone lacking in male admirers.\n\nThere are also good performances from two veterans of the British cinema, John Hurt and Helen Mirren. Hurt plays the bookmaker Phil Corkery, who has a more important role in this adaptation than he does in the book. Mirren plays Ida Arnold, the woman whose determination to get at the truth results in Pinkie's downfall. In the 1947 Ida was played by Hermione Baddeley as a blowsy, ageing showgirl and a casual acquaintance of Hale; here she becomes the manageress of the café where Rose works and a close friend of the murdered man.\n\nI was less impressed by Sam Riley who, as Pinkie, lacked the sense of menace and evil which Richard Attenborough brought to the role. At 30, moreover, Riley seemed too old to play a teenager. (Attenborough would have been 24 in 1947, and looked younger). Also, I couldn't see the point of setting the story in the 1960s, as the "Mods and Rockers" element added little, or nothing, to Greene's story. Pinkie's gang, and the rival Colleoni gang, were both part of Brighton's own criminal underworld, whereas the Mods and Rockers were drawn from all over the country, especially London, and merely chose Brighton, and other seaside resorts, as convenient places for their battles.\n\nJoffé has also discarded a lot of the religious content of the original novel. Greene made Ida an atheist whose system of values was based upon secular ideas of "right" and "wrong", as opposed to Pinkie and Rose, both believing Catholics who believed firmly in "good" and "evil". This opposition between two contrasting attitudes to morality was an important theme of the novel, but it is not something dwelt on at length in either film. The 1947 version downplayed Pinkie's religious beliefs, possibly as a concession to Catholics unhappy with the idea of one of their flock being portrayed as a violent criminal, although it did concentrate on Rose's spiritual development. The modern film acknowledges that both Pinkie and Rose are "Romans", but for the most part avoids theological issues and turns Greene's story into the basis for a grim, grey neo-noir type crime thriller. (The 1947 film was set during a sunny summer Bank Holiday; this version appears to have been shot in winter, with Brighton largely deserted by holidaymakers). It is up to the viewer to decide which approach he or she prefers. 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-02-04","keywords":"prayer,spiv,waitress,gang,brighton","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Brighton Rock: International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4823321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDMxNTAwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI5MzIxNA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDMxNTAwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTI5MzIxNA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A waitress with evidence linking a fledging mobster to a murder finds herself seduced by the young criminal."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0727165/","name":"Sam Riley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2057859/","name":"Andrea Riseborough"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000545/","name":"Helen Mirren"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0423626/","name":"Rowan Joffe"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104811/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0423626/","name":"Rowan Joffe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001294/","name":"Graham Greene"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Of course, there have always been film-makers who have dared to brave this peril, and it is as well that there have been, otherwise we would have been deprived of, for example, Kenneth Branagh's interpretation of "Henry V", which spoke to the eighties just as Laurence Olivier's had spoken to the forties.\n\nGraham Greene's novel "Brighton Rock" was famously adapted for the screen by the Boulting brothers in 1947, and their version is widely regarded as one of the greatest films from the "Golden Age" of the British cinema during the forties and fifties. Rowan Joffé's recent remake has not been universally well-received, particularly by those who believe that nothing can ever compete with its illustrious predecessor. Much as I admire the Boultings' film, however, I have to admit that the newcomer has many virtues of its own.\n\nThe main character is Pinkie Brown, the youthful leader of a gang of thugs whose principal activity is protection racketeering. Early in the film, Pinkie murders Hale, a member of a rival gang, in revenge for the murder by Hale of Pinkie's colleague Kite. (In the original novel and the 1947 film, Hale was a journalist who had been investigating the gang's activities. Another change is the date at which the story takes place; although the novel and original film are both set in the 1930s, this adaptation is set during the Mods and Rockers era of the 1960s).\n\nPinkie tries to cover his tracks by creating a false alibi for himself, which leads to the commission of further crimes and to Pinkie's marriage to Rose, a young waitress who he believes might be in possession of evidence which could send him to the gallows.

When they do so despite years of being recycled, it's usually thanks to talent. "Saw" director James Wan found something of promise in "Saw" writer Leigh Whannell's story "Insidious" and the same must've gone for stars Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. Horror films rarely get that infusion of talent, and as such, "Insidious" does not get lost in that dark dimension of forgettable horror.\n\nJosh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) Lambert have moved into a new home with their two young boys and infant girl. Like always, paranormal oddities occur in small doses here and there until one morning they find their son Dalton in a coma. A few months pass and they move Dalton back home. The freaky incidences increase and eventually Renai sees the ghosts. She convinces Josh to move them into a new home, but it gets worse, so they bring in a paranormal expert (Lin Shaye) who provides them with some shocking revelations about the state of their son.\n\nLike "Paranormal Activity" (a film thats producers have credits on this film unsurprisingly), the idea is to mount tension through paranormal phenomena and expert suspense. Wan provides a number of perfect angles and color to achieve the various moods. As much as you've been spooked this way by films before, you can't simply shirk the way the film creeps in — Wan won't have any of it. In fact, nothing here in terms of scare tactics will come as a revelation; many with a higher jumpiness tolerance will likely find it boring in many regards. No gore or horrific images to be found here — "Insidious" does it old school.\n\nOnce Shaye's character Elise and her two employees arrive on scene, the story mutates from paranormal suspense to other-worldly mystery. Elise explains what's going on — something that involves Dalton's soul being lost in a realm called The Further — and now they must rescue him. Whannell constructs an interesting mythology here and the story goes from horror to more of a mystery/thriller with demonic elements. In a sense he borrows from science fiction in establishing the rules of what's going on. It's mostly interesting, but in many instances flat-out weird to the point that horror purists might not like it.\n\nThe best way to describe "Insidious" is first half "Paranormal Activity" and second half something akin to Sam Raimi's "Drag Me To Hell," which equates to a nice balance between self-seriousness and horror fun. The "X" factor would be the performances. Byrne keeps Renai from becoming an obnoxious scaredy cat as her role's importance dwindles in the latter half of the film, in which time she still keeps Renai relevant. Wilson's character is no typical over- macho father figure or anything. Together they provide an unusual boost for horror, which typically strives for random faces with questionable experience.\n\nIn general, "Insidious" possesses a professionalism not often seen in the genre; most horror films go for cheap across the board from the budget to the talent to the thrills. Although "Insidious" lacks distinctiveness in terms of story, not an ounce of it can be perceived as immature or hollow.

Ip Man was the Wing Chun grandmaster and his most famous student was Bruce Lee. This film chronicles the years leading up to his success as a martial arts teacher. It stars Tony Leung Chiu-Wai as Ip Man and Zhang Ziyi as Gong Er, his main love interest. Kar Wai Wong directed and co-wrote the movie (with Jingzhi Zou and Haofeng Xu). Wong is famous for directing and writing other popular Hong Kong period piece dramas like '2046' and 'IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE'. I'd rate this flick about the same as Wong's others; I thought it was extremely beautiful to look at but it's also a tad too hard to follow and uninvolving.\n\nThe story focuses as much on Gong Er (Ziyi) as it does Ip Man and follows a love story between the two as they keep in contact for many years following a fight for Gong's family's honor. Ip Man had defeated her father, Gong Yutian (Wang Qingxiang) in a battle that was as much about philosophical ideas as combat. The film follows Ip Man's years during the Second Sino-Japanese War, in 1938, struggling through poverty with his family. It also focuses on Gong Er's attempt at vengeance against the man who murdered her father, Ma San (Zhang Jin).\n\nThe story is told in a very disjointed way and it was really hard for me to keep up with what was going on in it. I often find these epic Hong Kong Kung Fu flicks to be dull anyway and wasn't too interested in seeing this one. It did get mostly good reviews from critics though and it's nominated for two 2014 Oscars (in Cinematography and Costume Design). It definitely deserves those award nominations and is very breathtaking to look at. I also think Zhang Ziyi is one of the more beautiful and sexy women in cinema today and she gives a great performance here. I'm not sure how I feel about Leung Chiu-Wai as an actor, he's not bad in this movie but I didn't really learn to care for his character much at all. The martial-arts scenes are grand and epic though and I'm sure fans of the genre will be more than pleased.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTUUB4nMD6M","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32739,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-01-08","keywords":"ip man character,falling off a balcony,girl,crying,starving to death","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4109412633","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5NTA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMDc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MTc5NTA1OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzczMDc4OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A story inspired by the life and times of the legendary kung fu master, Ip Man, and set in the tumultuous Republican era that followed the fall of ChinaÂ’s last dynasty, a time of chaos, division and war that was also the golden age of Chinese martial arts."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504897/","name":"Tony Chiu-Wai Leung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1018221/","name":"Jin Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939182/","name":"Kar-Wai Wong"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070147/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074316/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239007/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939182/","name":"Kar-Wai Wong"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1802940/","name":"Jingzhi Zou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4192630/","name":"Haofeng Xu"}],"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Soul Kitchen is Akin' highly anticipated first attempt at a genuine comedy. So far Akin has been has been more involved in the fields of drama and romance. In a recent interview he revealed he was curious to explore a more varied range of film genres which sounds like an interesting plan. In venice this year, the film was celebrated by the audiences and scored the special jury price.\n\nThe story revolves around a restaurant/club called Soul Kitchen and the troublesome life of its respectful owner Zinos. He has to overcome many struggles involving his girlfriend, his brother and the authorities. The film is set in the heart of the diverse northern German city of Hamburg, the home turf of the two scribes Faith Akin and Adam Bousdoukos.\n\nThe makers of the film call it a new take on the idea of the "Heimatfilm" - a rather preconceived loose genre which basically defines a film to have been made in the makers home country and dealing with issues relating to home and identity.\n\nAkin described how he studied classical sketches by Charlie Chaplin and also looked at his method of working. A simple "joke" that comes off easy and natural on screen had been reworked over and over. For some of the scenes Akin admittedly said he had to shoot 30 takes before it felt right. This made him doubt his own abilities but in the end let him grow as a filmmaker and as an individual.\n\nThe result is a stellar solid performance by the entire cast. Many jokes and payoffs will unfortunately and without a doubt get lost in translation but still the timing and heartblood of the actors will still capture anyone's attention.\n\nAkin makes use of a couple of his "regulars": Adam Bousdoukos, Moritz Bleibtreu and the great Birol Ünel but also introduces fresh unknown blood with the two female leads Lucia Faust and Nadine Krüger.\n\nHaving just seen another film recently I noticed myself how well this film is balanced out in comparison. There is a rhythm, a beat or a harmony. The soundtrack and editing allow the plot to flow organically and let the narrative play out smoothly. Interestingly Akin once mentioned that since "Gegen die Wand" (Head On, 2004) he is inspired by the songs used in his films in a visual way and sets out a soundtrack before the filming is finished.\n\nThe film marks Akin's first shot at wider levels of improvisation. Normally, he said in an interview with a German radio station, he has the script all planned out in detail; all the actors know what their dialogues are and maybe one or two things get changed, with feedback from the people on set but this time a lot of things were left undone on purpose to grow naturally out of the situations.\n\nWhat I personally enjoyed a lot about Soul Kitchen is the way in which the film addresses its urban environment. Akin took a chance to shoot in a wide range of locations, many of which such the club "Mojo" have since closed down. It attempts to capture the spirit of the city at a point in time and successfully tells an emotional, personal story.\n\nRecommended to anyone with a passion for fresh, clever and funny stories of life and the city.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37455,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-12-25","keywords":"restaurant,chef,cook,2000s,burglar","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Soul Kitchen","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3270837785","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTM1MjYzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjc0OTUyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTM1MjYzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjc0OTUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Hamburg, German-Greek chef Zinos unknowingly disturbs the peace in his locals-only restaurant by hiring a more talented chef."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100196/","name":"Adam Bousdoukos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001953/","name":"Moritz Bleibtreu"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2114493/","name":"Pheline Roggan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0015359/","name":"Fatih Akin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0123730/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190323/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0015359/","name":"Fatih Akin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100196/","name":"Adam Bousdoukos"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It attempts to capture the spirit of the city at a point in time and successfully tells an emotional, personal story.\n\nRecommended to anyone with a passion for fresh, clever and funny stories of life and the city.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37455,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-12-25","keywords":"restaurant,chef,cook,2000s,burglar","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Soul Kitchen","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3270837785","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTM1MjYzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjc0OTUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTM1MjYzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjc0OTUyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Hamburg, German-Greek chef Zinos unknowingly disturbs the peace in his locals-only restaurant by hiring a more talented chef.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100196/","name":"Adam Bousdoukos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001953/","name":"Moritz Bleibtreu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2114493/","name":"Pheline Roggan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0015359/","name":"Fatih Akin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0123730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190323/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0015359/","name":"Fatih Akin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100196/","name":"Adam Bousdoukos"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I wonder why the sins of the father have to plague the lives of his children.  Why people rape, abuse, hurt, and maim.  In a perfect world everyone would be happy.  In a perfect world no one would ever want.  In a perfect world a women like Aileen Wurnos would not have been sentenced to die on death row, and in a real world I wouldn't have to write about a movie like MONSTER.  It's a movie that drips with exceptional performances, and yet leaves your soul so cold to the core.\n\nMONSTER is the tragic true story of a woman who longed for a friend, and nobody came to her aid.  It stars Charlize Theron (The Devil's Advocate) as Aileen Wurnos, one of the first women to ever die on death row.  Of course the film doesn't begin that way, when we first meet her she's sitting in the rain with a gun contemplating ending it all.  You see she's has no future. She has nothing but a past that's not worth repeating, and all she has in the world is in a storage locker. What little money she has, is gained by being a prostitute.  But one day in a little bar in Daytona Beach, Florida she meets and falls for a woman that finally makes her happy.\n\nThe woman is named Selby (Christina Ricci, The Opposite of Sex), and she's a young lesbian just trying to figure out the world for herself.  At first this relationship puts Aileen on cloud nine.  She's willing to do anything to provide for the first person that ever loved her.\n\nBut one night when Aileen kills a john who gets a little to rough, a series of events take our characters on a one way trip with destiny. Leaving the landscape of these two women's lives are forever changed.  If only someone had just been nice to Aileen.\n\nMONSTER is not a happy film.  It's one of those movies that leaves you dead at the end.  You lose faith in humanity; you lose faith in yourself.  I like these kinds of movies, cause they convict me.  Here I am a young guy who sometimes gets ticked off at a driver in front of me on the road.  For one split moment I have murderous anger when that guy cuts me off.  What if I was in Aileen's situation?  Would I do the same thing?  I would hope not, but hey you never know.\n\nIf there is one performance that will tear you up inside this year, it's Theron's.  For the entire movie you can hardly believe that this is, in real life, a beautiful women.  Theron throws all the glamour out the window, gaining weight and frumping herself up to the point of being ugly.  This is a complete 360 and she's so engrossing.  She carries the film to heights. A lesser actress might turn in a wonderful performance, but Theron was Aileen. This is some brilliant acting.\n\nI also give Kudos to Bruce Dern .  His character has the distinction of being the only person who shows any real compassion for Aileen.  While a small role it sticks out because it's the only real bit of bright light in an otherwise dark and gloomy picture.\n\nThe screenplay by Patty Jenkins (Who also directed) does a great job of giving Aileen and those around her life.  What Aileen did was reprehensible. What she did was evil, and she must pay for that.  But it allows for sympathy. Not all evil is dark and black, and not all people who murder are 100% culpable.  But yet you reap what you sow no matter what you're past.\n\n MONSTER is a well-made, brilliantly acted film that's not for the weak of heart.  It's engaging, engrossing, and realistic.  I think I want to rush out and get the silliest comedy I can find right now, because I need something to offset the dark tone of this film.  While it get a fine recommendation, I just hope that the next time you feel like treating someone like crap, you'll remember just how tragic the life of Aileen Wurnos turned tragic because nobody reached out."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Almost each scene is a visual masterpiece in setting, in colors, in placement of the actors, in the angles of the camera. It's a beauty to watch. But one does not come to the movies as he comes to a museum, and even for a visit in a museum two hours of continuous beauty without a break are tiring. The actors are well chosen, they are fresh faces and yet beautiful (Abbie Cornish) and expressive (Ben Whishaw' John Keats), and the film also brings the most adorable red-haired kid actor I have ever seen (the name is Edie Martin). Characters develop, and people speak, and fall in love, and love falls apart, and life falls apart, and there is a lot of poetry in all this, loudly read poetry, but then one does not come to the movies as he comes to a poetry reading. Some action is needed, some suspense is deserved - and this is exactly what 'Bright Star' is lacking in my opinion.

But in this film neither the dialog nor the story works.\n\n"Hannah and Her Sisters" works so well because Woody Allen understood these characters--how they talk and behave. He knew how to write for them.\n\nThat was 1986. Now it's 2019.\n\n21-year-olds in 2019 don't say "I need a drink, a cigarette and a Berlin ballad." No matter what their background that's not how they would talk.\n\n"A Rainy Day in New York" is filled with references that no one born in the late 1990s would have. Songs by Gershwin, Porter, Berlin. Films from the 1930s and 40s. And the name of the lead character, Gatsby Welles, is just a little too cute. All of these are Woody Allen references. The problem is trying to force these references on these characters. It doesn't work.\n\nMaybe this film is meant to be a fantasy. It's not how 21-year-olds talk and behave in the modern world. It's how Woody Allen wishes they talked and behaved.\n\nNo one wants to see a film about people staring into their phones but the truth is that the two leading characters would have been texting each other every few minutes and wouldn't have gotten so completely separated from each other. I think it's clear that Woody Allen hates cell phones because they get in the way of his stories.\n\nI would have suggested two important changes to the film. Have it take place 25 years earlier--1994 instead of 2019, before everyone had their own phone--and make the characters in their mid-30s instead of their early 20s. With those two changes I think this would be remembered as one of Woody Allen's better films.

My husband tends to reread it occasionally, and I myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind.  We have  videos of many of Redford s movies  and we have watched "A River runs through it" many times.  Redford is part of the "famdamily" as he is always around.   We never get tired of Redford's perception of Norman Maclean writings, and the beauty of Montana. The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. Maclean's father. According to "A River Runs Through It," "Methodists are Baptists who can read,"  a line which by the way is not in the short story,  but I think that is a funny line!  My husband and I are well-read Baptists!\n\nI have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow. I disagree.  As one search for inner peace, this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three/four rhythm of the metronome. The photography is outstanding! The acting is great.  I love the scene where Norman and Paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer! Then as adult Paul played by Brad Pitt (Se7ven)  is the  "perfect guy" who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it. The same applies to Neal Burns, who uses worms as bait, he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help. The scene where Paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace! Finally after hours, they all kneel around the table to say: "Grace!" and they all leave. But the oatmeal stayed on the plate! That scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors!  That is funny! The sunburn! The drive back home where Jessie Burns (Emily Lloyd) decides to go via the train line! Beautiful dialogue when Norman proposes to Jessie because he wants her to come to Chicago with him!\n\nRedford himself does a superb job as a narrator. I could not stop myself from comparing Brad to the young Redford (Barefoot in the Park). The nominated Director, Producer, Actor, is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the US but around the world. I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television, the movies and all the technology and special effects,  to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as Redford because I have had the chance to see his works. Redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of Montana in this masterpiece. The river to me means that line that separates life from death, memories and realities.

In retrospect (as in halfway through the movie), it just clicked, Leonardo was perfect. He wasn't Redford, but in my humble opinion, better! He nailed it, portraying Gatsby as this truly multi-dimensional character. At first, we're introduced to Gatsby, the well-rehearsed old sport telling his canned story about studying at Oxford, Montenegro medals, etc. etc., but then slowly that forced veneer peels away, and he gives us this angsty, desperate, so-happy-in-love, we can remake the past, tortured soul. Much, much better than Redford. And, the same goes with Daisy.

In retrospect (as in halfway through the movie), it just clicked, Leonardo was perfect. He wasn't Redford, but in my humble opinion, better! He nailed it, portraying Gatsby as this truly multi-dimensional character. At first, we're introduced to Gatsby, the well-rehearsed old sport telling his canned story about studying at Oxford, Montenegro medals, etc. etc., but then slowly that forced veneer peels away, and he gives us this angsty, desperate, so-happy-in-love, we can remake the past, tortured soul. Much, much better than Redford. And, the same goes with Daisy. Mia Farrow's Daisy was all flighty and light as a feather, pretty pathetic and self-absorbed, you wonder, what's the big deal with this woman who everyone loves....but with Carey Mulligan, you get it.

[+33%]","reviewBody":"When the directors of 2007's gore-spectacle 'Inside' (Alexandre Bustillo &amp; Julien Maury) took over the reins of a supposed prequel to 1974's Tobe Hooper classic 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre', expectations had indeed sky-rocketed. But what we get isn't even worthy of being called a tribute to the TCM franchise, let alone be regarded as its worthy canon prequel.\n\nThe screenplay offers very little in terms of the surprises it throws at the viewers (and TCM fans), thereby ending up strictly ho-hum. We see a bunch of eccentrics creating a riot at a mental health facility and escaping, with tidbits of the Sawyer family thrown in to engage the viewer. In fact, the makers are trying to sell this movie around the mystery of which character amongst the the leads ultimately evolves into 'Leatherface'. Well, much to our dismay, even this stretch appears annoyingly contrived (and to be honest, the poster kinda spoils it already!). \n\nWhat we're subjected to for most part, is literally a lunatic couple shotgun-killing their way to notoriety on their supposed escape (even the big chainsaw-kill comes in too late) with a helpless nurse named Lizzy (Vanessa Grasse) who has unnecessarily been dragged along with them while also being accompanied by a duo of brothers (the somewhat compassionate Jackson and the bulky Bud). Lizzy is the character we're supposed to root for, but sadly this does not work. We know as little about her as we know about the rest of the zany troupe. \n\nThe directors who're known to stage horrifically-exciting set- pieces, resort to cheap tricks here (like a partial necro scene) in order to augment the shock-value. The shot of a woman's derriere walking into a barn surrounded by badlands (during one of the opening segments, clearly reminding us of previous TCM films including the Michael Bay funded remake) had just about raised my hopes a teeny weeny bit before everything came crashing down. \n\nWith no real thunderbolts in store for fans or non-fans, this prequel falls head first into a pit of quick-sand, the real difference-maker in the story being the weapons (shotguns, knives) that the characters possess and not their personalities. You're bound to forget this movie as soon as the credits roll.\n\nVerdict: Terrible!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20475,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Well, much to our dismay, even this stretch appears annoyingly contrived (and to be honest, the poster kinda spoils it already!). \n\nWhat we're subjected to for most part, is literally a lunatic couple shotgun-killing their way to notoriety on their supposed escape (even the big chainsaw-kill comes in too late) with a helpless nurse named Lizzy (Vanessa Grasse) who has unnecessarily been dragged along with them while also being accompanied by a duo of brothers (the somewhat compassionate Jackson and the bulky Bud). Lizzy is the character we're supposed to root for, but sadly this does not work. We know as little about her as we know about the rest of the zany troupe. \n\nThe directors who're known to stage horrifically-exciting set- pieces, resort to cheap tricks here (like a partial necro scene) in order to augment the shock-value. The shot of a woman's derriere walking into a barn surrounded by badlands (during one of the opening segments, clearly reminding us of previous TCM films including the Michael Bay funded remake) had just about raised my hopes a teeny weeny bit before everything came crashing down. \n\nWith no real thunderbolts in store for fans or non-fans, this prequel falls head first into a pit of quick-sand, the real difference-maker in the story being the weapons (shotguns, knives) that the characters possess and not their personalities. You're bound to forget this movie as soon as the credits roll.\n\nVerdict: Terrible!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20475,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Seven years later, he finally returns, and with The Descendants, he returns with a bang.\n\nLike Sideways, his screenplay (co-written by Nat Faxon and Jim Rash) nails the tone right on the head. It has to balance out three tricky narratives in the film (Matt King's self-crisis, his comatose wife's affair with another man before her boating accident, and a land deal he's reported to make), and without the proper guidance it needed, along with Payne's own confidant direction, it could have faltered. Thankfully, it balances out heavy themes and complicated emotions in uncommon detail.\n\nThe characters in this movie are many, complicated, and sorrowful in their own unique ways. Matt King was a perfect role for George Clooney. He keeps his composure, but we can still see a very heavy, filtered sorrow beneath the surface. Shailene Woodley's character (Woodley, by the way, gives one of the year's best performances) begins with a rebellious, even angry sadness, but we can see her develop over the course of the film, gaining a strong maturity beyond her years. Judy Greer and Robert Forster are each given a few spare scenes, and they make every second of their screen time count.\n\nIt really is an emotional ride, even depressing sometimes, but I'm surprised by the occasional review I read where critics say they didn't feel the emotion to be sincere. In my opinion, the emotions of the film never hit a single false note. I don't think just anybody could have made this movie the way it is.

The first time I watched this movie, I felt a strange sense of depression that lasted for a few days, but I couldn't put my finger on why. I watched it again and again, and felt the same way each time. I thought maybe it was because I have never traveled and would really like to, or that I have the desire to find the perfect woman in a strange world.\n\nWhatever the case, I realized one thing. LOST IN TRANSLATION MADE ME THINK. It made me question my life, its purpose, whether I was happy or not, and what I want do with it. Never has a movie touched me in such a way, and for that reason, this is the one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.

The first time I watched this movie, I felt a strange sense of depression that lasted for a few days, but I couldn't put my finger on why. I watched it again and again, and felt the same way each time. I thought maybe it was because I have never traveled and would really like to, or that I have the desire to find the perfect woman in a strange world.\n\nWhatever the case, I realized one thing. LOST IN TRANSLATION MADE ME THINK. It made me question my life, its purpose, whether I was happy or not, and what I want do with it. Never has a movie touched me in such a way, and for that reason, this is the one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.

Another Improbable Hero Kid movie?\n\nThe fine point of it is: No.  If you run screamin' at the mention of Home Alone or Goonies, you needn't be afraid of a movie like this.\n\nThe kids impart a genuine, unself-conscious mood to everything in the film, contributing in large part to its subtle and pervasive good humor.  I marvelled at the creativity of the Ballydowse kids, and was at the same time satisfied that their rivals were never reduced to mindless obstacles to rouse our sympathy.\n\nAs we can see the war from the kids' view, we can see its reflection in their parents, and of course, in adults everywhere.  But the film keeps its subtlety here too; we're never beaten over the head with the analogy, but given the right views to delight in it - their creativity and intelligence belongs to all ages.\n\nMy one reservation is the soundtrack; it's manipulative and lacks the subtlety of the rest of it.\n\nThree favorite scenes: Little Con breaking his eggs and marooned for a bit with the Carrick boys, the teacher translating Riley's passed note, and the carousal and tractor.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4197,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"1994-10-14","keywords":"male nudity,slingshot,garment button,foreign language adaptation,remake of french film","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0280249/","name":"Gregg Fitzgerald"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1918199/","name":"Gerard Kearney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622543/","name":"Darragh Naughton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0731253/","name":"John Roberts"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103613/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066753/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0016450/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0673681/","name":"Louis Pergaud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919815/","name":"Colin Welland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002216/","name":"Yves Robert"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Another Improbable Hero Kid movie?\n\nThe fine point of it is: No.  If you run screamin' at the mention of Home Alone or Goonies, you needn't be afraid of a movie like this.\n\nThe kids impart a genuine, unself-conscious mood to everything in the film, contributing in large part to its subtle and pervasive good humor.  I marvelled at the creativity of the Ballydowse kids, and was at the same time satisfied that their rivals were never reduced to mindless obstacles to rouse our sympathy.\n\nAs we can see the war from the kids' view, we can see its reflection in their parents, and of course, in adults everywhere.  But the film keeps its subtlety here too; we're never beaten over the head with the analogy, but given the right views to delight in it - their creativity and intelligence belongs to all ages.\n\nMy one reservation is the soundtrack; it's manipulative and lacks the subtlety of the rest of it.\n\nThree favorite scenes: Little Con breaking his eggs and marooned for a bit with the Carrick boys, the teacher translating Riley's passed note, and the carousal and tractor.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4197,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"1994-10-14","keywords":"male nudity,slingshot,garment button,foreign language adaptation,remake of french film","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0280249/","name":"Gregg Fitzgerald","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1918199/","name":"Gerard Kearney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622543/","name":"Darragh Naughton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0731253/","name":"John Roberts"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103613/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066753/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0016450/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0673681/","name":"Louis Pergaud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919815/","name":"Colin Welland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002216/","name":"Yves Robert"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Another Improbable Hero Kid movie?\n\nThe fine point of it is: No.  If you run screamin' at the mention of Home Alone or Goonies, you needn't be afraid of a movie like this.\n\nThe kids impart a genuine, unself-conscious mood to everything in the film, contributing in large part to its subtle and pervasive good humor.  I marvelled at the creativity of the Ballydowse kids, and was at the same time satisfied that their rivals were never reduced to mindless obstacles to rouse our sympathy.\n\nAs we can see the war from the kids' view, we can see its reflection in their parents, and of course, in adults everywhere.  But the film keeps its subtlety here too; we're never beaten over the head with the analogy, but given the right views to delight in it - their creativity and intelligence belongs to all ages.\n\nMy one reservation is the soundtrack; it's manipulative and lacks the subtlety of the rest of it.\n\nThree favorite scenes: Little Con breaking his eggs and marooned for a bit with the Carrick boys, the teacher translating Riley's passed note, and the carousal and tractor.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4197,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"1994-10-14","keywords":"male nudity,slingshot,garment button,foreign language adaptation,remake of french film","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0280249/","name":"Gregg Fitzgerald"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1918199/","name":"Gerard Kearney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622543/","name":"Darragh Naughton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0731253/","name":"John Roberts"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103613/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066753/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0016450/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0673681/","name":"Louis Pergaud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919815/","name":"Colin Welland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002216/","name":"Yves Robert"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Another Improbable Hero Kid movie?\n\nThe fine point of it is: No.  If you run screamin' at the mention of Home Alone or Goonies, you needn't be afraid of a movie like this.\n\nThe kids impart a genuine, unself-conscious mood to everything in the film, contributing in large part to its subtle and pervasive good humor.  I marvelled at the creativity of the Ballydowse kids, and was at the same time satisfied that their rivals were never reduced to mindless obstacles to rouse our sympathy.\n\nAs we can see the war from the kids' view, we can see its reflection in their parents, and of course, in adults everywhere.  But the film keeps its subtlety here too; we're never beaten over the head with the analogy, but given the right views to delight in it - their creativity and intelligence belongs to all ages.\n\nMy one reservation is the soundtrack; it's manipulative and lacks the subtlety of the rest of it.\n\nThree favorite scenes: Little Con breaking his eggs and marooned for a bit with the Carrick boys, the teacher translating Riley's passed note, and the carousal and tractor.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4197,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"1994-10-14","keywords":"male nudity,slingshot,garment button,foreign language adaptation,remake of french film","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0280249/","name":"Gregg Fitzgerald","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1918199/","name":"Gerard Kearney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0622543/","name":"Darragh Naughton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0731253/","name":"John Roberts"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103613/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066753/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0016450/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0673681/","name":"Louis Pergaud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0919815/","name":"Colin Welland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002216/","name":"Yves Robert"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And it's Okay.","reviewBody":"French humor cinema doesn't dare stupidity. Usually. Eric and Ramzy did a stupid movie, "la tour montparnasse infernale" and it worked quite well. La Beuze is of that kind : the two heroes are stupid, they do stupid things and they meet stupide people. And that's okay for me, it doesn't pretend to be much more ! There is even a very very light kind of emotion, yeap, something happens, I don't know what. Maybe it comes from the score, lots of 70's-80's music... Maybe it is because it's a blaxplotation movie ?

La Beuze is of that kind : the two heroes are stupid, they do stupid things and they meet stupide people. And that's okay for me, it doesn't pretend to be much more ! There is even a very very light kind of emotion, yeap, something happens, I don't know what. Maybe it comes from the score, lots of 70's-80's music... Maybe it is because it's a blaxplotation movie ?

A great start for Sony Pictures Animation!","reviewBody":"What's a 'unihorn' you may ask? Well, it's a deer that only has one antler, of course. And you'll only see one in the new Sony Pictures Animation film, Open Season, starring Martin Lawrence, Debra Messing, Ashton Kutcher, Gary Sinise, Jon Favreau, and many more.\n\nMartin voices the lovable Boog in the film; he's the main attraction of a show at the zoo with his best friend, Beth (Debra Messing). Boog also lives with Beth, equipped with his stuffed animal, Dunkleman. On a completely side note, what would a Sony film be without a reference to one of their own. Before Boog settles in for his comfy night sleep, he checks out Pat Sajak on Wheel of Fortune.\n\nThey have a great life together doing shows for the fans, even exchanging powerful roars. But that's before Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) shows up, the hapless one-antlered deer who's been captured by the evil Shaw (Gary Sinise). Boog helps Elliot escape and makes Boog's and Beth's life miserable, forcing Beth to send the two animals away into the forest.\n\nOn his own for the first time, Boog now has to rely on himself, or be stuck with Elliot. And that means figuring out how to go to the bathroom in the wild. That's when he first runs into McSquizzy, the squirrel (voiced by Billy Connolly)  McSquizzy is the ruler of the forest trees, and has a great and powerful squirrel Army to back him up, equipped with thousand of acorns. Without a doubt, McSquizzy is one of the highlights of Open Season! He's got wit, humor, and a ton of Scottish charm.\n\nBoog realizes having Elliot around is the only way he'll get back to Beth. So they become 'partners,' much to the dismay of Boog  but the delight of Elliot, who just needs a friend. With hunting season right around the corner, the two must work together to sneak around the hunters.\n\nBut when Shaw breaks the hunting season date, the animals switch their thinking  instead of running away, they're going to fight back! And fight back they do! Trying to run away, Boog crosses a dam; unfortunately, his 900 pound body crumbles the wood.\n\nThat's when Open Season turns into Hill Street Blues! There is one of the most amazing chase scenes I've ever seen in the movies. Boog, Elliot, and their porcupine friend try and escape the gun shots of Shaw  but on water. Bobbing and weaving through the water, under water, above water, around rocks  great scene! There's even a waterfall at the end to top it off! I have somewhat of a test for animated movies I've been giving myself over the past few years  ever since seeing the water scenes in The Incredibles, and noticing how real it looked, I've started to take an eye to the screen. If water doesn't look real, than it doesn't pass the test. Let's just say, Open Season aced my test. This water chase scene goes on for about 5 minutes, maybe a little more; but it's so exciting and amazing to watch! It's not just the water of Open Season, it's the entire field of animation; the animals really come alive on the screen. I'm a huge fan of animation; I think it has to do with the fact that anything done with computer fascinates me. The detailed description of each character, from their eyes, nose, mouth, walk, and hair  and in this movie, fur; it's just so amazing! But back to the story - after meeting back up with the group of beavers, led by Reilly (voiced by Jon Favreau), some of Elliot's former deer mates (Patrick Warburton and Jane Krakowski), and a few other animals, Boog and Elliot team up and go on the attack against the hunters. Bras, plungers, grills, forks, knives, spoons, and basically, anything they can get their hands on  sorry, whatever they can get their paws on  they use to charge the hunters with.\n\nOpen Season is directed by Jill Culton, Roger Allers, and Tony Stacchi; each has a number of major credits to their name. Both Tony and Jill make their feature directorial debut on this film; however, Jill has worked at Pixar on the character development for Monsters Inc. and Toy Story. Tony worked on a number of films for ILM including Hook and Ghost. Roger Allers co-directed The Lion King, and has just recently completed The Little Match Girl  a short attached to The Little Mermaid.\n\nOpen Season is a fun and very enjoyable film for kids and families. It's definitely a film you'll be talking about for a long time. And don't forget, you can also check out the film in IMAX 3D, opening at major theaters across the country.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89010,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In 2D, I only give it a very lukewarm recommendation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153017,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2009-04-01","keywords":"giant,alien,giantess,alien invasion,enlargement","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Monsters vs. Aliens -- Superbowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2117665561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwMzY5OTc5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQzNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQwMzY5OTc5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQzNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the Monsters vs. Aliens commercial which aired during the 2009 Superbowl.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000702/","name":"Reese Witherspoon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933988/","name":"Rainn Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170306/","name":"Stephen Colbert"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1224299/","name":"Rob Letterman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0970447/","name":"Conrad Vernon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285379/","name":"Maya Forbes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0938645/","name":"Wallace Wolodarsky","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1224299/","name":"Rob Letterman"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's so ambient, it would work just as well as a radio play. En route to collecting their kids from summer camp, 'married alive' couple Antoine (Pierre-Darroussin) and Helene (Bouquet) bicker in the car, as Antoine accuses her of cramping his style. The only way this sad little man can assert himself is to pull over and slug whisky after whisky in every roadside bar. When his furious wife bails out to catch the train instead, it's the start of one of those Long Dark Nights of the Soul for both parties.

En route to collecting their kids from summer camp, 'married alive' couple Antoine (Pierre-Darroussin) and Helene (Bouquet) bicker in the car, as Antoine accuses her of cramping his style. The only way this sad little man can assert himself is to pull over and slug whisky after whisky in every roadside bar.

In my opinion, it represents the best kind of literary adaptation that the cinema offers: One in which the screenwriter and director clearly remained faithful to the spirit of the book without attempting to reproduce it.  How can you go wrong with a Margaret Atwood book, a Harold Pinter screenplay and Volker Schlöndorff's direction?  Some have suggested that the film suffered from "wooden" acting.  Personally, I thought it was a fantastic cast: Robert Duvall and Victoria Tennant at their evil best; Faye Dunnaway as the "defeated" wife; Elizabeth McGovern as saucy as ever; Aidan Quinn and Natascha Richardson in the necessarily bland roles that drive the narrative. What holes here?\n\nCommercial film doesn't get any better.  "The Handmaid's Tale" is a dark portrait of a world unlike ours and yet so much like ours... in which a right-wing, bureaucratic patriarchy dominates the land.  Women have three main functions (for which their clothing is color coded): Red for the handmaids, who are walking wombs; white for the innnocent children; blue for the sterile trophy wives.  Brown is worn by the "aunts", a futuristic equivalent of the Sonderkomando (i.e., Jews who worked on behalf of the Nazi's in the death camps), evil schoolmistress types who both train/brainwash young women for assignment and occasionally destroy them. A fifth function, for which the garb is particularly interesting, is "working" in Gilead's underground social club (essentially a den of iniquity, rife with prostitution and drugs.)  Point is... by splitting up these functions, hasn't Atwood described the basic roles that women play within our own male-dominated society, in various different permutations and combinations? To the patriarchy, women are mothers, models, sluts, angels and, when professionals, they are not to aspire to more teaching posts.  In Gilead, the lines are clearer; in our own society, aren't most women "supposed to" play some combination of all of these roles?\n\nI get the feeling that most moviegoers are looking for something else in "sci-fi."  Here's a new plot twist: The rebels feed Kate some kind of medication that allows her to read the commander's mind while destroying his brain.  Wait... that's "Scanners."  Oops.  Seriously, two of the reviews on this site made spedific mention of Schlöndorff's "horrible", "atrocious" directorial skills.  Ahem.  Perhaps before they weigh in on the auteur, they ought to see "Young Törless", "Coup de grâce", "The Tin Drum" and all of his other wonderful efforts.  As a matter of fact, to insinuate that someone who could bring Grass' Tin Drum to the screen in such a stunning fashion is a lousy director is PREPOSTEROUS.  Schlöndorff is a giant of the New German Cinema, and it underscores the ignorance of the Hollywooders when they cast such baseless aspersions.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9319,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1990-02-15","keywords":"fundamentalist religion,dystopia,pantyhose,impregnation,totalitarian state","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Handmaid's Tale","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1673183001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBiMWJjNmUtMDY4MS00ZDEyLWI4NzItOWQwNTJkMmUzYmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBiMWJjNmUtMDY4MS00ZDEyLWI4NzItOWQwNTJkMmUzYmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001670/","name":"Natasha Richardson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001159/","name":"Faye Dunaway"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001644/","name":"Aidan Quinn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0772522/","name":"Volker Schlöndorff"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023183/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046677/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021184/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041194/","name":"Margaret Atwood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0056217/","name":"Harold Pinter"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"The Handmaid's Tale" is a dark portrait of a world unlike ours and yet so much like ours... in which a right-wing, bureaucratic patriarchy dominates the land.  Women have three main functions (for which their clothing is color coded): Red for the handmaids, who are walking wombs; white for the innnocent children; blue for the sterile trophy wives.  Brown is worn by the "aunts", a futuristic equivalent of the Sonderkomando (i.e., Jews who worked on behalf of the Nazi's in the death camps), evil schoolmistress types who both train/brainwash young women for assignment and occasionally destroy them. A fifth function, for which the garb is particularly interesting, is "working" in Gilead's underground social club (essentially a den of iniquity, rife with prostitution and drugs.)  Point is... by splitting up these functions, hasn't Atwood described the basic roles that women play within our own male-dominated society, in various different permutations and combinations? To the patriarchy, women are mothers, models, sluts, angels and, when professionals, they are not to aspire to more teaching posts.  In Gilead, the lines are clearer; in our own society, aren't most women "supposed to" play some combination of all of these roles?\n\nI get the feeling that most moviegoers are looking for something else in "sci-fi."  Here's a new plot twist: The rebels feed Kate some kind of medication that allows her to read the commander's mind while destroying his brain.  Wait... that's "Scanners."  Oops.  Seriously, two of the reviews on this site made spedific mention of Schlöndorff's "horrible", "atrocious" directorial skills.  Ahem.  Perhaps before they weigh in on the auteur, they ought to see "Young Törless", "Coup de grâce", "The Tin Drum" and all of his other wonderful efforts.  As a matter of fact, to insinuate that someone who could bring Grass' Tin Drum to the screen in such a stunning fashion is a lousy director is PREPOSTEROUS.  Schlöndorff is a giant of the New German Cinema, and it underscores the ignorance of the Hollywooders when they cast such baseless aspersions.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9319,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1990-02-15","keywords":"fundamentalist religion,dystopia,pantyhose,impregnation,totalitarian state","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Handmaid's Tale","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1673183001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBiMWJjNmUtMDY4MS00ZDEyLWI4NzItOWQwNTJkMmUzYmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBiMWJjNmUtMDY4MS00ZDEyLWI4NzItOWQwNTJkMmUzYmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001670/","name":"Natasha Richardson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001159/","name":"Faye Dunaway","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001644/","name":"Aidan Quinn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0772522/","name":"Volker Schlöndorff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023183/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046677/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021184/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041194/","name":"Margaret Atwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0056217/","name":"Harold Pinter"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!\n\nDirector, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson &amp; Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth! \n\nIn the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of "Super-Star". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do so What a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!) \n\nOn the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already aware audiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .\n\nFor my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .\n\nTo highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .\n\nBefore rushing out to see it, just a little warning.

The French are still living today with the guilt of all that and this film is one of the rare examples of a frank look at this from the inside.

The villains are not the Germans but the French people themselves. The real horror is not in the big scenes of torture but the ordinariness of the concierge cheerfully denouncing people in her own building. The French are still living today with the guilt of all that and this film is one of the rare examples of a frank look at this from the inside. I called it a "worthy" film which carries the film-makers problem of telling a tough story but still needing to seduce an audience into the cinema. The Picture House had a very small audience when I saw it tonight.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3168,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2009-09-16","keywords":"female full frontal nudity,female frontal nudity,circumcision,world war two,underground resistance","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Army of Crime","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1601634841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTY1OTQyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTY1OTQyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Paris 1941.

One of my favourite songs was "In my Room" by Brian Wilson. Chasing Mavericks deals with people coming to terms with massive gaps in their lives but somehow focusing on something bigger than themselves to pull through. If you love surfing or the ocean, this movie is for you. Mavericks was brought to world wide attention with Stacey Peralta's film "Riding Giants". Jay has lost his father early in life, and has to act as a pseudo parent for his mother who suffers from the breakup. He accidentally discovers that his much older neighbour Frosty is a big wave surfer and so a teacher mentor relationship starts. Frosty, as well, has terrible father issues which continue to plague him. Their relationship develops momentum and gives each of them energy and purpose. The film underlines the choices we can make in life. Everyone has scars and issues to deal with. Do we give up and spiral downwards or do we set big goals (waves) and go after them. Jay plans carefully in his room to conquer his fears and reach his goal. Excellent and heartfelt acting.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31379,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One of my favourite songs was "In my Room" by Brian Wilson. Chasing Mavericks deals with people coming to terms with massive gaps in their lives but somehow focusing on something bigger than themselves to pull through. If you love surfing or the ocean, this movie is for you. Mavericks was brought to world wide attention with Stacey Peralta's film "Riding Giants". Jay has lost his father early in life, and has to act as a pseudo parent for his mother who suffers from the breakup. He accidentally discovers that his much older neighbour Frosty is a big wave surfer and so a teacher mentor relationship starts. Frosty, as well, has terrible father issues which continue to plague him. Their relationship develops momentum and gives each of them energy and purpose. The film underlines the choices we can make in life. Everyone has scars and issues to deal with. Do we give up and spiral downwards or do we set big goals (waves) and go after them. Jay plans carefully in his room to conquer his fears and reach his goal. Excellent and heartfelt acting.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31379,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Vincent, a 20-year old geology student from Paris, goes to French Guyana to do an internship at a gold mining company.

From the title, I was sure I'd see a portmanteau movie of unconnected short stories, similar to 1983's "Twilight Zone: The Movie". But with a kid-centric plot and set in a small American town, the formula is similar to "It" or "Super 8". However, the episodic nature of serial "incidents" aligns it more with the style of the "Final Destination" films.\n\nStella Nicholls (Zoe Margaret Colletti) is a horror geek and aspiring writer living in Mill Valley, a small Pennsylvanian town during the Nixon election of 1968. Stella has a couple of friends: the requisite Scoobie Doo Shaggy character Chuck (Austin Zajur) and the 'sensible' "it's all science" character Auggie (Gabriel Rush). But pursued by local hoodlum Tommy (Austin Abrams), Stella, Chuck and Auggie are thrown together with draft-dodging outsider Ramón (Michael Garza).\n\nThey escape into the local spooky house - a house where legend has it that terrible things were done to a strange albini girl, Sarah. That legend has it that Sarah used to tell local kids scary stories through the walls. And Stella finds a book... a book that appears to be unfinished....\n\nThis is a time when horror films are either "old school" or more psychological in nature (like "Hereditary"). This one has Guillermo del Toro's hand behind that of lead-writers Dan and Kevin Hagerman. And it's firmly old-school. There are some effective (but at times comically created) spooky moments that are scary without being hugely gory. This earns it a UK15, rather than a UK18, certificate. It's disappointing that doesn't stretch to 12A to attract a younger teenage audience, since the source material is actually from a "Goosebumps"-like set of short stories by Alvin Schwartz.\n\nThe story's 'episodes' are nicely varied. At the gross-out end of the scale is an episode with Chuck's sister Ruth (Natalie Ganzhorn) that might get arachnophobes running for the exits. My personal favourite? A 'red room' episode with the oncoming fate comically arriving in slow-motion like the steam-roller in "Austin Powers"!\n\nThis is another film that relies on the quality of its young cast, with the only moderately well-know cast name being Gil Bellows as the local sheriff. In this regard, the stand-out performance is that of Zoe Margaret Colletti who does a fabulous job as Stella. She's been in a few films in the past ("Annie", "Wildlife" and "Skin") but this is her breakout performance in a starring role. She's done her CV a great favour here.\n\nDirected by "Troll Hunter" director André Øvredal, I really enjoyed this one. I'm not a massive fan of 'slasher' style horror films. I have no burning desire to be constantly reminded of what the inside of my body looks like. So this turned out to be much-more to my liking than the normal horror flick. It had enough spookiness to make me turn on the lights when I got back home, but not enough to pervade my dreams.\n\nThe young cast perform well. They are given enough back-story and personality by the script to make you care about their fate.\n\nSo overall, this one comes with a "Recommended for wimps" (like me)!\n\n(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook.

Add to the mix the danger of bringing a much-loved novel to life on screen, and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—based on John le Carré's book—throws an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up, making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key characters—most of whom go by at least two names—the film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed, particularly considering its reserved pace; the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression, constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film, the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache; indeed, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed therein—the brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shot—an extreme close-up of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow— affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids, giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of, and familiarity with, this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast; a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display: a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt, Hardy to Cumberbatch, Oldman to Dencik, the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together, each actor inhabiting their character with award-courting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisation—an all-too often underutilised aspect in this genre—each of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage, but ours is with them: exploring their motivations; their private lives; their loyalties; and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities, but rather human beings with emotions, afflicted by the agonies of their toils, burying themselves in vodka-laced punch to just get away from it all.\n\nHitting all the right notes in its performances, script, and direction, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity, questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives. Shot with unforgettable effulgence—committing to memory eternal every last contour of Oldman's storied brow—it is a genuine achievement in cinematic storytelling.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. \n\nTaking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.\n\nA film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.   \n\nUnlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, `Ocean's Eleven' is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.  It's cinematic junk food of the highest order, but, then, since when has junk food not been satisfying?"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":528712,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. \n\nTaking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.\n\nA film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.   \n\nUnlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, `Ocean's Eleven' is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.

The cast includes George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, and Matt Damon from the A-list, as well as such established veterans as Andy Garcia, Elliot Gould and Carl Reiner in there playing along with them.  Coming right off the heels of two highly acclaimed, award-laden serious dramas (`Traffic' and `Erin Brockovich'), it's understandable that Soderbergh might have been in the mood for something a little lighter in tone right about now.  Well, he has certainly found it with this property, which sails along smoothly like a well-oiled machine, with no angst-filled messages or heavy-handed themes to gum up the works. \n\nTaking the basic premise from the original 1960 film (which featured a who's-who of Hollywood stars of its own day), Soderbergh has updated it to reflect the advanced technological realities of the 21st Century.   In this film, recently paroled Daniel Ocean (Clooney) has decided to mastermind the robbing of not one but three major Las Vegas casinos all owned by the nefarious Terry Benedict (Garcia).  The rub is that Benedict has also recently added Ocean's ex-wife, Tess (Roberts), to his list of assets, which gives Ocean additional incentive to take Benedict for everything he's got. One of the amazing things is that the filmmakers use an actual casino as their target (the Bellagio) rather than devising a fictional one for their story's purpose.  One might think it could give certain audience members the wrong ideas.  Be that as it may, the director does a fine job exploiting the Vegas setting, taking us right into the heart of casino operations.\n\nA film like `Ocean's Eleven' stands or falls on the charisma of its stars, the intricacy of its plotting and the plausibility of its actions.  Luckily for the audience, the film pretty much succeeds on all three counts. Scenarist Ted Griffin does a fine job gathering together the men who will participate in the heist, allowing each a moment or two to define his character and to become part of the team.  The details of the plan itself are explained in very clear terms so that we rarely feel as if we are not able to follow the action.   There is even an inspired use of `Clair de Lune' near the end of the picture to lend an air of romanticism to the accomplishment, for who would deny that such large-scale thievery has often carried with it a certain element of idealism and romance?  After all, look how many books and films have featured robbers as heroes.  It perhaps explains why Tess can go from being a principled, law-abiding citizen at the beginning of the film to being an accomplice in crime at the end, all for the love of a man  and we cheer her for it.   \n\nUnlike in Soderbergh's other films, we do not find hidden depths lurking beneath the shining handsome surface of this movie, and we certainly carry no nutritious food for thought away with us from this film as we did from the others.  In fact, `Ocean's Eleven' is all ABOUT shining handsome surface and it makes no pretension of being about anything else.  It's cinematic junk food of the highest order, but, then, since when has junk food not been satisfying?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":528712,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Laziness to come up with such a flimsy script on such a challenging subject matter, and laziness to cast the bland Gilles Lellouche as the hyper-realistic financial shark that should have been too fascinating for our own good.\n\nIf it's not laziness, that means Klapisch has risen to his level of incompetence and will only be able to dish out the same youthful light comedies again and again.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2011-03-16","keywords":"single mother,predatory capitalism,capitalism,jobless,resisting arrest","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3307052569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTY4MDQ2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY0NzcwNw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTY4MDQ2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY0NzcwNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After losing her job at a local factory, a single mother enrolls in a housekeeper training program, soon landing work cleaning the Paris apartment of handsome but cocky power broker.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0895759/","name":"Karin Viard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0500976/","name":"Gilles Lellouche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2188804/","name":"Audrey Lamy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458251/","name":"Cédric Klapisch"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458251/","name":"Cédric Klapisch"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However, films about politicians and those around them seem to be more successful than the politicians themselves. A good example in this regard is 'Alice et le maire' ('Alice and the Mayor') a film that comes from France, a country that seems to be in recent years in a permanent state of dissatisfaction with the existing economic and social order, with its political institutions and with members of the political class. The film, whose action takes place a few years ago at the City Hall of Lyon and in the milieu of the municipal and political bureaucracy of the Socialist Party, enjoyed an unexpected success without even resorting to sensationalist issues such as crime, sex, or corruption scandals. Perhaps precisely through the relaxed and slightly humorous approach, the script written by Nicolas Pariser (who is also the director of the film) reaches more effectively aspects of deeper, systemic corruption of the French political machinery.\n\nHowever, the premises of the story do not seem too credible. I am not very familiar with the French political system, but I believe that even in France there are no positions for philosophers advisers to the mayors, paid on public money, nor that politicians with decades of political activity and presidential ambitions publicly declare that they are short of ideas. Probably, then, only in the films Alice (Anaïs Demoustier), a fresh graduate from Oxford, could she employed at the City Hall in Lyon just to provide ideas to Mayor Paul Theraneau (Fabrice Luchini) and that could become in a few days or weeks involved at top level in the affairs of the city and of the Socialist Party. The activity of the party on the public money of the town hall also seems little plausible. Probably the whole situation should be viewed more as a cinematic convention rather than real events in the immediate actuality. But even so, the dialogues between the mayor and the young philosopher represent the guiding thread and the most successful and probably the most important part of the movie from the point of view of the filmmakers.\n\nThe discussions between the two protagonists work very well thanks to the charm and the talent of the two actors. The mayor's role is written for Fabrice Luchini who lends to the character his noble style, intellectual charisma and impeccable French language, serving us even with a reading from a book, one of those that made him famous in France. Anaïs Demoustier copes well with the scenes that she shares with Luchini, but also with those that describe her personal dilemmas and the confrontation with the municipal bureaucracy. Secondary roles create believable portrait sketches of Alice's friends and of the politicians and bureaucrats in the town hall hierarchy. The story, however, stumbles badly towards the end, when the politician's decision or indecision at critical moments is difficult to understand, perhaps due to the use of details related to party politics. French viewers might be better off deciphering such details as well as some of the literary and cultural references appearing in discussions, but cinematically the story does not hold water. The approach of 'Alice and the Mayor' is comical and empathetic towards the heroes, the ending is open, so what we get is pleasant entertainment around a political topic. Of course, there will be other films that will address the troubled French political actuality with different approaches and from many other points of view.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"lyon france,mayor,politics,female protagonist,year 2017","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2747252249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1326732/","name":"Anaïs Demoustier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3937233/","name":"Nora Hamzawi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093091/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625796/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Probably, then, only in the films Alice (Anaïs Demoustier), a fresh graduate from Oxford, could she employed at the City Hall in Lyon just to provide ideas to Mayor Paul Theraneau (Fabrice Luchini) and that could become in a few days or weeks involved at top level in the affairs of the city and of the Socialist Party. The activity of the party on the public money of the town hall also seems little plausible. Probably the whole situation should be viewed more as a cinematic convention rather than real events in the immediate actuality. But even so, the dialogues between the mayor and the young philosopher represent the guiding thread and the most successful and probably the most important part of the movie from the point of view of the filmmakers.\n\nThe discussions between the two protagonists work very well thanks to the charm and the talent of the two actors. The mayor's role is written for Fabrice Luchini who lends to the character his noble style, intellectual charisma and impeccable French language, serving us even with a reading from a book, one of those that made him famous in France. Anaïs Demoustier copes well with the scenes that she shares with Luchini, but also with those that describe her personal dilemmas and the confrontation with the municipal bureaucracy. Secondary roles create believable portrait sketches of Alice's friends and of the politicians and bureaucrats in the town hall hierarchy. The story, however, stumbles badly towards the end, when the politician's decision or indecision at critical moments is difficult to understand, perhaps due to the use of details related to party politics. French viewers might be better off deciphering such details as well as some of the literary and cultural references appearing in discussions, but cinematically the story does not hold water. The approach of 'Alice and the Mayor' is comical and empathetic towards the heroes, the ending is open, so what we get is pleasant entertainment around a political topic. Of course, there will be other films that will address the troubled French political actuality with different approaches and from many other points of view.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"lyon france,mayor,politics,female protagonist,year 2017","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2747252249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1326732/","name":"Anaïs Demoustier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3937233/","name":"Nora Hamzawi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093091/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625796/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has to balance out three tricky narratives in the film (Matt King's self-crisis, his comatose wife's affair with another man before her boating accident, and a land deal he's reported to make), and without the proper guidance it needed, along with Payne's own confidant direction, it could have faltered. Thankfully, it balances out heavy themes and complicated emotions in uncommon detail.\n\nThe characters in this movie are many, complicated, and sorrowful in their own unique ways. Matt King was a perfect role for George Clooney. He keeps his composure, but we can still see a very heavy, filtered sorrow beneath the surface. Shailene Woodley's character (Woodley, by the way, gives one of the year's best performances) begins with a rebellious, even angry sadness, but we can see her develop over the course of the film, gaining a strong maturity beyond her years. Judy Greer and Robert Forster are each given a few spare scenes, and they make every second of their screen time count.\n\nIt really is an emotional ride, even depressing sometimes, but I'm surprised by the occasional review I read where critics say they didn't feel the emotion to be sincere. In my opinion, the emotions of the film never hit a single false note. I don't think just anybody could have made this movie the way it is.

The plot is absurd (staying in your city in August, okay... Moving to another apartment just for the summer?), the situations are forced, the dialogues are unreal, the performances are poor, the tempo is inadequate (the film is way too slow)... The conversations are silly (they sound like teenagers going through their adolescent crisis more than grown 33 years old people discussing about real problems).

The result is messy and at times superficial.\n\nIn this blend of images and emotions actors aren't use to deliver an acting performance but more so to make the philosophical questioning move along. The problem is the questioning stagnates and closure never really gets through. Even if we understand that the border between Life and Death is as thin as a bank of sand between two seas on which we may meet sometimes, the audience is left with the same Belief before entering the Theater. Eventually you remain the same before and after the movie. You don't feel any more comfort, tranquility, clarity or even sadness. You've just seen beautiful shots.\n\nSoaked with Christian Philosophy Tree of Life delivers as a very well shot film but never provides the audience with a sense of progression and closure. The story of this Family never really takes off nor does the Philosophic Questioning gets to an end.\n\nAt posteriori Tree of Life seems like an audacious idea on paper and lays out good material to explore.

As I wrote above ,the affair between a handsome priest and a lovely nun is only a detail in a dense screenplay :it's really love at first sight , the nun lets her hair down and presto ,they act .One must note that the marriage for catholic priests (the protestant ministers do ,I personally attended a baptism held but a female minister )is hardly brought up ,which is amazing all the same (although pope François is modern,there are many conservatives among the cardinals ,one hears ....)\n\n In direct contrast with this bourgeois religious people , we have Frederico ,the black priest:he's the only one who does what the Gospels told us a long time ago; he denounces the sad fate of Brazilian's peasants where 1% of the population owns almost half of the land ;he comes to the rescue of the emigrants cooped in like animals in Calais ,waiting to head for England (not in a hurry to welcome them);he shares their food ,not the high and mighty's miniature pastries ,and their straw mattress.He is good friends with Charles whose family likes him too ,although he's too leftist .But the viewer sides with him :\n\nTemporary stricken with remorse , Charles who did not lift a finger to help his fellow men,too busy with his broadcasts,his scouts ,his books ,the receptions his love affair ; he wants to confess him to his devoted friend .And that' s it.Nothing will stop him on his way to the bishop's palace ....\n\nMarion Sarraut ,the seasoned director (who has done a lot of work for TV) , does not take sides ;it seems that she approves of the mother's obnoxious behavior ; the ending fails totally to convince .\n\nI was brought up a catholic and I went to Sunday school for long years;now I stand aloof from this religion ; if all the priests were like Frederico,the good Samaritan......"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-30","keywords":"female nudity,topless female nudity,sex scene,washing up","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2720118/","name":"Stanley Weber"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7230577/","name":"Mathilde Ollivier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479628/","name":"Dominique Labourier"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765532/","name":"Marion Sarraut"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011409/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0125554/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0124813/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456997/","name":"Jacques Kirsner"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As I wrote above ,the affair between a handsome priest and a lovely nun is only a detail in a dense screenplay :it's really love at first sight , the nun lets her hair down and presto ,they act .One must note that the marriage for catholic priests (the protestant ministers do ,I personally attended a baptism held but a female minister )is hardly brought up ,which is amazing all the same (although pope François is modern,there are many conservatives among the cardinals ,one hears ....)\n\n In direct contrast with this bourgeois religious people , we have Frederico ,the black priest:he's the only one who does what the Gospels told us a long time ago; he denounces the sad fate of Brazilian's peasants where 1% of the population owns almost half of the land ;he comes to the rescue of the emigrants cooped in like animals in Calais ,waiting to head for England (not in a hurry to welcome them);he shares their food ,not the high and mighty's miniature pastries ,and their straw mattress.He is good friends with Charles whose family likes him too ,although he's too leftist .But the viewer sides with him :\n\nTemporary stricken with remorse , Charles who did not lift a finger to help his fellow men,too busy with his broadcasts,his scouts ,his books ,the receptions his love affair ; he wants to confess him to his devoted friend .And that' s it.Nothing will stop him on his way to the bishop's palace ....\n\nMarion Sarraut ,the seasoned director (who has done a lot of work for TV) , does not take sides ;it seems that she approves of the mother's obnoxious behavior ; the ending fails totally to convince .\n\nI was brought up a catholic and I went to Sunday school for long years;now I stand aloof from this religion ; if all the priests were like Frederico,the good Samaritan......","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-30","keywords":"female nudity,topless female nudity,sex scene,washing up","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2720118/","name":"Stanley Weber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7230577/","name":"Mathilde Ollivier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479628/","name":"Dominique Labourier"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765532/","name":"Marion Sarraut"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011409/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0125554/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0124813/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456997/","name":"Jacques Kirsner"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Vincent Cassel gives a fine performance as the acclaimed artist Paul Gauguin, who unable to sell his paintings in France, leaves his family in Paris to find inspiration for his work on the island of Tahiti.\n\nThere he meets the Tahitian beauty Tehura (Tuhei Adams), who, while living together, begins to pose for Gauguin's paintings and sketches. However, despite the lush atmospherics of it all, Gauguin finds himself still impoverished, in failing health, and becoming more and possessive and selfish when it comes to young Tehura. The envisioned idyllic life is slipping away.\n\nOverall, despite the powerful performances from Cassel and the debut of Adams, the movie to me just became mostly a slog, although, at times, it seems to come together nicely, but those moments are too few and far between. Thus, just a fair rating for me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2017-09-20","keywords":"painter,artist,starving artist,paris france,year 1891","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Gauguin: Voyage to Tahiti","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1626389273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2MTU5NGYtMDJjOC00NDhhLTk2NDQtNmExOGRkYjRhZjgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2MTU5NGYtMDJjOC00NDhhLTk2NDQtNmExOGRkYjRhZjgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9225337/","name":"Tuheï Adams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956026/","name":"Malik Zidi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435120/","name":"Edouard Deluc"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065288/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0650953/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435120/","name":"Edouard Deluc"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0173541/","name":"Etienne Comar"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1662707/","name":"Thomas Lilti"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Vincent Cassel gives a fine performance as the acclaimed artist Paul Gauguin, who unable to sell his paintings in France, leaves his family in Paris to find inspiration for his work on the island of Tahiti.\n\nThere he meets the Tahitian beauty Tehura (Tuhei Adams), who, while living together, begins to pose for Gauguin's paintings and sketches. However, despite the lush atmospherics of it all, Gauguin finds himself still impoverished, in failing health, and becoming more and possessive and selfish when it comes to young Tehura. The envisioned idyllic life is slipping away.\n\nOverall, despite the powerful performances from Cassel and the debut of Adams, the movie to me just became mostly a slog, although, at times, it seems to come together nicely, but those moments are too few and far between. Thus, just a fair rating for me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2017-09-20","keywords":"painter,artist,starving artist,paris france,year 1891","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Gauguin: Voyage to Tahiti","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1626389273","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2MTU5NGYtMDJjOC00NDhhLTk2NDQtNmExOGRkYjRhZjgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2MTU5NGYtMDJjOC00NDhhLTk2NDQtNmExOGRkYjRhZjgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9225337/","name":"Tuheï Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956026/","name":"Malik Zidi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435120/","name":"Edouard Deluc"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065288/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0650953/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435120/","name":"Edouard Deluc","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0173541/","name":"Etienne Comar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1662707/","name":"Thomas Lilti"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's definitely one of the most depressing films I've ever seen.\n\nManchester by the Sea tells the story of a depressed man named Lee who has to take care of his brother's son after his unfortunate death.\n\nThis is not a film that you go to watch for a good time. Manchester by the Sea made me feel really sad throughout the entirety of it and it's mainly done through the amazing performances and level of authenticity writer-director Kenneth Lonergan creates. This film is very simple. It's not stylish in any way and Lonergan's script maintains the realism through the runtime.

This made Lonergan's story about guilt, pain and depression more impactful and heartbreaking.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a career best performance by Casey Affleck. It's a performance that's rather sombre instead of flashy. His facial expressions are very subtle but you can still tell how broken and unhappy of a man he is. When you first see his character, you tend to dislike him but after finding out the reason why he's so miserable, you root for him and want him to recover from his depressive state. Michelle Williams isn't in the film much but she's brilliant in all the scenes she's present in. I thought Lucas Hedges was good but there were times where I found his accent quite jarring and a scene where he cries didn't seem too realistic.\n\nIt's best going into Manchester by the Sea not knowing much as I feel it makes the film more poignant.

It is an updated version of Thomas Hardy's Far from the Madding Crowd but based on a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds. A dark comedy set in the English countryside, the story is centred on a writer's colony run by Tamsin Greig's character Beth and her crime writer husband Nicholas, played by Roger Allam.\n\nGemma Arteton plays the title character who lived in the same small down in Dorset known as Ewedown during her teenage years. Now grown up she returns to restore and hopefully sell the house she used to live in. With help from a surgically reconstructed nose, Tamara Drewe has blossomed into a beautiful woman and her presence shakes the sleepy town as Bethsheba did in Hardy's novel.\n\nThe film is true to the memory of Thomas Hardy maintaining the turmoil of sexual desire and even obsession across all age groups which so commonly adorned his novels. One of the characters, the sympathetic American novelist Glen played by Bill Camp is writing a novel influenced by Hardy and references the author on many occasions.\n\nThe film breaks the notion of a quiet and sleepy town, like so many British films do. Underneath these seemingly close communities lies an underlining suspicion. Everyone is in everyone else's business in Ewedown and Tamara's presence only helps fuel the tension.\n\nThe pivotal scene that embodies Tamara Drewe's character occurs when Glen tells her that life must be very easy for her because she is beautiful. She laughs it off citing that it has always been difficult for her to be taken seriously.\n\nBehind the character of Tamara Drewe lies something more sinister. The sudden appearance of a beautiful face in the town leads to a series of events that causes the balance of everyone's life to be upset. Men are suddenly smitten by the prospect of sex while women are often jealous or angry by the disruption they cause.\n\nThe story really begins to escalate when Tamara begins to date a drummer in a rock band played by Dominic Cooper and sets up permanently in the town. Soon, everyone in the town is invested in the lives of these people in some way.\n\nThe voyeurism of the locals who regard Tamara Drewe as both someone to envy and detest is likened to the celebrity status of her rock star boyfriend. Tamara quickly becomes the target of two schoolgirls who are both obsessed with the drummer and jealous of Tamara for disturbing the order of things.\n\nThe film eases its dark themes with its excellent use of subtle humour. The updated version of one of Hardy's most celebrated novels exposes the reality of a voyeuristic society too concerned with the lives of other people.\n\nAlong with Frears excellent direction, the other great strength of this film is its actors with special distinction going to Tamsin Greig. Greig is familiar to the London stage scene while others have played minor roles in big films. Gemma Arteton was one of Bond's muses in the Quantum of Solace. Roger Allam has been equally excellent in Frears academy award winning film the Queen as well as in V for Vendetta.\n\nOn one final note, I read one review that argued that the climax just does not amount to much which I personally felt was very misguided.

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father.

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure.

Tom Crusie does good work here. Colin turns in a deliciously nasty performance. However the film belongs to Max Von Sydow who is absolutely genius here.

John thinks that an agent named Danny  (Colin Farrell) who is investigating the the unit is trying to set him up. To add to the problems, the person John is accused of trying to murder is a person he does not even know and it says John will kill him in 48 hours.\n\nFast paced, exciting and deeply moving &amp; thought provoking film. Tom Crusie does good work here. Colin turns in a deliciously nasty performance. However the film belongs to Max Von Sydow who is absolutely genius here. Director Speilberg treats the audience to some highly original and creative visual effects and has presented us with a fun story that covers all the bases. The ending is especially good. \n\nRated PG-13; Violence and Profanity.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":524231,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2002-09-18","keywords":"year 2054,future noir,neo noir,washington d.c.,psychic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Minority Report","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3333161241","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhMjlhYTItMzViYi00ODFiLTlhNTAtYzQyYzM5ZmM4MDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhMjlhYTItMzViYi00ODFiLTlhNTAtYzQyYzM5ZmM4MDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0608090/","name":"Samantha Morton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012382/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001140/","name":"Philip K.

Watching it online, I was very taken with Madagascar 3. For me, it is the best of the three movies, and as far as the Dreamworks sequels go, it is third behind Kung Fu Panda 2 and Shrek 2. Madagascar 3 is not a movie I deem perfect, there is some suggestive dialogue during King Julien's romance especially(and in other parts of the film) that will fly over children's heads and only adults will get(same goes with the glove slap) and you do have to suspend disbelief a bit in Alex's dream when the penguins use warp drive for their airship(which you can't do in the earth's atmosphere), especially if you are a scientist.\n\nOn the other hand, it is a fun and hugely enjoyable film. It is the best-looking of the three films, the previous two looked great as well but here the characters move easier, the colours have brightness and warmth and the backgrounds have a great deal of detail. Especially of note is the animation during Katy Perry's Fireworks, splendid in all regards. The soundtrack is also great, varied in that it spans 30 years and full of exuberance. Firework I am not a fan of, but loved the animation and thought it fitted really well within the film. The dialogue is well written and hilarious, with light, subtle spoofing on other films and also on the Hollywood clichés.\n\nThe story is well paced, exciting and of the three Madagascar it is the most consistent and least predictable. King Julien's romance was on the bizarre side, but also sweet and hilarious. The characters are great fun, of the four main characters Alex is the most dominant and he's fun. Marty, Gloria and Melman don't have as much to do but they aren't completely side-lined. The penguins and King Julien steal every scene they're in. And the new characters are just delightful, especially Vitaly and DuBois. The voice acting is top notch, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith and David Schwimmer all do very appealing jobs. Sacha Baron Cohen is as witty as ever as King Julien, likewise with the penguins with Tom McGrath standing out as Skipper. The dogs are fun too. Bryan Cranston is subtly menacing, Jessica Chastain is charming and Martin Short is funny, but the jewel(and possibly the best single voice-over of the three movies) is Frances McDormand, whose DuBois is note-perfect.\n\nIn conclusion, a very good sequel and movie and my vote for the best of the Madagascar movies. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":169583,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-06-13","keywords":"animal,circus,penguin,lemur,giraffe","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1169137689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTkxMDU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU0NzIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTkxMDU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU0NzIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo join a traveling circus in an effort to get back home to New York."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000586/","name":"Jada Pinkett Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001674/","name":"Chris Rock"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201509/","name":"Eric Darnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569891/","name":"Tom McGrath"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0970447/","name":"Conrad Vernon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201509/","name":"Eric Darnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000876/","name":"Noah Baumbach"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123666/","name":"Mark Burton"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Watching it online, I was very taken with Madagascar 3. For me, it is the best of the three movies, and as far as the Dreamworks sequels go, it is third behind Kung Fu Panda 2 and Shrek 2. Madagascar 3 is not a movie I deem perfect, there is some suggestive dialogue during King Julien's romance especially(and in other parts of the film) that will fly over children's heads and only adults will get(same goes with the glove slap) and you do have to suspend disbelief a bit in Alex's dream when the penguins use warp drive for their airship(which you can't do in the earth's atmosphere), especially if you are a scientist.\n\nOn the other hand, it is a fun and hugely enjoyable film. It is the best-looking of the three films, the previous two looked great as well but here the characters move easier, the colours have brightness and warmth and the backgrounds have a great deal of detail. Especially of note is the animation during Katy Perry's Fireworks, splendid in all regards. The soundtrack is also great, varied in that it spans 30 years and full of exuberance. Firework I am not a fan of, but loved the animation and thought it fitted really well within the film. The dialogue is well written and hilarious, with light, subtle spoofing on other films and also on the Hollywood clichés.\n\nThe story is well paced, exciting and of the three Madagascar it is the most consistent and least predictable. King Julien's romance was on the bizarre side, but also sweet and hilarious. The characters are great fun, of the four main characters Alex is the most dominant and he's fun. Marty, Gloria and Melman don't have as much to do but they aren't completely side-lined. The penguins and King Julien steal every scene they're in. And the new characters are just delightful, especially Vitaly and DuBois. The voice acting is top notch, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith and David Schwimmer all do very appealing jobs. Sacha Baron Cohen is as witty as ever as King Julien, likewise with the penguins with Tom McGrath standing out as Skipper. The dogs are fun too. Bryan Cranston is subtly menacing, Jessica Chastain is charming and Martin Short is funny, but the jewel(and possibly the best single voice-over of the three movies) is Frances McDormand, whose DuBois is note-perfect.\n\nIn conclusion, a very good sequel and movie and my vote for the best of the Madagascar movies. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":169583,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-06-13","keywords":"animal,circus,penguin,lemur,giraffe","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1169137689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTkxMDU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU0NzIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTkxMDU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU0NzIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo join a traveling circus in an effort to get back home to New York.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000586/","name":"Jada Pinkett Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001674/","name":"Chris Rock"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201509/","name":"Eric Darnell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569891/","name":"Tom McGrath","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0970447/","name":"Conrad Vernon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201509/","name":"Eric Darnell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000876/","name":"Noah Baumbach","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123666/","name":"Mark Burton"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The following day , the paper reported the arrest of the murderer,  thanks in part to the quick action of one of the motel residents.  While the police were securing the crime scene, one of the by-standers was approached by a man who asked her what was going on. When she told him about the body, he ran across the street and jumped onto a waiting van.  She later told a newspaper reporter that she had "watched enough "Law and Order" episodes to know suspicious behavior when she sees it."  She got out her camera-phone and starting taking photographs of the man and the license plate on the van.  The police downloaded the photos, tracked down the van, connected all the dots,  and had the killer in custody 39 hours after the discovery of the body.

The story is a bit too long, specifically the very beginning and the part before the plot.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-02-21","keywords":"body","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1286724/","name":"Yoann Blanc","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4978674/","name":"Jasmina Douieb","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2727232/","name":"Lara Hubinont"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150005/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011677/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2809451/","name":"Stéphane Bergmans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2860392/","name":"Benjamin d'Aoust","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950061/","name":"Matthieu Donck"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3237069081","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk0OWRhYTItMmIwOC00OGJlLWFkNmQtNmYwNWI1NmFiZmQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjk0OWRhYTItMmIwOC00OGJlLWFkNmQtNmYwNWI1NmFiZmQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="de">1. Staffel, Folge 3: Chirurg Dr. John Thackery (Clive Owen) bekommt überraschenden Besuch von einer ehemaligen Geliebten. Doch Abigail (Jennifer Ferrin) ist kaum wiederzuerkennen: Ihr Gesicht zeigt unübersehbare Symptome einer Syphilis, die Thackery nun behandeln soll. Krankenhausverwalter Herman Barrow (Jeremy Bobb) plagt indes ein ganz spezieller Ressourcenmangel: Die für Thackerys Forschung benötigten Leichen werden knapp - und die halblegalen Methoden, zu denen Barrow in der Not greift, bringen ihn immer mehr in Bedrängnis. - Düster, blutig, verstörend: Steven Soderberghs schonungslos realistische Serie über ein New Yorker Krankenhaus um 1900. 52 Min.USA 2014. Von Steven Soderbergh, mit Clive Owen, Andre Holland, Eve Hewson.Ab 12 Jahren.</desc>

Century","reviewBody":"Wow. This new show certainly knows how to get your attention. Within the first five minutes of the first episode you will have a very clear picture of what it meant to have to undergo surgery at a time when even today's most common surgical procedures had hardly been tested – let alone successfully. With this new series, writers Jack Amiel and Michael Begler have created a fascinating – and gripping – look at the humble beginnings of modern medicine, and frankly: it made me realize just how lucky I am to live today. \n\nThe show's title is derived from the 'Knickerbocker Hospital', a fictional hospital at the turn of the 20th. century in New York which serves as the centre stage around which the lives and struggles of the protagonists revolve. 'The Nick' shows us an uneasy, turbulent time where everything is in motion, and although the benefits of the so called "modern age" are already waiting around the corner, the situation for people without money is grim. Immigrants live in horrible sanitary situations, little children have to work in factories and social frictions and racial prejudice run deep within society.\n\nClive Owen does an excellent job portraying a conflicted but passionate surgeon who's constantly trying to push the boundaries by inventing or refining surgical methods in the hope of lowering the mortality rate among his patients. The rest of the cast is also terrific; their performances - along with the great writing - help create a sense of realism that is rarely seen in films or TV-shows depicting that era. The same can be said of the fantastic production values – the team behind 'The Knick' obviously went to great lengths to portray everyday life of that era as accurately as possible. Virtually every frame oozes quality: the city of New York at the beginning of the twentieth century has been meticulously recreated and every busy street corner, alley or candle-lit room feels authentic. Small wonder, perhaps, given that the director, producer, cinematographer and editor of all 20 episodes is none other than multi-talent and Oscar winner Steven Soderbergh.\n\nMy verdict: This is a fascinating, gripping portrayal of the dawn of modern surgery as well as an intense human drama and an authentic look at an era we normally only get to see in films about Sherlock Holmes or Jack the Ripper. Highly recommended. 9 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2014-08-08","keywords":"1900s,surgeon,doctor,hospital,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2428245/","name":"André Holland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2205243/","name":"Jeremy Bobb"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017525/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024856/","name":"Jack Amiel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0066764/","name":"Michael Begler"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2103030553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQzMDk1OTkxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc5MjEwNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjQzMDk1OTkxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc5MjEwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Season 2 trailer for "The Knick"."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He told me it was called "Big Love" and I should catch it. Well, now having watched the first two seasons, I can confidently say this is the best television show I've seen in years. The polygamy is not even close to what the show's all about-- even though that part is extremely interesting.\n\nFirst off, Bill Paxton is charged with a tough duty-- he's really the backbone of the show, and he is flawless scene after scene after scene. The same can be said of Tripplehorn, Sevigny and Goodwin. Amanda Seyfriend also really shines in a quiet but emotionally conflicted role as the teenage daughter battling religious self-esteem and monogamy vs polygamy for a life path. Douglas Smith demonstrates great promise as a young actor whose character is in a state of constant awkwardness and whose introverted nature is taken to the backseat when a great personal challenge for him begins to arise in the second season.\n\nThe stories are fantastic, with wonderful characters at every level. Harry Dean Stanton as Roman Grant is an absolute masterclass in acting; his tiny, shriveled exterior does nothing to prevent us from fearing his powerful, commanding leadership role as the so-called prophet of the compound.\n\nBoasting plot lines consistently intriguing and aiding in character development rather than mere shock value, it refuses to make overt caricatures out of characters easy to keep one-dimensional. For me personally as an atheist who is fascinated with the study of theology, it's rousing fun to cheer for the polygamist and his loving family. The part that sucks me in the most is definitely the "right" decisions characters make, albeit justified with religious convictions. Don't just "give it a chance"-- watch it and you will love it. It's smart, funny, emotionally impacting and extremely well-written.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20751,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-03-12","keywords":"polygamist,large family,gay mormon,polygamy,secret","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000200/","name":"Bill Paxton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000675/","name":"Jeanne Tripplehorn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001721/","name":"Chloë Sevigny"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050662/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036575/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0647739/","name":"Mark V.

Great actors with interesting storylines, it had the perfect amount of humor and heart to go along with the brutal cases brought into the hospital. But then it started to lose it's heart, characters became extremely annoying, and the personal issues of the characters became exhausting as they never seemed to change. Grey's Anatomy had a great cast to start with, then they took those characters and slowly made them unbearable to stand. While eventually getting rid of some of the best actors on the show to replace them with people who you will not be able to tolerate for very long. I wish this show would focus more on the medicine aspect and less on the personal lives of the doctors. It would be nice if they would clean up the cast and get better actors with better storylines or just end the show! 15 seasons is a bit much.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":269775,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They could have expanded more, but people should not be so quick to leave a review after only seeing 60 minutes of a season series. So far I have only viewed the pilot and the first episode, but I am anticipating it will get high reviews. Anyone who enjoys watching the TV series Scandal, should enjoy this series as well. Scandal is quite violent and into shock value. To compare the two shows I find the writing far superior. Tea Leoni was an excellent choice. She is a wonderful actor and I have enjoyed all her movies. She can make you feel the emotions of the script every time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20983,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-21","keywords":"politician,secretary of state,chief of staff,political conflict,politics","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000495/","name":"Téa Leoni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004857/","name":"Tim Daly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2706992/","name":"Erich Bergen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0111281/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075256/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355329/","name":"Barbara Hall"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Madam Secretary: Series Premiere","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4153522201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY2OWVmZDctNzBiYy00YjEyLWIxZjItZGNkM2I4YTlhODYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY2OWVmZDctNzBiYy00YjEyLWIxZjItZGNkM2I4YTlhODYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"First Look Trailer"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The streets are full of insurgents attempting a violent uprising against the democratically elected president, who is now in the care of the US within the embassy. However with the insurgents laying siege outside and rescue many hours away, options for survival and limited and Keenan comes under pressure from without and within.\n\nIn a way I suppose we should see it as Van Damme returning to Europe to use his American-found fame to bolster film-making in Europe, however another way to see it is that his appeal has dwindled badly and he has taken to doing basic action films in Eastern European to squeeze every last penny out of the budget. Watching this film among others, it is hard to avoid the fact that the truth is almost undoubtedly the latter. The plot is fairly basic but in essence it is a war-zone version of Assault on Precinct 13. So what we are a looking for is a ratcheting up of tension across the film, with the silence being harder to watch than the action  which by extension is more exciting for its quality as payoff.\n\nSadly that is not what the film delivers because instead everything is played out as basic as you like, with minimal tension, obvious plotting, wooden acting and action that plays like they all just hoped having shots of gunfire would be sufficient to justify it as an "action film". It is never awful by any means and indeed for those trawling the cable listings looking for something to have on like visual wallpaper, you could do much worse. But this is hardly praise and all through the film I never shook the feeling of it being a cu-price low rent affair with no aspirations beyond the bottom shelf of the video store and maybe a 2am slot on a cable station. Obviously there is a limited amount of money to play with but this is only an excuse for scale  not for how good a film it is and director Fellows isn't able to do much. His cast don't help, with Van Damme on auto-pilot (without even much action to speak of for him), Cox filling a tired cliché of a female role and nobody else making an impression even if they had been given the material. The Eastern European villains are so bland and generic that even modern video games can produce a more realistic cast of characters.\n\nSecond in Command will be found on poor slots on so-so TV stations, was made in Eastern Europe and stars Jean-Claude Van Damme so really one could say that the clues are all right there for you to see for yourself. If you do decide to watch it then please note that it does live up to the low standards it suggests it will have and, while too bland to be really awful, there isn't much about it worth seeing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6303,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The streets are full of insurgents attempting a violent uprising against the democratically elected president, who is now in the care of the US within the embassy. However with the insurgents laying siege outside and rescue many hours away, options for survival and limited and Keenan comes under pressure from without and within.\n\nIn a way I suppose we should see it as Van Damme returning to Europe to use his American-found fame to bolster film-making in Europe, however another way to see it is that his appeal has dwindled badly and he has taken to doing basic action films in Eastern European to squeeze every last penny out of the budget. Watching this film among others, it is hard to avoid the fact that the truth is almost undoubtedly the latter. The plot is fairly basic but in essence it is a war-zone version of Assault on Precinct 13. So what we are a looking for is a ratcheting up of tension across the film, with the silence being harder to watch than the action  which by extension is more exciting for its quality as payoff.\n\nSadly that is not what the film delivers because instead everything is played out as basic as you like, with minimal tension, obvious plotting, wooden acting and action that plays like they all just hoped having shots of gunfire would be sufficient to justify it as an "action film". It is never awful by any means and indeed for those trawling the cable listings looking for something to have on like visual wallpaper, you could do much worse. But this is hardly praise and all through the film I never shook the feeling of it being a cu-price low rent affair with no aspirations beyond the bottom shelf of the video store and maybe a 2am slot on a cable station. Obviously there is a limited amount of money to play with but this is only an excuse for scale  not for how good a film it is and director Fellows isn't able to do much. His cast don't help, with Van Damme on auto-pilot (without even much action to speak of for him), Cox filling a tired cliché of a female role and nobody else making an impression even if they had been given the material. The Eastern European villains are so bland and generic that even modern video games can produce a more realistic cast of characters.\n\nSecond in Command will be found on poor slots on so-so TV stations, was made in Eastern Europe and stars Jean-Claude Van Damme so really one could say that the clues are all right there for you to see for yourself. If you do decide to watch it then please note that it does live up to the low standards it suggests it will have and, while too bland to be really awful, there isn't much about it worth seeing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6303,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's a fairly easy genre to master, and an easy way to make a good movie. This is one of the best examples, since Smith and Lawrence really do compliment each other so well; Smith's the sleek, cool one who is popular with the ladies, while Lawrence is often nervous, and pretty much a direct opposite of Smith. They have pretty good on-screen chemistry, too; you believe that these are good friends and partners. My only real problem with the film is the way the comedy almost all is generated by stereotypes, and, worse, the age-old complications that arise from certain situations.

What kept me engaged was trying to guess how things would play out for the family and which side would come out on top in the end. The redemption story for Chad and Bruce (Frank and Rich) was the obvious central aspect. It was well done and had a nice conclusion to it that felt genuine. There's a couple violent scenes but it never crosses the line into all out gore. Worth a stream if you're into more dramatic thrillers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9970,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-05-22","keywords":"action thriller,family held hostage,home break in,car chase,brother brother relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Survive the Night","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1010286105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMxZGYxZTUtNjYzMy00M2Y2LWExOTctMDdhNmIwMzg3OTQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmMxZGYxZTUtNjYzMy00M2Y2LWExOTctMDdhNmIwMzg3OTQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614877/","name":"Chad Michael Murray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6125709/","name":"Shea Buckner"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1760759/","name":"Matt Eskandari"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017712/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274103/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0735561/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10679575/","name":"Doug Wolfe"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

No, this particular take on the story of Robin Hood is very different - like none you've ever seen before. Even the historical setting is changed from what's usually offered. Here, rather than waiting out the evil regency of Prince John and his minions until King Richard returns from the Crusades, Richard is already dead. His death comes very early on in the movie in battle in France. John is the King of England in this movie, and rather than an unselfish "robbing the rich to give to the poor" type character, Robin (actually in this movie Robin Longstride, who finds himself impersonating Robert of Locksley and becomes known as "Robin of the Hood") is a more complex character. I wouldn't say exactly noble - especially in the beginning - and his battle is not so much for the poor as it's a battle for the "rights" of the English people, as he eventually takes on what seems to be the fight to get John to sign what I assume is Magna Carta, and at least temporarily has to ally himself with John to help lead the defence of England against a French invasion.\n\nThe different historical setting is a bit disorienting to be honest - especially at first - but it also gives a degree of unpredictability to what's going to happen, and once you get a sense of where you are, when you are and what the fight is about it's easy enough to understand what's going on. Russell Crowe did a commendable job, I thought, in this alternate portrayal of Robin, and Cate Blanchett was most certainly a different kind of Marion. She's not the Maid Marion of legend. She's tough, she's a fighter, she goes into battle with the French - although not leading the battle, there's almost a Joan of Arc quality to her (minus the voice of God.) I was quite taken with Oscar Isaac as King John. He took the part and made it real. John came across as I would expect him to from the historical record - shifty and conniving, untrustworthy, quite willing to make and break whatever alliances are necessary at any given moment to ensure his survival as King and sometimes quite befuddled by his responsibilities. Perhaps a weakness was the fact that there was no real focus on Robin's men. Really only Will Scarlett (played by Scott Grimes) and Friar Tuck (played by Mark Addy) were significant elements in the story, and even they weren't particularly important.\n\nThe sets and setting were good. This felt like I imagine England in the late 12th-early 13th centuries would have felt like. Rough, brutal, dirty. It worked for me. The battle scenes (and there are a lot of them) are very well done. Since the movie ends with the caption "And so the legend begins" one wonders if a sequel might be in the works, perhaps detailing the struggle leading up to the actually signing of Magna Carta? If so, I'd definitely watch it. This was quite good!

I think it shows just what women are capable of. If u haven't seen it i strongly recommend it. It remains at the top of my list and i've seen many award winning movies. It is filled with an amazing cast. It will make u cry and the best part is that there are some true facts. There was this league of women made after most male baseball players had gone to fight in the war. There's romance, fighting, comedy, and some dancing. I mean it has everything a movie needs to be enjoyable. Believe me it wont be a waste of time. You can watch this movie with family and friends.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96653,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A working guy (Andrew Garfield), who is evicted from his home, attempts to make his way up the capitalist dungheap by making himself useful to the guy (Michael Shannon) whose company oversaw the eviction.\n\nAndrew Garfield is not obvious casting for this blue-collar role, but he is a sympathetic presence. He wears his vulnerability so openly, like a contemporary Anthony Perkins, that you can't help but feel for his character as he digs himself deeper and deeper into the mire. Michael Shannon, superb, is only too believable as a man who strives to have no conscience.\n\nThere is no doubt that Bahrani is a fine filmmaker, and I'm sure there'll be more high-standard stuff to come from him. His observation of male behaviour when under pressure is acute and compassionate. His weak spot, on the basis of the two movies of his that I've seen, is that his female characters are so insubstantial. The excellent Laura Dern does her best here with not much to go on.\n\nThere is also an excellent supporting performance from Noah Lomax as Garfield's young son.\n\nWell worth seeing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32052,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-09","keywords":"motel,cheating,ethics,theft,promise","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi775204889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2NDQ3NzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0OTg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2NDQ3NzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0OTg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Charismatic and ruthless businessman Rick Carver is making a killing by repossessing homes - gaming the real estate market, Wall Street banks and the US government.

A working guy (Andrew Garfield), who is evicted from his home, attempts to make his way up the capitalist dungheap by making himself useful to the guy (Michael Shannon) whose company oversaw the eviction.\n\nAndrew Garfield is not obvious casting for this blue-collar role, but he is a sympathetic presence. He wears his vulnerability so openly, like a contemporary Anthony Perkins, that you can't help but feel for his character as he digs himself deeper and deeper into the mire. Michael Shannon, superb, is only too believable as a man who strives to have no conscience.\n\nThere is no doubt that Bahrani is a fine filmmaker, and I'm sure there'll be more high-standard stuff to come from him. His observation of male behaviour when under pressure is acute and compassionate. His weak spot, on the basis of the two movies of his that I've seen, is that his female characters are so insubstantial. The excellent Laura Dern does her best here with not much to go on.\n\nThere is also an excellent supporting performance from Noah Lomax as Garfield's young son.\n\nWell worth seeing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32052,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-09","keywords":"motel,cheating,ethics,theft,promise","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi775204889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2NDQ3NzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0OTg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2NDQ3NzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0OTg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Charismatic and ruthless businessman Rick Carver is making a killing by repossessing homes - gaming the real estate market, Wall Street banks and the US government. When he evicts Dennis Nash, a single father trying to care for his mother and young son, Nash becomes so desperate to provide for his family that he goes to work for Carver - the very man who evicted him in the first place. Carver promises Nash a way to regain his home and earn security for his family, but slyly seduces him into a lifestyle of wealth and glamour. It is a deal-with-the-devil that comes with an increasingly high cost - on Carver's orders, Nash must evict families from their homes. As Nash falls deeper into Carver's web, he finds his situation grows more brutal and dangerous than he ever imagined.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0788335/","name":"Michael Shannon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000368/","name":"Laura Dern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1023919/","name":"Ramin Bahrani"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0471578/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036225/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251916/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1023919/","name":"Ramin Bahrani","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2478512/","name":"Bahareh Azimi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0618881/","name":"Amir Naderi"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A working guy (Andrew Garfield), who is evicted from his home, attempts to make his way up the capitalist dungheap by making himself useful to the guy (Michael Shannon) whose company oversaw the eviction.\n\nAndrew Garfield is not obvious casting for this blue-collar role, but he is a sympathetic presence. He wears his vulnerability so openly, like a contemporary Anthony Perkins, that you can't help but feel for his character as he digs himself deeper and deeper into the mire. Michael Shannon, superb, is only too believable as a man who strives to have no conscience.\n\nThere is no doubt that Bahrani is a fine filmmaker, and I'm sure there'll be more high-standard stuff to come from him. His observation of male behaviour when under pressure is acute and compassionate. His weak spot, on the basis of the two movies of his that I've seen, is that his female characters are so insubstantial. The excellent Laura Dern does her best here with not much to go on.\n\nThere is also an excellent supporting performance from Noah Lomax as Garfield's young son.\n\nWell worth seeing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32052,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-09","keywords":"motel,cheating,ethics,theft,promise","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi775204889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2NDQ3NzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0OTg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2NDQ3NzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0OTg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Charismatic and ruthless businessman Rick Carver is making a killing by repossessing homes - gaming the real estate market, Wall Street banks and the US government.

A working guy (Andrew Garfield), who is evicted from his home, attempts to make his way up the capitalist dungheap by making himself useful to the guy (Michael Shannon) whose company oversaw the eviction.\n\nAndrew Garfield is not obvious casting for this blue-collar role, but he is a sympathetic presence. He wears his vulnerability so openly, like a contemporary Anthony Perkins, that you can't help but feel for his character as he digs himself deeper and deeper into the mire. Michael Shannon, superb, is only too believable as a man who strives to have no conscience.\n\nThere is no doubt that Bahrani is a fine filmmaker, and I'm sure there'll be more high-standard stuff to come from him. His observation of male behaviour when under pressure is acute and compassionate. His weak spot, on the basis of the two movies of his that I've seen, is that his female characters are so insubstantial. The excellent Laura Dern does her best here with not much to go on.\n\nThere is also an excellent supporting performance from Noah Lomax as Garfield's young son.\n\nWell worth seeing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32052,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-09","keywords":"motel,cheating,ethics,theft,promise","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi775204889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2NDQ3NzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0OTg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjY2NDQ3NzE1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjE0OTg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Charismatic and ruthless businessman Rick Carver is making a killing by repossessing homes - gaming the real estate market, Wall Street banks and the US government. When he evicts Dennis Nash, a single father trying to care for his mother and young son, Nash becomes so desperate to provide for his family that he goes to work for Carver - the very man who evicted him in the first place. Carver promises Nash a way to regain his home and earn security for his family, but slyly seduces him into a lifestyle of wealth and glamour. It is a deal-with-the-devil that comes with an increasingly high cost - on Carver's orders, Nash must evict families from their homes. As Nash falls deeper into Carver's web, he finds his situation grows more brutal and dangerous than he ever imagined.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0788335/","name":"Michael Shannon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000368/","name":"Laura Dern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1023919/","name":"Ramin Bahrani"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0471578/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036225/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251916/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1023919/","name":"Ramin Bahrani","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2478512/","name":"Bahareh Azimi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0618881/","name":"Amir Naderi"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy ("Cheaper by the Dozen") or dark and abstruse ("The Royal Tenenbaums"). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is "Little Miss Sunshine", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.\n\nThe title stems from a beauty pageant in which seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin of "Signs") competes. For a good portion of the film, the contest serves as a MacGuffin of sorts, putting an already odd mix of family members on the road in bizarre situations that call Vegas Vacation to mind.\n\nBut "Sunshine" is far more than the slapstick of "Vacation". It mixes humor both broad and subtle humor into a strange brew of comedy, poignancy, lessons, and life. Huge and deep issues are addressed, topics like death, dreams, and failure. Yet somehow the movie doesn't feel heavy. You'll walk out with a smile on your face because the movie sensibly touches on these issues, realizing that stuff happens and life continues, that the handling of adversity is often what defines people. And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.\n\n"Sunshine" may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.\n\nRather crude at times, "Sunshine" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.\n\nBottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":451870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"beauty pageant,cross country trip,gay,drugs,graduate student","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Little Miss Sunshine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3667263769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001057/","name":"Toni Collette"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206760/","name":"Jonathan Dayton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267512/","name":"Valerie Faris"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148020/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063938/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1578335/","name":"Michael Arndt"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.\n\n"Sunshine" may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.\n\nRather crude at times, "Sunshine" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.\n\nBottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":451870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"beauty pageant,cross country trip,gay,drugs,graduate student","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Little Miss Sunshine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3667263769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001057/","name":"Toni Collette","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206760/","name":"Jonathan Dayton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267512/","name":"Valerie Faris"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148020/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063938/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1578335/","name":"Michael Arndt"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Hands down.

I'm not going to go into details of the movie in my post because I do not want to spoil it for anyone, but I will tell you this much, bring some tissues with you. Not because the movie is sad, it will be happy tears that you will be wiping away. Just an amazing movie. A masterpiece. I brought my kids to go see it and they loved it. Cane straight home to hug and kiss their dogs. Again....its an amazing movie. One of the best I have ever seen in my entire life. Do not pay attention to these critics who rate the movie low or say anything negative about it, those people are fools. Their job is to critique a movie and look for negatives. Notice the huge discrepancies between rotten tomatoes reviews on movies compared to the public's opinion of a movie........it's always a huge difference. Mark my words, go and see this movie with your kids and family and friends. You guys will not be disappointed. And again, bring some tissues for your happy tears.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20773,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It has to be top 3-5 movies ever. It's up there with movies like Ghost and Lion King. I'm already an animal lover, and huge dog lover, and this movie just gives me more reason to love and cherish my little four legged friends. I'm not going to go into details of the movie in my post because I do not want to spoil it for anyone, but I will tell you this much, bring some tissues with you. Not because the movie is sad, it will be happy tears that you will be wiping away. Just an amazing movie. A masterpiece. I brought my kids to go see it and they loved it. Cane straight home to hug and kiss their dogs. Again....its an amazing movie. One of the best I have ever seen in my entire life. Do not pay attention to these critics who rate the movie low or say anything negative about it, those people are fools. Their job is to critique a movie and look for negatives. Notice the huge discrepancies between rotten tomatoes reviews on movies compared to the public's opinion of a movie........it's always a huge difference. Mark my words, go and see this movie with your kids and family and friends. You guys will not be disappointed. And again, bring some tissues for your happy tears.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20773,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy ("Cheaper by the Dozen") or dark and abstruse ("The Royal Tenenbaums"). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is "Little Miss Sunshine", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.\n\nThe title stems from a beauty pageant in which seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin of "Signs") competes. For a good portion of the film, the contest serves as a MacGuffin of sorts, putting an already odd mix of family members on the road in bizarre situations that call Vegas Vacation to mind.\n\nBut "Sunshine" is far more than the slapstick of "Vacation". It mixes humor both broad and subtle humor into a strange brew of comedy, poignancy, lessons, and life. Huge and deep issues are addressed, topics like death, dreams, and failure. Yet somehow the movie doesn't feel heavy. You'll walk out with a smile on your face because the movie sensibly touches on these issues, realizing that stuff happens and life continues, that the handling of adversity is often what defines people. And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.\n\n"Sunshine" may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.\n\nRather crude at times, "Sunshine" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.\n\nBottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":451870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"beauty pageant,cross country trip,gay,drugs,graduate student","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Little Miss Sunshine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3667263769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001057/","name":"Toni Collette"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206760/","name":"Jonathan Dayton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267512/","name":"Valerie Faris"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148020/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063938/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1578335/","name":"Michael Arndt"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Little Miss Sunshine: Directed by Jonathan Dayton, Valerie Faris. With Abigail Breslin, Greg Kinnear, Paul Dano, Alan Arkin. A family determined to get their young daughter into the finals of a beauty pageant take a cross-country trip in their VW bus." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0449059/","name":"Little Miss Sunshine","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgzNTgzODU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjEyMjMzMQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A family determined to get their young daughter into the finals of a beauty pageant take a cross-country trip in their VW bus.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0449059/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Pavel-8","dateCreated":"2006-12-09","inLanguage":"English","name":"Probably the best comedy of 2006.","reviewBody":"Comedies about families usually come in one of two genres. Often featuring dysfunctional families (are those two words redundant?), they are either broad and goofy ("Cheaper by the Dozen") or dark and abstruse ("The Royal Tenenbaums"). Driving its Volkswagon bus down the middle of these two extremes is "Little Miss Sunshine", a comedy both inclusive and exclusive, one that some will get entirely, while others will whiff on to the same degree.\n\nThe title stems from a beauty pageant in which seven-year old Olive (Abigail Breslin of "Signs") competes. For a good portion of the film, the contest serves as a MacGuffin of sorts, putting an already odd mix of family members on the road in bizarre situations that call Vegas Vacation to mind.\n\nBut "Sunshine" is far more than the slapstick of "Vacation". It mixes humor both broad and subtle humor into a strange brew of comedy, poignancy, lessons, and life. Huge and deep issues are addressed, topics like death, dreams, and failure. Yet somehow the movie doesn't feel heavy. You'll walk out with a smile on your face because the movie sensibly touches on these issues, realizing that stuff happens and life continues, that the handling of adversity is often what defines people. And above all, there is family, which you're stuck with, for better and worse.\n\n"Sunshine" may not grab you right away, which is part of its power. It burns slowly, introducing the family members to the viewing outsiders through observation, then putting the viewers in the bus with them as they enter a foreign world. All this is done without lapsing into melodrama and without losing steam as the movie chugs toward the climactic final scene, continuously building momentum along the way, before promptly getting out on top.\n\nRather crude at times, "Sunshine" is not a movie for children, nor is it for anyone who takes life or movies too seriously. But if you excel at finding the askance humor in life and film, then you will relish this offbeat look at a collection of family dynamics perhaps only slightly stranger than most, although definitely more extreme.\n\nBottom Line: One of the year's best, and likely its best comedy. 8 of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":451870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"beauty pageant,cross country trip,gay,drugs,graduate student","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Little Miss Sunshine","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3667263769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzVlNjdkY2QtM2RkYy00Y2MyLTg0ZGEtNjgyZTdlY2U3NDU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001057/","name":"Toni Collette","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206760/","name":"Jonathan Dayton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267512/","name":"Valerie Faris"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148020/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063938/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1578335/","name":"Michael Arndt"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you've ever watched any World War II POW movies, you'll appreciate all the references here: the POW huts, the British accents, the over-bearing ex-RAF rooster, the solitary confinement, and even the Great Escape references. All good fun for the adult watching.\n\nIt's not a "split your sides laughing" movie, but if you like Wallace and Grommit you'll enjoy this as change of pace from standard animation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181555,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT1H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I would love to thank Clea DuVall for accurately pointing out the emotional complexities of coming out. This film deeply projects the obstacles one faces of coming out to the family and how one can't be truly happy if their true self is hidden. The understanding and the patience of being with someone who is not fully out was tested, love keeps one together but there is always a limit. The perspective of showing two sides of a person was heartbreaking, how devastating to watch how she treated her love for the sake of keeping up appearances due to her family's reputation, and by hiding, she didn't notice the hurt she was causing. Even though it was painful to watch it was understandable because it isn't easy to say it to the family. This was a meaningful film that gave different points of view for one to know that there is hope and that hope is projected through the relationship between Abby and Harper.\n\nI loved this line "Everybody's story is different", a few simple words that defined the difficulties of coming out. During that scene, tears began to flow because it explains in detail how terrifying it was when those words come out while not knowing what would be one's family reaction. Acceptance is a powerful word in which many seek, and not every family knows the meaning of loving a child for who they are. It is easy to be out surrounded by strangers but not easy with family, never knowing if it's the last day one can call them family. All those feelings were profoundly placed in that scene and it made me cry so hard.\n\nIt was very well done to make her family defined by perfection to project as many situations as possible. They wanted to seem perfect but like any other family, they were all struggling to be proud of or to gain love. Everything would be simple if one learns to not let society control one's life and not letting them decide who you are. This storyline tackles every awkwardness, stress, and the terrible pain that causes when one decides to live in a lie.\n\nWhen the high point of the movie came, it was so excruciating, I have cried in many movies but this kind of cry was different. I felt like my heart was intensely crumbling down even as I write this my tears are remembering and I'm so thankful for this movie for letting me cry in this kind of way. I love how this storyline doesn't give a simple solution and doesn't even set any cheesy moment by doing so. The struggle of reaching the limit was perfectly structured by establishing how a secret and denial are two different things in which can have a hurtful consequence.\n\nThe composer Amie Doherty set beautifully a holiday romantic cheery atmosphere. I love the theme music of Abby and Harper it was so cute and it defines the love they have for each other. The new Christmas song of Tegan and Sara (Make You Mine This Season) is perfect for them and the song was added at the right scene.\n\nThe entire cast was perfectly chosen and performed magnificently. The main actors Kristen Stewart as Abby and Mackenzie Davis as Harper, undeniable chemistry and their performance brought up a beautifully much-needed relationship to be told. Abby, the one out, and Harper not fully out delivered the meaning of how life brings barriers toward true happiness and the only thing keeping one from being happy is not friends nor family is oneself. I love how they looked at each other, how attentive and cautious they were to not lose themselves over the secret even though it was inevitable. The way both of them cry was more than acting, it felt so true and natural. Abby's story of the loss she had added more feeling of having a family.\n\nVictor Garber and Mary Steenburgen as the parents projected the bubble of perfection which blinded them from not really seeing nor feeling the truth about their family. Alison Brie as one of Harper's sisters, I like how competitive their relationship was because most of the time sisters fight or argue and they brought those moments fantastically and with humor. Mary Holland another of Harper's sisters and also co-wrote this screenplay, portrays the invisible sister. My heart goes to her, when there is more than one child and depending on their goals or capacities sometimes there is one that feels left out. She portrayed her so lovingly and when it was time for her to feel noticed my heart sank. Aubrey Plaza is another great representation of Harper's ex-girlfriend. She portrays the feeling of rejection and loved the way she talked to Abby, she really shined in every scene. Dan Levy the best friend of Abby was wonderful and his scenes of tracking and the fish were hilarious. I loved how attentive he was with Abby and how he explained to her about understanding the situation of others.\n\nDear Clea DuVall once again thank you for creating and sharing this film, this representation was a breathtaking masterpiece. There is no other film that could even compare to, there were so many brilliant small details, also it was fresh, and bold in every way. This film means so much to me and I'm also glad that it was a Christmas theme film being as it is my favorite holiday and I added this film to my traditional Christmas movie list.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30761,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-11-25","keywords":"christmas,queer,lesbian relationship,coming out,lesbian","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi182305049","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQyYjBkZjgtNjcyMy00ODc3LWI2MmMtYmE0MTJmZjE5NTYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQyYjBkZjgtNjcyMy00ODc3LWI2MmMtYmE0MTJmZjE5NTYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"This holiday, everyone's secrets are coming out.

He became a hit actor in the likes of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (a personal childhood favourite), The Mask and Dumb and Dumber. He tried hard for an Oscar nom, but always contended with winning Golden Globes. And for years now, he has basically been bouncing around dramas, comedies, and dramedies. So now, he has tackled a remake (of a comedy no less), and the results as per the last few years, are mixed at best.\n\nCarrey is Dick, an employee at Globodyne (read: Enron) who is promoted just in time to help sail the company into oblivion on television. He tells his wife Jane (Tea Leoni) to leave her job only hours before hand, and upon returning stunning home, realizes that he may be in a bit of trouble. As the months go on, the pair's assets slowly begin to dwindle, and hope for continued survival begins to evaporate. So with nothing left to do, they turn to life of petty crime and hope for the best.\n\nIt is not an original concept at all, but Carrey and Leoni do a valiant job keeping this boat floating. While the film does have a few hilarious moments, the rest of it is bogged down by mere snicker-filled sequences or just scenes that are totally unfunny. It's not like these two actors are having any trouble being funny, it's that the material is not funny. Judd Apatow did wonders with The 40-Year-Old Virgin, but he fumbles here pretty hard with his writing partner Nicholas Stoller, who does not have nearly enough credits to his name. A parody on what happened at Enron was inevitable, but this just seems lackluster and barely thought out. Subplots are brought in, but barely resolved, and the key storyline just feels very weak by the end. It's not terrible, it just feels a tad bit incomplete.\n\nThe sorry thing about the entire film is the fact that much of it just feels like an extended montage with little payoff. It is only ninety minutes long, so it feels like a lot was trimmed down or cut right out. But the film suffers as a result. If it was longer, it undoubtedly could have had more potential for more funny moments, and as a whole, feel more complete.\n\nWhile Carrey and Leoni do their best, it's Leoni who gives a stronger performance. Yes, Carrey is right at home with his zany character, and totally overshadows Leoni in every single aspect. But he just lacks that integral element of human comedy here, that made him so famous in the first place. It's unfortunate, and makes me wonder if the old Carrey will ever return, or if we'll have to contend with semi-funny Carrey for the rest of his career. Leoni is much better, and feels more in tune with what she's doing. \n\nEven more unfortunate is the wasted supporting cast does very little. Alec Baldwin as the sleazy CEO Jack McCallister is sparingly unfunny, as is Richard Jenkins as the right hand man Frank Bascombe, who spends most of the movie drunk and not doing anything (besides setting up for the finale). The rest of the cast has little to no screen time, or are simply silly supporting characters that just feel like excess waste in the entire scheme of things.\n\nFor all of it's faults, the film is a worth while watch. As said, I did laugh at some of it. A bit of work on the screenplay would have benefited everyone here. Just do not go in expecting a comedy classic with Jim Carrey. If so, you will be sadly disappointed.\n\n6.5/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138632,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Judd Apatow did wonders with The 40-Year-Old Virgin, but he fumbles here pretty hard with his writing partner Nicholas Stoller, who does not have nearly enough credits to his name. A parody on what happened at Enron was inevitable, but this just seems lackluster and barely thought out. Subplots are brought in, but barely resolved, and the key storyline just feels very weak by the end. It's not terrible, it just feels a tad bit incomplete.\n\nThe sorry thing about the entire film is the fact that much of it just feels like an extended montage with little payoff. It is only ninety minutes long, so it feels like a lot was trimmed down or cut right out. But the film suffers as a result. If it was longer, it undoubtedly could have had more potential for more funny moments, and as a whole, feel more complete.\n\nWhile Carrey and Leoni do their best, it's Leoni who gives a stronger performance. Yes, Carrey is right at home with his zany character, and totally overshadows Leoni in every single aspect. But he just lacks that integral element of human comedy here, that made him so famous in the first place. It's unfortunate, and makes me wonder if the old Carrey will ever return, or if we'll have to contend with semi-funny Carrey for the rest of his career. Leoni is much better, and feels more in tune with what she's doing. \n\nEven more unfortunate is the wasted supporting cast does very little. Alec Baldwin as the sleazy CEO Jack McCallister is sparingly unfunny, as is Richard Jenkins as the right hand man Frank Bascombe, who spends most of the movie drunk and not doing anything (besides setting up for the finale). The rest of the cast has little to no screen time, or are simply silly supporting characters that just feel like excess waste in the entire scheme of things.\n\nFor all of it's faults, the film is a worth while watch. As said, I did laugh at some of it. A bit of work on the screenplay would have benefited everyone here. Just do not go in expecting a comedy classic with Jim Carrey. If so, you will be sadly disappointed.\n\n6.5/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138632,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For the most part it's a miss, we RARELY have a funny or original romantic comedy. It's been over a year since we've had a good romantic comedy and this year seems to be pushing the horrible movies of this genre. For example, we had The Proposal that was released this year and it was just awful and so simple. The Ugly Truth seemed to be heading the same way when I first saw the trailer, but when I learned that it was Rated R, I decided to try to give it a chance. Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I had expected, it actually had some really great laughs and is a heck a lot better than The Proposal. But once again The Ugly Truth fell back into the ugly formula of clichés that are just annoying and there were quite a few things that I would have done differently with the story, I'll first explain the plot.\n\nAbby, a TV producer, is coming home from another disastrous date one night, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, "The Ugly Truth," run by Mike Chadway, whose cynicism of relationships prompts Abby to call into the show to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers that the station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings, and the station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show to bring them back up. At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds Abby to be a control freak. However she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin living next to her, and Mike persuades her to follow his lead. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to quit; he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. But being a romantic comedy, Abby and Mike instead fall for each other as usual, you know how the story goes.\n\nNow things I would've done different, if you don't want spoilers then don't read on: there is a child that comes into Mike's apartment, he and Mike get along great, I'm thinking that's his son; instead it's his nephew. I think this would have added substance to his character and made him more likable and would have had a better story on why he was so bitter on women, maybe like the mother left him or something. Second: I honestly would have had Abby chosen the doctor over Mike. Katherine and Gerad are great on screen together, but their chemistry for this film I felt was more of a great friendship than falling in love with each other. Her choosing Mike over the doctor was so typical, I would have had the doctor find out about what was going on and then take her back realizing that he still liked her very much and then Mike ends up with some slutty girl as usual happy with his shallow life, but still enjoying it. Third: no tired formulas, no girl best friend supporting everything the lead female does, no big kiss in front of an audience, no dramatic of finding out what a kiss meant. Fourth: why do we have gorgeous people claiming they have a hard time finding love or supposedly not having sex for a year? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm finding it hard to believe that girls who look like Katherine Heigl are having the hardest time finding love.\n\nBut there are some positives in the film, honestly I did have a good time watching this film over all, it was just the ending that killed the movie. But even the little rip off of When Harry Met Sally where Abby is wearing vibrating panties at a company dinner and someone saying what was in her food to have the same effect, it's an old joke but it never gets old. I loved that this was a Rated R rom-com because the reason MOST of these movies don't work are due to the fact that they're too family friendly and very much unrealistic. Not to say that The Ugly Truth is completely realistic, but more so than most films. We have some sick jokes but get a great laugh, Abby is going to a baseball game with Colin, her crush, and she accidentally spills her drink on his lap and starts rubbing his pants to clean them and the kiss cam lowers in on them with a bad angle looking like she's just having fun with his hot dog. Honestly I think most of the theater had a hard time catching their breath on that joke, no one could stop laughing. Katherine and Gerad do have great chemistry on screen, I just think it would have worked better as a friendship. So I would say this is better suited as a rental vs. a theater view. It's a lot better than I expected but had more potential as it falls back into the same old tired formula.\n\n6/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":207931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For the most part it's a miss, we RARELY have a funny or original romantic comedy. It's been over a year since we've had a good romantic comedy and this year seems to be pushing the horrible movies of this genre. For example, we had The Proposal that was released this year and it was just awful and so simple. The Ugly Truth seemed to be heading the same way when I first saw the trailer, but when I learned that it was Rated R, I decided to try to give it a chance. Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I had expected, it actually had some really great laughs and is a heck a lot better than The Proposal. But once again The Ugly Truth fell back into the ugly formula of clichés that are just annoying and there were quite a few things that I would have done differently with the story, I'll first explain the plot.\n\nAbby, a TV producer, is coming home from another disastrous date one night, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, "The Ugly Truth," run by Mike Chadway, whose cynicism of relationships prompts Abby to call into the show to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers that the station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings, and the station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show to bring them back up. At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds Abby to be a control freak. However she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin living next to her, and Mike persuades her to follow his lead. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to quit; he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. But being a romantic comedy, Abby and Mike instead fall for each other as usual, you know how the story goes.\n\nNow things I would've done different, if you don't want spoilers then don't read on: there is a child that comes into Mike's apartment, he and Mike get along great, I'm thinking that's his son; instead it's his nephew. I think this would have added substance to his character and made him more likable and would have had a better story on why he was so bitter on women, maybe like the mother left him or something. Second: I honestly would have had Abby chosen the doctor over Mike. Katherine and Gerad are great on screen together, but their chemistry for this film I felt was more of a great friendship than falling in love with each other. Her choosing Mike over the doctor was so typical, I would have had the doctor find out about what was going on and then take her back realizing that he still liked her very much and then Mike ends up with some slutty girl as usual happy with his shallow life, but still enjoying it. Third: no tired formulas, no girl best friend supporting everything the lead female does, no big kiss in front of an audience, no dramatic of finding out what a kiss meant. Fourth: why do we have gorgeous people claiming they have a hard time finding love or supposedly not having sex for a year? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm finding it hard to believe that girls who look like Katherine Heigl are having the hardest time finding love.\n\nBut there are some positives in the film, honestly I did have a good time watching this film over all, it was just the ending that killed the movie. But even the little rip off of When Harry Met Sally where Abby is wearing vibrating panties at a company dinner and someone saying what was in her food to have the same effect, it's an old joke but it never gets old. I loved that this was a Rated R rom-com because the reason MOST of these movies don't work are due to the fact that they're too family friendly and very much unrealistic. Not to say that The Ugly Truth is completely realistic, but more so than most films. We have some sick jokes but get a great laugh, Abby is going to a baseball game with Colin, her crush, and she accidentally spills her drink on his lap and starts rubbing his pants to clean them and the kiss cam lowers in on them with a bad angle looking like she's just having fun with his hot dog.

The plot is rich but it only skims the surface of the problems but does not address any of it. It has some clever moments, wits, and twists. But, as a whole, it is forgettable, you wont remember or care to remember a thing after finishing the movie. The humor, in general, is too broad and feels flat. Steve Carell delivers a steadily funny and wholesome performance, while the underutilized Rose Byrne portrays the evil and seductive strategist perfectly.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14057,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For the most part it's a miss, we RARELY have a funny or original romantic comedy. It's been over a year since we've had a good romantic comedy and this year seems to be pushing the horrible movies of this genre. For example, we had The Proposal that was released this year and it was just awful and so simple. The Ugly Truth seemed to be heading the same way when I first saw the trailer, but when I learned that it was Rated R, I decided to try to give it a chance. Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I had expected, it actually had some really great laughs and is a heck a lot better than The Proposal. But once again The Ugly Truth fell back into the ugly formula of clichés that are just annoying and there were quite a few things that I would have done differently with the story, I'll first explain the plot.\n\nAbby, a TV producer, is coming home from another disastrous date one night, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, "The Ugly Truth," run by Mike Chadway, whose cynicism of relationships prompts Abby to call into the show to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers that the station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings, and the station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show to bring them back up. At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds Abby to be a control freak. However she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin living next to her, and Mike persuades her to follow his lead. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to quit; he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. But being a romantic comedy, Abby and Mike instead fall for each other as usual, you know how the story goes.\n\nNow things I would've done different, if you don't want spoilers then don't read on: there is a child that comes into Mike's apartment, he and Mike get along great, I'm thinking that's his son; instead it's his nephew. I think this would have added substance to his character and made him more likable and would have had a better story on why he was so bitter on women, maybe like the mother left him or something. Second: I honestly would have had Abby chosen the doctor over Mike. Katherine and Gerad are great on screen together, but their chemistry for this film I felt was more of a great friendship than falling in love with each other. Her choosing Mike over the doctor was so typical, I would have had the doctor find out about what was going on and then take her back realizing that he still liked her very much and then Mike ends up with some slutty girl as usual happy with his shallow life, but still enjoying it. Third: no tired formulas, no girl best friend supporting everything the lead female does, no big kiss in front of an audience, no dramatic of finding out what a kiss meant. Fourth: why do we have gorgeous people claiming they have a hard time finding love or supposedly not having sex for a year? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm finding it hard to believe that girls who look like Katherine Heigl are having the hardest time finding love.\n\nBut there are some positives in the film, honestly I did have a good time watching this film over all, it was just the ending that killed the movie. But even the little rip off of When Harry Met Sally where Abby is wearing vibrating panties at a company dinner and someone saying what was in her food to have the same effect, it's an old joke but it never gets old. I loved that this was a Rated R rom-com because the reason MOST of these movies don't work are due to the fact that they're too family friendly and very much unrealistic. Not to say that The Ugly Truth is completely realistic, but more so than most films. We have some sick jokes but get a great laugh, Abby is going to a baseball game with Colin, her crush, and she accidentally spills her drink on his lap and starts rubbing his pants to clean them and the kiss cam lowers in on them with a bad angle looking like she's just having fun with his hot dog. Honestly I think most of the theater had a hard time catching their breath on that joke, no one could stop laughing. Katherine and Gerad do have great chemistry on screen, I just think it would have worked better as a friendship. So I would say this is better suited as a rental vs. a theater view. It's a lot better than I expected but had more potential as it falls back into the same old tired formula.\n\n6/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":207931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For the most part it's a miss, we RARELY have a funny or original romantic comedy. It's been over a year since we've had a good romantic comedy and this year seems to be pushing the horrible movies of this genre. For example, we had The Proposal that was released this year and it was just awful and so simple. The Ugly Truth seemed to be heading the same way when I first saw the trailer, but when I learned that it was Rated R, I decided to try to give it a chance. Honestly, this movie was a lot better than I had expected, it actually had some really great laughs and is a heck a lot better than The Proposal. But once again The Ugly Truth fell back into the ugly formula of clichés that are just annoying and there were quite a few things that I would have done differently with the story, I'll first explain the plot.\n\nAbby, a TV producer, is coming home from another disastrous date one night, she happens to see a segment of a local television show, "The Ugly Truth," run by Mike Chadway, whose cynicism of relationships prompts Abby to call into the show to argue with him on-air. The next day, she discovers that the station is threatening to cancel her show because of its poor ratings, and the station owner has hired Mike to do a segment on her show to bring them back up. At first, the two have a rocky relationship; Abby thinks Mike is crass and disgusting while Mike finds Abby to be a control freak. However she meets the man of her dreams, a doctor named Colin living next to her, and Mike persuades her to follow his lead. She agrees to his helpful advice and if he can get her the man she wants, proving his theories on relationships, she will work happily with him, but if Mike fails, he agrees to quit; he successfully guides Abby to be exactly what Colin would want. But being a romantic comedy, Abby and Mike instead fall for each other as usual, you know how the story goes.\n\nNow things I would've done different, if you don't want spoilers then don't read on: there is a child that comes into Mike's apartment, he and Mike get along great, I'm thinking that's his son; instead it's his nephew. I think this would have added substance to his character and made him more likable and would have had a better story on why he was so bitter on women, maybe like the mother left him or something. Second: I honestly would have had Abby chosen the doctor over Mike. Katherine and Gerad are great on screen together, but their chemistry for this film I felt was more of a great friendship than falling in love with each other. Her choosing Mike over the doctor was so typical, I would have had the doctor find out about what was going on and then take her back realizing that he still liked her very much and then Mike ends up with some slutty girl as usual happy with his shallow life, but still enjoying it. Third: no tired formulas, no girl best friend supporting everything the lead female does, no big kiss in front of an audience, no dramatic of finding out what a kiss meant. Fourth: why do we have gorgeous people claiming they have a hard time finding love or supposedly not having sex for a year? I'm not saying it's impossible, but I'm finding it hard to believe that girls who look like Katherine Heigl are having the hardest time finding love.\n\nBut there are some positives in the film, honestly I did have a good time watching this film over all, it was just the ending that killed the movie. But even the little rip off of When Harry Met Sally where Abby is wearing vibrating panties at a company dinner and someone saying what was in her food to have the same effect, it's an old joke but it never gets old. I loved that this was a Rated R rom-com because the reason MOST of these movies don't work are due to the fact that they're too family friendly and very much unrealistic. Not to say that The Ugly Truth is completely realistic, but more so than most films. We have some sick jokes but get a great laugh, Abby is going to a baseball game with Colin, her crush, and she accidentally spills her drink on his lap and starts rubbing his pants to clean them and the kiss cam lowers in on them with a bad angle looking like she's just having fun with his hot dog.

I liked it.","reviewBody":"STARSKY &amp; HUTCH\n\nI had seen this film for sale in my local DVD shop so cheap that I had to buy it. Everyone I had spoken to that had seen it had told me that this film was terrible. Every review I had read about it says it is really bad  but my attitude towards it was "How bad can it be?". The truth is  I actually quite enjoyed it.\n\nThe movie is based on an old TV show of the same name. 2 police officers are forced to work with each other, but they are both completely different to each other. They are trying to hunt down a drug dealer that has some cocaine in his possession that is completely undetectable. Not even the police dogs can smell it.\n\nThe comedy in this movie is not great. I laughed out loud once throughout the entire movie. But that is not to say it was not funny. There were a few moments in the film that made me smile and I thought were entertaining. I do wish it was funnier though. The story was quite good, but nothing we have not seen a million times before in buddy cop movies.\n\nThe action as really good in places. The car chases were really good and the stunts reminded me of watching the classic TV shows that I loved as a kid, Knight Rider and the Dukes of Hazzard. It was great to see the old red Gran Torino with the white stripe along the side. I love that car  I don't really remember it from TV as I never watched the show, but I know the car. During the credits at the end, you can see some of the car stunts that go wrong during filming. These are awesome, but it is a shame to see the lovely cars getting smashed up.\n\nI like the actors in this movie. The film stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. These guys are funny guys, but sometimes it just doesn't work.

I liked it.","reviewBody":"STARSKY &amp; HUTCH\n\nI had seen this film for sale in my local DVD shop so cheap that I had to buy it. Everyone I had spoken to that had seen it had told me that this film was terrible. Every review I had read about it says it is really bad  but my attitude towards it was "How bad can it be?". The truth is  I actually quite enjoyed it.\n\nThe movie is based on an old TV show of the same name. 2 police officers are forced to work with each other, but they are both completely different to each other. They are trying to hunt down a drug dealer that has some cocaine in his possession that is completely undetectable. Not even the police dogs can smell it.\n\nThe comedy in this movie is not great. I laughed out loud once throughout the entire movie. But that is not to say it was not funny. There were a few moments in the film that made me smile and I thought were entertaining. I do wish it was funnier though. The story was quite good, but nothing we have not seen a million times before in buddy cop movies.\n\nThe action as really good in places. The car chases were really good and the stunts reminded me of watching the classic TV shows that I loved as a kid, Knight Rider and the Dukes of Hazzard. It was great to see the old red Gran Torino with the white stripe along the side. I love that car  I don't really remember it from TV as I never watched the show, but I know the car. During the credits at the end, you can see some of the car stunts that go wrong during filming. These are awesome, but it is a shame to see the lovely cars getting smashed up.\n\nI like the actors in this movie. The film stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. These guys are funny guys, but sometimes it just doesn't work. I thought Ben played his part well and Owen played his part well too, but for some reason the chemistry between them both felt like something was missing. I could not imagine them as partners and even after watching them for 90 minutes, I still didn't really see them as partners. But nonetheless, they both did well and I enjoyed watching them. There were a lot of other famous faces in this film that I didn't know were in it  Snoop Dogg, Fred Williamson, Vince Vaughn, Juliette Lewis, Jason Bateman, Amy Smart, Carmen Electra and Chris Penn. Also I loved the cameo at the end from the original Starsky &amp; Hutch, David Soul &amp; Paul Michael Glaser from the TV show.

It did not deserve the bashing by all the reviewers that it took.\n\nI will give this film 7 out of 10.\n\n"A floater. Nothing harder to solve than a floater.

The truth is  I actually quite enjoyed it.\n\nThe movie is based on an old TV show of the same name. 2 police officers are forced to work with each other, but they are both completely different to each other. They are trying to hunt down a drug dealer that has some cocaine in his possession that is completely undetectable. Not even the police dogs can smell it.\n\nThe comedy in this movie is not great. I laughed out loud once throughout the entire movie. But that is not to say it was not funny. There were a few moments in the film that made me smile and I thought were entertaining. I do wish it was funnier though. The story was quite good, but nothing we have not seen a million times before in buddy cop movies.\n\nThe action as really good in places. The car chases were really good and the stunts reminded me of watching the classic TV shows that I loved as a kid, Knight Rider and the Dukes of Hazzard.

During the credits at the end, you can see some of the car stunts that go wrong during filming.

I thought Ben played his part well and Owen played his part well too, but for some reason the chemistry between them both felt like something was missing. I could not imagine them as partners and even after watching them for 90 minutes, I still didn't really see them as partners. But nonetheless, they both did well and I enjoyed watching them.

It's not meant to be. It's meant to be entertaining and that's exactly what it is.","reviewBody":"When the credits started, I had a big smile on my face.\n\nWhat is your perception of 2 Guns? Whether you've seen the trailer or read the comic, you might have an idea what sort of movie this is. If so, you will be correct and happy you decided to watch it.\n\nThe big surprise many seem to have is the fact that this movie is based on the 2 GUNS comic Boom! Studios put out in 2007. I'll admit, despite the fact that I've always read a lot of Boom's comics, this series somehow completely snuck by. I did read the series before watching the movie. Whether or not you should do that, we'll get to that in minute.\n\nThe movie stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. That in itself is pretty impressive. These two actors crank up the charisma during the movie. You can't help but enjoy their presence on screen.\n\nThese two guys are planning on robbing a bank. It turns out it wasn't a simple bank and they ended up with way more than they thought. The twists and turns avalanche upon them as they discover others that are interested in the money plus the fact that they don't know each other as well as they thought. If you've watched the trailer, you probably know more about the movie than you should.\n\nWashington and Wahlberg are great together. For a movie with a lot of shooting and one- liners, it's the kind you can just become immersed in. This is pure entertainment. Parts may get a little outrageous and a tad predictable. But there are still plenty of twists to catch you off guard. You'll laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat and you'll even find yourself flinching or cringing a little at times.\n\nShould you or should you not read the comic first?\n\nThat really depends on how much you want to know ahead of time.

Whether you've seen the trailer or read the comic, you might have an idea what sort of movie this is. If so, you will be correct and happy you decided to watch it.\n\nThe big surprise many seem to have is the fact that this movie is based on the 2 GUNS comic Boom! Studios put out in 2007. I'll admit, despite the fact that I've always read a lot of Boom's comics, this series somehow completely snuck by. I did read the series before watching the movie. Whether or not you should do that, we'll get to that in minute.\n\nThe movie stars Denzel Washington and Mark Wahlberg. That in itself is pretty impressive. These two actors crank up the charisma during the movie. You can't help but enjoy their presence on screen.\n\nThese two guys are planning on robbing a bank. It turns out it wasn't a simple bank and they ended up with way more than they thought. The twists and turns avalanche upon them as they discover others that are interested in the money plus the fact that they don't know each other as well as they thought. If you've watched the trailer, you probably know more about the movie than you should.\n\nWashington and Wahlberg are great together. For a movie with a lot of shooting and one- liners, it's the kind you can just become immersed in. This is pure entertainment. Parts may get a little outrageous and a tad predictable. But there are still plenty of twists to catch you off guard. You'll laugh, you'll be on the edge of your seat and you'll even find yourself flinching or cringing a little at times.\n\nShould you or should you not read the comic first?\n\nThat really depends on how much you want to know ahead of time. Some of the twists weren't revealed in the trailers. The movie is pretty faithful to the comic, something pretty rare for a "comic book movie." There are obviously some minor differences but if you have read it before, you'll smile hearing some lines taken directly from the comic. Washington's casting is a bit of a departure.

The thought of seeing another actor attempting the stilted period lingo and mello-drama gives me a headache, BUT Miss Coppola has undone my pain with this fresh take on the period drama, with her lovely and off-beat MARIE-ANTOINETTE. Usually you watch the piece from afar, thinking, "Wow, life sure was hard back then," but you never really can relate to the characters, but Coppola breaks tradition in a completely refreshing way, so that you can really understand these characters. She uses modern day music (not like the horrible A KNIGHT'S TALE did) and hand held camera work. Her style is much more free and alive. She takes her time with the material so that we get a feel for time period and all of the free time they had. The acting is first rate, other than a mis-cast Rip Torn who's a little too over-the-top. If you've enjoyed her other movies (THE VIRGIN SUICIDES &amp; LOST IN TRANSLATION), then you are sure to enjoy this film. But if you are looking for another stilted period drama with forced accents and dead camera work then rent THE PARTRIOT or VANITY FAIR. I really enjoyed MARIE-ANTIONETTE, though I'm not sure how historically accurate it is, it's a fine film. Some have criticized Coppola for making a French subject so American, but that is not the point, she has created an accessible historical biopic, that people of MARIE-ANTIONETTE's age could enjoy and relate to.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":105682,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2006-05-24","keywords":"female rear nudity,nudity,public nudity,cleavage,phimosis","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Marie Antoinette","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1939341593","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEwN2I4MzItMDdhMy00YzEwLWExZmUtMGM2YTlmMGMzYWE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEwN2I4MzItMDdhMy00YzEwLWExZmUtMGM2YTlmMGMzYWE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005403/","name":"Jason Schwartzman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001800/","name":"Rip Torn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001068/","name":"Sofia Coppola"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035638/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032110/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001068/","name":"Sofia Coppola"}],"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The thought of seeing another actor attempting the stilted period lingo and mello-drama gives me a headache, BUT Miss Coppola has undone my pain with this fresh take on the period drama, with her lovely and off-beat MARIE-ANTOINETTE. Usually you watch the piece from afar, thinking, "Wow, life sure was hard back then," but you never really can relate to the characters, but Coppola breaks tradition in a completely refreshing way, so that you can really understand these characters. She uses modern day music (not like the horrible A KNIGHT'S TALE did) and hand held camera work. Her style is much more free and alive. She takes her time with the material so that we get a feel for time period and all of the free time they had. The acting is first rate, other than a mis-cast Rip Torn who's a little too over-the-top. If you've enjoyed her other movies (THE VIRGIN SUICIDES &amp; LOST IN TRANSLATION), then you are sure to enjoy this film. But if you are looking for another stilted period drama with forced accents and dead camera work then rent THE PARTRIOT or VANITY FAIR. I really enjoyed MARIE-ANTIONETTE, though I'm not sure how historically accurate it is, it's a fine film. Some have criticized Coppola for making a French subject so American, but that is not the point, she has created an accessible historical biopic, that people of MARIE-ANTIONETTE's age could enjoy and relate to.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":105682,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2006-05-24","keywords":"female rear nudity,nudity,public nudity,cleavage,phimosis","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Marie Antoinette","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1939341593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEwN2I4MzItMDdhMy00YzEwLWExZmUtMGM2YTlmMGMzYWE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzEwN2I4MzItMDdhMy00YzEwLWExZmUtMGM2YTlmMGMzYWE1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000379/","name":"Kirsten Dunst","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005403/","name":"Jason Schwartzman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001800/","name":"Rip Torn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001068/","name":"Sofia Coppola"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035638/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032110/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001068/","name":"Sofia Coppola"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I read the book and found it OK, but not like fantastic (almost like the Alchymist by Coehlo; sort of simple enough for anyone to understand, but deep enough for a lot of people to feel intellectual or in touch with new thoughts). But for the movie I had low expectations, based on the reviews - nonetheless I was positively surprised, though left wondering if most critics are just a bunch of sheep following a path (made by an old sheep who left decades ago)? And hence, obliged to hate any woman prioritizing herself?\n\nThe movie deals with a topic that very few (American) movies actually deal with - our inner lives and pursuits for balance and happiness. Maybe because it is difficult, as it is a somewhat stand still, internal journey. But EPL has made it possible by wrapping it into an external journey too. \n\nBut my main point adding to the other reviews: Some of the criticism of the movie is that the main character doesn't seem to have a good reason to be unhappy, and to leave her husband. However, what is dealt with in the book, but not comes across in the movie, is that she and her husband are to trying to have a baby, as is expected by "people" (and by her husband). EG discovers in this process that she is still not ready for children, in fact she never will be. She doesn't feel cut for it at all, and if she has a child, she feel she'll lose herself (her new husband got himself fixed before he met her, so there was never a question about it). To choose away what many women view as a deed to validate their existence; having children, is tough and scary. One will be judged. Also, she knew her husband's expectation of building a family was not unreasonable, making her feel ashamed and different. This is one of the key reasons for her to start praying; to be able to follow her own instincts, breaking the conventional norms. By excluding from the script this realization for the main character, the viewer is left puzzled with what is wrong in this marriage, there is something that doesn't make sense here. Too bad, leaving this issue out, as it would've added another dimension to the movie and increase the viewers understanding of why EG and her husband should split.\n\nI can't help wonder why they chose to eliminate it from the story, whether it is because it would not appeal to conservative American women who after all are the majority of the box office customers for this movie? Or whether the movie creator thought it wouldn't make a difference? After all it made the whole lot of difference to the marriage, and was a impetus for her entire journey.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":91310,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"duration":"PT2H13M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But for the movie I had low expectations, based on the reviews - nonetheless I was positively surprised, though left wondering if most critics are just a bunch of sheep following a path (made by an old sheep who left decades ago)? And hence, obliged to hate any woman prioritizing herself?\n\nThe movie deals with a topic that very few (American) movies actually deal with - our inner lives and pursuits for balance and happiness. Maybe because it is difficult, as it is a somewhat stand still, internal journey. But EPL has made it possible by wrapping it into an external journey too. \n\nBut my main point adding to the other reviews: Some of the criticism of the movie is that the main character doesn't seem to have a good reason to be unhappy, and to leave her husband. However, what is dealt with in the book, but not comes across in the movie, is that she and her husband are to trying to have a baby, as is expected by "people" (and by her husband). EG discovers in this process that she is still not ready for children, in fact she never will be. She doesn't feel cut for it at all, and if she has a child, she feel she'll lose herself (her new husband got himself fixed before he met her, so there was never a question about it). To choose away what many women view as a deed to validate their existence; having children, is tough and scary. One will be judged. Also, she knew her husband's expectation of building a family was not unreasonable, making her feel ashamed and different. This is one of the key reasons for her to start praying; to be able to follow her own instincts, breaking the conventional norms. By excluding from the script this realization for the main character, the viewer is left puzzled with what is wrong in this marriage, there is something that doesn't make sense here. Too bad, leaving this issue out, as it would've added another dimension to the movie and increase the viewers understanding of why EG and her husband should split.\n\nI can't help wonder why they chose to eliminate it from the story, whether it is because it would not appeal to conservative American women who after all are the majority of the box office customers for this movie? Or whether the movie creator thought it wouldn't make a difference? After all it made the whole lot of difference to the marriage, and was a impetus for her entire journey.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":91310,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"duration":"PT2H13M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The real lynchpin of the whole endeavour is Ethan Hawke's battered Brown who oscillates wildly between devout believer and violent zealot never quite settling into anything categorizable but is a bewitching screen presence (despite portraits of Brown clearly pointing at Willem Defoe as the obvious choice - a casting bugbear that may bother me forever).\n\nThe cast are uniformly impressive, from personal favourites like Beau Knapp, Wyatt Russell and Steve Zahn to revelatory turns by a rather pompous Daveed Diggs and the arrestingly bemused Joshua Caleb Johnson who shines throughout.

If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...\n\nThe A-Team.\n\nWith a script any eight year old would love, the four members of the A-Team went off every week to somewhere in America to help someone who couldn't find help anywhere else.

He's a surgeon from sophisticated, worldly London who moves to (fictional) Portwenn on the coast of Cornwall because he suddenly becomes ill at the sight of blood. This is not a good omen for a surgeon. He quits to become a general practitioner and he's satisfied, thanks very much, with checkups, prescriptions and referrals.\n\nThe foul-mannered, blunt-spoken Doc smugly considers himself above the crowd, but he soon learns he is really BELOW the crowd, out of step with Portwenn's eccentricities, value systems and peculiar burghers, who make the mere lunatics of London look normal by comparison.\n\nMartin Clunes is terrific in the lead role. He is a tall, charismatic and not exactly handsome actor who looks like he would be more comfortable playing cops and heavies. He is, instead, a consummate comic actor. His facial and physical comedy, his frequent bouts of exasperation and bewilderment, are things to behold. (Note: some wags have compared him to 'House,' from the popular TV drama of the same name. House is played by Hugh Laurie, another splendid Brit, and that's about where the comparison begins and ends. They are two very different characters in two very different shows.)\n\nPortwenn's local population, with its twisted logic that somehow makes perfect sense, is represented through the tour-de-force acting of supporting players: Bert (Ian McNeice, who always dazzles playing offbeat, world-weary philosophical characters); Louise (the charming and beautiful Caroline Catz), who either loves Martin or wants to kill him; corn-rowed Elaine (lovely Lucy Punch) as the ditzy assistant with her own set of secretarial ethics; and Doc's Aunt Joan (the great Stephanie Cole, who has been delighting audiences since the 1960s).\n\nDominic Minghella, he of the Minghella mob of talented artists (brother Anthony directed 'The English Patient'), is the brains behind this brilliant controlled chaos.\n\nDon't miss this program. TV shows that are both funny AND intelligent are the rarest of TV fare.\n\nAnd a fast footnote: let us all bow our heads and pray that Hollywood doesn't try to remake this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I thought the introduction to Falling Skies was very clever and the production values looked good, so I was psyched to watch. I even called my husband in. We lasted about 40 minutes and couldn't stand it any more. Sappy, corny and derivative (did I say sappy?) beyond belief. What irks me the most is that they expect you to identify with the characters within the first 10 minutes without even getting to know them. Just because they play sweet music every time certain characters come on screen, we're supposed to wilt.\n\nI'm not going to waste more time on it, but I just had to try and balance the reviews so others wouldn't waste their time.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86879,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2011-06-19","keywords":"alien,military,father son relationship,alien invasion,supernatural power","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001864/","name":"Noah Wyle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2397366/","name":"Drew Roy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2684485/","name":"Maxim Knight"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003158/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088248/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305826/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Requiem","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi250064153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MTMyMjkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYxNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MTMyMjkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYxNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"See the first full trailer for the fourth season of TNT's "Falling Skies"."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Now I like it and find myself rootin' for the humans and wanting a piece of the skitters myself. Each episode is better than the last (so far) and the story line is progressing (slowly). To me, this show is like FireFly. Started of a little far-fetched, but like FireFly, is becoming a show I anticipated to see the next episode. Sadly, FireFly was canceled just as the story line was progressing and when it developed a good audience. Just hope this show develops in the same manner but not canceled. Curious, however, to how long the conflict will last, will the aliens and humans learn to coexist, will there be a victory and defeat of either side....and will there be some higher philosophical question for all of us to ask ourselves about life, existence, family and humanity. If that develops into the storyline....this will surely be a show with a following like FireFly and one worth watching again.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86697,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2011-06-19","keywords":"alien,military,father son relationship,alien invasion,supernatural power","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001864/","name":"Noah Wyle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2397366/","name":"Drew Roy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2684485/","name":"Maxim Knight"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003158/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088248/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0305826/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Requiem","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi250064153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MTMyMjkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYxNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MTMyMjkzNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjYxNTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"See the first full trailer for the fourth season of TNT's "Falling Skies"."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When Lilly was murdered, her father Sheriff Keith (Enrico Colantoni) arrested Lilly's powerful father, but later someone else confessed. They ran Keith out of office and Veronica became a pariah. Now she investigates the deep dark secrets of her school divided between the ultra-rich and the poor minorities.\n\nRob Thomas has created a high school Nancy Drew with an edge. She's as smart as Sherlock Holmes. Only she's a girl trying to survive the High School world. It works as both a murder mystery, and a high school teen drama. This is Kristen Bell's break out role. She really gives a funny spunky likable compelling performance. This is a teen drama for smart people.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69160,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-09-22","keywords":"female protagonist,internal monologue,murder of best friend,bus accident,female detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068338/","name":"Kristen Bell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230655/","name":"Jason Dohring","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170186/","name":"Enrico Colantoni"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020047/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017673/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175100/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859432/","name":"Rob Thomas"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1849539609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Y2U5NWEtMGVhZC00ZTM4LTgzNzUtYTgxM2I1MDY0NTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Y2U5NWEtMGVhZC00ZTM4LTgzNzUtYTgxM2I1MDY0NTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Spring breakers are getting murdered in Neptune, thereby decimating the seaside town's tourist industry.

"The Golden Army" is more fantastical than the first film and is less sci-fi oriented but this is the sort of thing Del Toro does exceptionally well as a writer.

I am convinced without a shadow of a doubt that Guillermo Del Toro's entire career has been leading up to this film, particularly regarding his work as screenwriter here. The comedy feels less forced and is worked incredibly well into the script here, so much so that it doesn't feel remotely unnatural when the scene of comic drunken singing leads directly without a break into one of the film's most intensely dramatic sequences. Del Toro's handling of character has never been better, not even with "The Devil's Backbone", which is still my favorite of his films, and his sheer skill and ability when it comes to telling a fairytale-esquire fantasy is astonishing, as proved in the prologue to this film. In short this is Del Toro at the top of his game and providing artistry the likes of which we rarely if ever see in summer blockbusters. It's only fair that an astonishingly brilliant comic like "Hellboy" by an astonishingly brilliant artist like Mike Mignola is adapted this well and by someone as talented at what they do as he is.\n\nHow refreshing it is, a week after the release of "Hancock", which to me epitomizes everything wrong with action film-making today, that we get "The Golden Army" which features hands down some of the finest action scenes we have ever seen in this sort of film.
