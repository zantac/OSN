In my opinion, CSI: Miami is superior to the original and a good foundation for (the also superior) CSI:NY.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the original is the original, but the fact that the real Miami/Dade CSI's are cops first allows this show to explode in gunfire at any moment...and place our lead, David Caruso, at the center of the action. Now I want to make something clear: Almost 15 years ago I saw some of Caruso's early work and I was trying to figure out what all the fuss was about. What makes THIS guy a sex symbol (on NYPD Blue)? Then, just as fast as he becomes a major star, he exits Blue, makes two movies that bombed (the really good "Kiss Of Death" and the laughable "Jade") and he's suddenly poison. It was after seeing Caruso in Kiss of Death and a previous film, The King of New York" that I realized we were missing one of the last REAL tough guys.\n\nCSI: Miami has brought him back. Caruso spearheads this show with a vengeance. Sure his line readings have their own stilted rhythm, but he did the same thing on NYPD Blue and people loved him then. Caruso with a gun in his hand looks more natural than anything else I have seen on TV (and my favorite show is The Shield).\n\nCSI: Miami is action packed. The stories are seedier. The cinematography is unmatched by any other show. Go watch the DVDs. Tune in Monday nights. I swear, you'll be a convert.\n\nThen go watch Gary Sinise give the performance of his life in CSI:NY. You'll be glad you did.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54815,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-09-23","keywords":"place name in title,city name in title,city in title,united states of america,usa","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000325/","name":"David Caruso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698346/","name":"Emily Procter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735226/","name":"Adam Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231929/","name":"Ann Donahue","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578856/","name":"Carol Mendelsohn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.\n\nThe thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.\n\nAlso all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).\n\nThe reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. \n\n9 out of 10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-09-20","keywords":"shared universe,ampersand in title,punctuation in title,sexually motivated,sexually motivated assault","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002127/","name":"Mariska Hargitay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005221/","name":"Christopher Meloni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001384/","name":"Ice-T"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069685/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080319/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3079995673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Jerry Orbach is great as Lennie, and I was stunned to learn that he also played the voice of Lumiere, the French candlestick in Beauty and the Beast! His sarcastic one-liners never fail to get me laughing, and he and his new partner, Jesse L. Martin as Ed Green, have a good rapport and are believable as partners. On the "Order" side, Sam Waterston, Dianne Wiest, and Elisabeth Rohm are equally compelling. New cast member Rohm has gotten better as she's gone along; she had big shoes to fill as Angie Harmon's replacement. Because the stories are all driven by the plots, and not the characters' personal lives, it makes the constant cast turnover more believable. It's a testament to Dick Wolf and co. that such a smart, sharp show has stayed on the edge after almost 12 years! My only beef is I'm tired of hearing "Ripped from the headlines" in every promo. That, though, is a minor quibble.

Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.\n\nThe thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.\n\nAlso all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).\n\nThe reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. \n\n9 out of 10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-09-20","keywords":"shared universe,ampersand in title,punctuation in title,sexually motivated,sexually motivated assault","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002127/","name":"Mariska Hargitay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005221/","name":"Christopher Meloni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001384/","name":"Ice-T"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069685/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080319/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3079995673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Jerry Orbach is great as Lennie, and I was stunned to learn that he also played the voice of Lumiere, the French candlestick in Beauty and the Beast! His sarcastic one-liners never fail to get me laughing, and he and his new partner, Jesse L. Martin as Ed Green, have a good rapport and are believable as partners. On the "Order" side, Sam Waterston, Dianne Wiest, and Elisabeth Rohm are equally compelling. New cast member Rohm has gotten better as she's gone along; she had big shoes to fill as Angie Harmon's replacement. Because the stories are all driven by the plots, and not the characters' personal lives, it makes the constant cast turnover more believable. It's a testament to Dick Wolf and co. that such a smart, sharp show has stayed on the edge after almost 12 years! My only beef is I'm tired of hearing "Ripped from the headlines" in every promo. That, though, is a minor quibble.

So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15651,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Jerry Orbach is great as Lennie, and I was stunned to learn that he also played the voice of Lumiere, the French candlestick in Beauty and the Beast! His sarcastic one-liners never fail to get me laughing, and he and his new partner, Jesse L. Martin as Ed Green, have a good rapport and are believable as partners. On the "Order" side, Sam Waterston, Dianne Wiest, and Elisabeth Rohm are equally compelling. New cast member Rohm has gotten better as she's gone along; she had big shoes to fill as Angie Harmon's replacement. Because the stories are all driven by the plots, and not the characters' personal lives, it makes the constant cast turnover more believable. It's a testament to Dick Wolf and co. that such a smart, sharp show has stayed on the edge after almost 12 years! My only beef is I'm tired of hearing "Ripped from the headlines" in every promo. That, though, is a minor quibble. Wednesday nights wouldn't be the same without it!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1990-09-13","keywords":"shared universe,copaganda,profanity,ampersand in title,punctuation in title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001583/","name":"Jerry Orbach","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0552509/","name":"Jesse L.

A little bit of psychological and sociological background being introduced to the general public to get a grasp on criminal profiling. The episodes were entertaining, the characters relatable yet realistically flawed. However from season 6 on, this series just spiraled downward. The cases lost the grip they had had on the audience, became dull and left you cold. In an attempt to make up for unimaginative cases and the routine that had set it when watching the team profile, gore and violence was increased and to even it out cheesy background plots for the characters were added. Sometimes it's just better to quit while you're ahead.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174251,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

A little bit of psychological and sociological background being introduced to the general public to get a grasp on criminal profiling. The episodes were entertaining, the characters relatable yet realistically flawed. However from season 6 on, this series just spiraled downward. The cases lost the grip they had had on the audience, became dull and left you cold. In an attempt to make up for unimaginative cases and the routine that had set it when watching the team profile, gore and violence was increased and to even it out cheesy background plots for the characters were added. Sometimes it's just better to quit while you're ahead.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174251,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

A little bit of psychological and sociological background being introduced to the general public to get a grasp on criminal profiling. The episodes were entertaining, the characters relatable yet realistically flawed. However from season 6 on, this series just spiraled downward. The cases lost the grip they had had on the audience, became dull and left you cold. In an attempt to make up for unimaginative cases and the routine that had set it when watching the team profile, gore and violence was increased and to even it out cheesy background plots for the characters were added. Sometimes it's just better to quit while you're ahead.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174251,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

A little bit of psychological and sociological background being introduced to the general public to get a grasp on criminal profiling. The episodes were entertaining, the characters relatable yet realistically flawed. However from season 6 on, this series just spiraled downward. The cases lost the grip they had had on the audience, became dull and left you cold. In an attempt to make up for unimaginative cases and the routine that had set it when watching the team profile, gore and violence was increased and to even it out cheesy background plots for the characters were added. Sometimes it's just better to quit while you're ahead.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174251,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

Now there are two sides to that coin. One is that the character is unique and interesting to watch from a medical point of view, and that's why the movie puts him there.

Before it was ever mentioned in the film I was 100% certain that was what I was looking at. He keeps it up for the entire movie and never drops a scene either. The other cast member who really impressed me was Ana de Armas. I came to learn of her acting talents in 'Knives Out' and she has impressed me again here. She didn't have anything overly special to do in the film, but you could still tell she was a class above the rest.\n\nThe film itself is a little obvious in what it is trying to set up and surprise the audience with. There's one scene in particular that they thought they were being subtle with, but in reality it put all the cards on the table and gave the game away. Also there is a mystery element of sorts to the film that, had it been handled differently, could have been really interesting. Instead it was just clunky and petered out to dust by the end. I think the thing to watch this film for is Sheridan's performance and as a character study of an Aspergers syndrome. Otherwise there isn't a whole lot going for it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Kopylov makes the battles feel grounded and realistic for the most part, and some soldiers suffer shell shock, PTSD, delirium and panic attacks, just as you would expect under those conditions. The violence is also fairly visceral and realistic; the special effects team make use of both squibbing and CGI, so while those of you who may hate the look of CGI blood, there is still some squibbing effects that help highlight the realism of the gun battles.\n\nOverall, it's a fascinating watch. Of course it's not as over-the-top and action-packed as T-34, but it is very similar to Kim Druzhinin and Andrey Shalopa's tightly hewn war-thriller, Panfilov's 28.

The movie is a slow burn which devotes the majority of its time to establishing the central 3 characters (impressive performances), who make up 3 generations of women from an old family in an old house in rural Victoria. If you enjoy thoughtful film-making with a "less is more" approach, you'll be rewarded by a masterfully disturbing and shocking third act climax with an emotional kick that will give you closure but leave you thinking. It should be noted though, just the like characters in Relic, you'll have to give attention to the people in front of you to reap the rewards.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie is a slow burn which devotes the majority of its time to establishing the central 3 characters (impressive performances), who make up 3 generations of women from an old family in an old house in rural Victoria. If you enjoy thoughtful film-making with a "less is more" approach, you'll be rewarded by a masterfully disturbing and shocking third act climax with an emotional kick that will give you closure but leave you thinking. It should be noted though, just the like characters in Relic, you'll have to give attention to the people in front of you to reap the rewards.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="fr">Princess Europe: Directed by Camille Lotteau. With Andrej Babis, Bernard-Henri Lévy, Emmanuel Macron, Viktor Orbán. During the 2019 European election campaign, Bernard-Henri Levy sets out to save Europe by travelling across the continent with a play written and performed by him. The film follows the relentless defender of the EU along the roads of some 20 intertwined countries, but also goes out of the theatres to meet situations and faces. The black and white aplomb of the character BHL underlines, in contrast, the colourful dress of Princess Europe, whose frail fabric is woven of unevenly distributed wealth, memories of war and promises of struggle. A mute migrant, the sweetness of Lisbon, the irruption of the Transcarpathian in the basement of an Ukrainian bar, a President who pretends that "populism is the people" or another one who mourns his country abandoned to free trade, Macron, Orban, Babis, well known and unknown people, are the characters of this story.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 12792500, Title: Princess Europe, 
 --- Description: Princess Europe: Directed by Camille Lotteau. With Andrej Babis, Bernard-Henri Lévy, Emmanuel Macron, Viktor Orbán. During the 2019 European election campaign, Bernard-Henri Levy sets out to save Europe by travelling across the continent with a play written and performed by him. The film follows the relentless defender of the EU along the roads of some 20 intertwined countries, but also goes out of the theatres to meet situations and faces. The black and white aplomb of the character BHL underlines, in contrast, the colourful dress of Princess Europe, whose frail fabric is woven of unevenly distributed wealth, memories of war and promises of struggle. A mute migrant, the sweetness of Lisbon, the irruption of the Transcarpathian in the basement of an Ukrainian bar, a President who pretends that "populism is the people" or another one who mourns his country abandoned to free trade, Macron, Orban, Babis, well known and unknown people, are the characters of this story. We push the muddy or golden doors of all houses; we roam a common space, we capture, or leave, the theatrical adventure; and we listen to the chorus of the multitude rising above the jousts of power." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt12792500/","name":"Princess Europe","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2ZkNWVjOTUtMzk5Mi00ZTZkLWFkMGEtNjg3ODUzMjkxYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzg5MzIyOA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"During the 2019 European election campaign, Bernard-Henri Levy sets out to save Europe by travelling across the continent with a play written and performed by him.

 --- Description: On fait comme on a dit: Directed by Philippe Bérenger. With Gad Elmaleh, Atmen Kelif, Yvan Le Bolloc'h, Gilbert Melki. One fine day, at about 10 am, in a suburban house, three men, in their thirties are waiting for a fourth buddy. When he arrives, they plan to hold up the local bank where Séverine, their accomplice, is waiting for them. This could well be the beginning of a thrilling crime story, but these tough men, sporting tattoos, are not what they appear. "On fait comme on dit" is a comedy, and these guys could be descendants of the Keystone Cops. They are dreamers not gangsters. So much is riding on this bank heist, the pressure is intense.

I had a good time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":415,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-09-30","keywords":"wine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1655160345","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDBlNjI0ZjUtN2FiNS00Yzg3LWJjNWQtNDU3OTZhOTU2M2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDBlNjI0ZjUtN2FiNS00Yzg3LWJjNWQtNDU3OTZhOTU2M2YxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0512071/","name":"Vincent Lindon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12571544/","name":"Matei Dussarps","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0033389/","name":"Pascale Arbillot"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0468007/","name":"Jan Kounen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030029/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022869/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736676/","name":"Fabrice Roger-Lacan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0468007/","name":"Jan Kounen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0512071/","name":"Vincent Lindon"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The writing, the acting, the cast, are all perfect. It is so rare that you find a show with such a diverse cast coming together so seamlessly. Each character is perfectly cast. The writing allows you to live each chactors journey throughout each scene. You do not know who's side you are on; all you know is they are all "right" in their convictions in some way. The tension and life within this show makes you feel it as though you are there. Re- watch to find details you may have missed the first time.

The writing, the acting, the cast, are all perfect. It is so rare that you find a show with such a diverse cast coming together so seamlessly. Each character is perfectly cast. The writing allows you to live each chactors journey throughout each scene. You do not know who's side you are on; all you know is they are all "right" in their convictions in some way. The tension and life within this show makes you feel it as though you are there. Re- watch to find details you may have missed the first time. It is a thriller, drama, comedy, tragedy, and fairytale all in one. Watch the show to find out which character resonates with you ethics and morals. The lines may be harder to see than you think. The cast are living their roles and their conviction is riveting.

But that epic-worthy premise gets weighed down by a search for a brother who's gone AWOL, run-ins with Russian military (which is okay if they weren't made into villains), and multitudes of minor story branches that just seem to drag the story into smaller issues that muddle the show and makes the story feel small.

Kitsch does a passable job, but the show can't seem to make up its mind on whether he's a scrappy street cop or a polished NY police brass savvy in the ways of bureaucracy and politics. I suppose it's part of his backstory, but to me, it feels unnecessary, just like all the f-bombs casually thrown in.\n\nDespite all its shortcomings, the show is beautifully shot, the acting is mostly good (mostly the Germans), and there is a main story that makes its way through, I think.

I saw it in everything from the pursed lips to body mannerisms and that spit take, and smiled because I adore both men.\n\nThis is a film that picks up steam as it goes, after its setup that has normally-lovable Chaplin established as a serial killer preying on women for their wealth. I was amused and liked all of the times Chaplin breaks the 4th wall by looking directly into the camera, speaking to us with his eyes, but I only really started loving the film when he meets a young woman he intends to test a poison on. From there the scene out on that boat fishing with Martha Raye is hilarious, and the film doesn't let up with its misdirections.\n\nWeirdly, there is both a humanity here in Chaplin's character but also a monster, and there is also a comment on mankind. The end of the film is set in 1937 but it's certainly the Chaplin of 1947 who tells us: "As for being a mass killer, does not the world encourage it? Is it not building weapons of destruction for the sole purpose of mass killing? Has it not blown unsuspecting women and little children to pieces? And done it very scientifically? As a mass killer, I am an amateur by comparison." Not that the character has a leg to stand on morally, but it's a fascinating comment just a couple of years after Hiroshima/Nagasaki and the dawning of the atomic age.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16747,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1947-10-23","keywords":"villain played by lead actor,serial killer,black comedy,execution,polygamy","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000122/","name":"Charles Chaplin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180900/","name":"Mady Correll"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734467/","name":"Allison Roddan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000122/","name":"Charles Chaplin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028083/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000122/","name":"Charles Chaplin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000080/","name":"Orson Welles"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I saw it in everything from the pursed lips to body mannerisms and that spit take, and smiled because I adore both men.\n\nThis is a film that picks up steam as it goes, after its setup that has normally-lovable Chaplin established as a serial killer preying on women for their wealth. I was amused and liked all of the times Chaplin breaks the 4th wall by looking directly into the camera, speaking to us with his eyes, but I only really started loving the film when he meets a young woman he intends to test a poison on. From there the scene out on that boat fishing with Martha Raye is hilarious, and the film doesn't let up with its misdirections.\n\nWeirdly, there is both a humanity here in Chaplin's character but also a monster, and there is also a comment on mankind. The end of the film is set in 1937 but it's certainly the Chaplin of 1947 who tells us: "As for being a mass killer, does not the world encourage it? Is it not building weapons of destruction for the sole purpose of mass killing? Has it not blown unsuspecting women and little children to pieces? And done it very scientifically? As a mass killer, I am an amateur by comparison." Not that the character has a leg to stand on morally, but it's a fascinating comment just a couple of years after Hiroshima/Nagasaki and the dawning of the atomic age.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16747,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"Passed","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1947-10-23","keywords":"villain played by lead actor,serial killer,black comedy,execution,polygamy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000122/","name":"Charles Chaplin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180900/","name":"Mady Correll","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734467/","name":"Allison Roddan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000122/","name":"Charles Chaplin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028083/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000122/","name":"Charles Chaplin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000080/","name":"Orson Welles"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It also reflects the intense differences between social classes, intellectual trends and political forces that would lead to the acts of "contestazione generale" in the late 1960s. \n\nWIth "Uccellacci", we can learn some of Pasolini's thoughts on Marxism, Fascism, religion, the Catholic church, the role of intellectuals, the bourgeoisie, political parties, the dire conditions of the campesinato and the borgate (slums), poverty, greed, famine, cultural and social apartheid -- you name it. That's the main problem with this passionately personal and visually stunning walking-road-movie: too many targets, too little time to hit them all in the bull's eye.\n\nA natural follow-up to his documentary "Comizi d'Amore" (1965) -- in which he traveled all over Italy interviewing people about their thoughts on love and sex -- Pasolini shows in "Uccellacci e Uccellini" the unofficial apartheid in Italy, a basically "unmelting" pot of dozens of different ethnic, linguistic and cultural backgrounds "artificially" unified in mid-19th century but still plagued by social/economical/cultural chasm. And he also denounces the sterility of the discourse of the "official-left" intelligentsia, which he clearly despised (and which heavily attacked him on many issues and occasions).\n\nIn the Italy of the 1960s, the Left was concerned with the struggle of workers, intellectuals and students against the establishment; the contadini (peasants) weren't even properly considered as a political force -- they were the symbol of archaic, pre-boom Italy. Pasolini was the main voice to take the side of the peasants; against famine, sophism falls flat, as the intellectual crow will shockingly discover at the end of "Uccellacci". The political discourse can no longer be theoretical; it has to be urgent, pragmatic, directed towards action. Godard, Bertolucci, Alea, Ruy Guerra, Resnais and others also approached the theme at the time; but, unlike the majority of intellectual-filmmakers of the 60s, Pasolini ACTUALLY had had a rural (though highly literate) background.\n\nWildly (in)famous at the time as poet/filmmaker/writer/anti-Vatican political activist (but, contrary to a false general belief, he was never a gay militant, though he certainly wasn't in the closet), Pasolini picks up the journey into the "Italia profonda" from Visconti's "Ossessione" and "La Terra Trema" to most of Rossellini and leaves his own distinctive signature in the very complex era of the economic boom. \n\nPasolini smartly uses the parable genre with much comic relief so he can talk about serious political issues in a "commercial" film, relying heavily on veteran champion Totò's immense talent, charisma and experience. In one of his last films, Totò is joined by 16 year-old newcomer Ninetto Davoli, here in a completely relaxed, natural performance; they make a perfect duo. The cinematography by master Tonino delli Colli features jaw- dropping locations and compositions. The music by Ennio Morricone is memorable, his very personal touch instantly recognizable; and there are funny sung (!) opening credits. There are two minor letdowns that prevent total audience adhesion: 1) it lacks a brighter tempo, the rhythm falters at times; 2) the episodes are rather loosely linked 3) there are episodes which might be shorter (the wonderful but overlong St. Francis story) and others might be longer (the visit to the rich landowner's house).\n\n"Uccellacci e Uccellinni" is a very personal Pasolini ("my favorite" he said in a 1969 interview) and one of his few films not based on literature classics, mythology or the Bible.

"Accatone" is, at its best, a chunk of life, which Pasolini managed to extract not as it initially was, but dramatically filtered through his own personal lyrical gaze. Gangs, prostitutes, lies and deceit lie in this film's core. A sense of irresponsible opportunism is seen in this film, almost no regrets for the past and no fears for the future. In fact, the movie's tragic hero, Vittorio Accatone, is a dark alter-ego of yet another favored Italian movie character, embodied only a year before by Marcello Mastroianni in "La Dolce Vita". Perhaps, in this case, Accatone was not a party animal journalist who sought ephemeral pleasure in social middle-class gatherings and women, but the spirit is, by itself, maintained astonishingly faithfully: Accatone is no longer a protagonist in Pasolini's movie, doomed to descend lower and lower in social class, losing both his dignity, his social acceptability and his profound "style", but a symbol, a metaphor for Pasolini's own political beliefs. Under this figure of a brute, behind the otherwise repelling image of a short dirty man with a sly smile and a peculiar walk, lies the failure of post war Italian government, a government which, according to this movie's subtext, strove so hopelessly to attain social and economical success for Rome's population, and somehow neglected or marginalized Rome's peripheries, causing people like Accatone and his girlfriends to result in prostitution and theft.

"Accatone" is, at its best, a chunk of life, which Pasolini managed to extract not as it initially was, but dramatically filtered through his own personal lyrical gaze. Gangs, prostitutes, lies and deceit lie in this film's core. A sense of irresponsible opportunism is seen in this film, almost no regrets for the past and no fears for the future. In fact, the movie's tragic hero, Vittorio Accatone, is a dark alter-ego of yet another favored Italian movie character, embodied only a year before by Marcello Mastroianni in "La Dolce Vita". Perhaps, in this case, Accatone was not a party animal journalist who sought ephemeral pleasure in social middle-class gatherings and women, but the spirit is, by itself, maintained astonishingly faithfully: Accatone is no longer a protagonist in Pasolini's movie, doomed to descend lower and lower in social class, losing both his dignity, his social acceptability and his profound "style", but a symbol, a metaphor for Pasolini's own political beliefs.

As an Italian that grew up in the 90s in a left-wing family, to me this movie resonates incredibly well with the clash between supportes of Berlusconi (whose personality is extremely close to Santenocito's) and the, he claimed (with some truth) "red" judiciary and left-wing Italians. In general, until the first decade of the XXI century this reciprocal mistrust and ongoing accusation between left wing and right wing was very alive in Italy. We on the left believed to be morally superior people opposing a small-minded business-oriented hedonist hypocrite right and centre that ended up representing all the evil we perceived in "Italianness"(once more, exactly what this 70s movie is about).

It stars Hurd Hatfield, George Sanders, Angela Lansbury, Donna Reed, Peter Lawford, Lowell Gilmore, Richard Fraser and Douglas Walton. Music is by Herbert Stothart and cinematography by Harry Stradling Sr.\n\nDorian Gray of Mayfair and Selby.\n\nOscar Wilde's Faustian tale about a young Victorian gentleman who sells his soul to retain his youth is given a magnificent make-over by MGM. Pumping into it a budget reputedly of $2 million, the look and feel is perfect for this macabre observation of vanity, greed and self destruction. In many ways it's still an under valued movie, mainly because there will always be Wilde purists who think it lacks the writer's poetic spikiness, while horror fans quite often venture into the picture expecting some sort of violent classic ripe with sex, drugs and debauchery unbound.\n\nLewin crafts his film in understated manner, never allowing the themes in the source material to become overblown just for dramatic purpose. He cloaks it all with an atmosphere of eeriness, thus keeping the debasing nature of Dorian Gray subdued. The horror aspects here mostly are implied or discussed in elegantly stated conversations, where the horror in fact is purely in the characterisation of Dorian himself. We really don't need to see actual things on screen, we are urged to be chilled to the marrow by his mere presence, and this works because Lewin has personalised us into this man's sinful descent by way of careful pacing and character formation.\n\nThere are some jolt moments of course, notably the famous inserts of Technicolor into the black and white film, the impact of such bringing the portrait of the title thundering into our conscious. However, this is not about thrill rides and titillation, because the film, like its source, is intellectual. Lewin is aided considerably by Stradling's beautiful photography, which in turn either vividly realises the opulent abodes or darkens the dens of iniquities, so just like Lewin, Stradling and the art department work wonders and prove to be fine purveyors of their craft.\n\nHatfield is wonderful, it's an inspired piece of casting, with his angular features and cold dead eyes, he effortlessly suggests the black heart now beating where once there was a soul. Yet even he, and the rest of the impressive cast, are trumped by Sanders as Lord Henry. Cynical, brutal yet rich with witticisms, in Sanders' excellent hands Lord Henry becomes the smiling devil like mentor perched on Dorian's shoulder. Dorian and Lord Henry are movie monsters, proof positive that not all monsters need to be seen hacking off limbs or drinking blood. In this case, the decaying of the soul is a far more terrifying experience.\n\nFascinating, eloquent, intelligent and frightening. 9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12492,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1945-03-03","keywords":"painting,painter,soul,hedonist,deal with the devil","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Picture of Dorian Gray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2741026585","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmI4MGI4YWMtZmVlNS00ZmQyLWI1N2YtMmU0M2ZjYjJjYzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001695/","name":"George Sanders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0368836/","name":"Hurd Hatfield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001656/","name":"Donna Reed"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506797/","name":"Albert Lewin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0928492/","name":"Oscar Wilde"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Aware that its civilisation was decaying, the Austrian ruling class of Kafka's day could summon up no vitality or creativity, and devoted itself to suppressing 'The Revolution'.  A state with thirteen languages and twice that number of separatist movements spent all its time trying to retard its own centrifugal forces.  Austria-Hungary in these final decades was a honeyless hive in which minor officials and secret policemen busied themselves, striving feverishly to preserve the unpreservable.  Kafka's dark novels capture the ugly mood of a dying political system whose instincts were authoritarian and whose inefficiency sapped all hope of reform.\n\nIn 1962, Welles was struggling through his locust years.  Having long since alienated himself from Hollywood's money, he was living a vagabond life in Europe, flitting back and forth across the continent to scrape funds together, plan stage productions which hardly ever came to fruition, and sleepwalk through a dozen cameo roles in other people's films.  The critical and financial catastrophe of 'Chimes' was hanging over him like a pall, and he had far too many distractions - squabbles with his Irish partners, tax bills in London and potentially ruinous law suits to stave off.  With all this to contend with, he was still sporadically shooting portions of "Don Quixote" in Spain, a stuttering project that was by now in its sixth year of filming.  Welles was desperately short of money, and as his biographer Higham puts it, "he could manage almost anything except austerity".\n\nA harmless, inconsequential clerk wakes up one morning to find himself accused of something (he never discovers what).  Secret policemen enter his bedroom and subject him to a frightening interrogation in which every answer provokes a new line of questioning.  This is psychological torture, the mind's innate sense of justice constantly probing for some higher reference-point, some appeal to fairness, when in fact none exists.  Josef K returns repeatedly to the obvious question, "But what have I done?"  But there are no rules of justice here, no recourse to an autonomous code of law.  "You have the unmitigated gall to pretend you don't know?"\n\nA cry of anguish from the individual who finds himself overwhelmed by soulless bureaucracy, "The Trial" is a deeply personal statement by Welles, and as Higham puts it, "a symbol, if there ever was one, of his own career". Welles had been the enfant terrible whose erratic genius had alienated the big Hollywood studios.  Cut off from the big money, he was to spend the subsequent forty years globetrotting aimlessly, picking up work as best he could.\n\nAutobiographical elements of Kafka's own life, contained in "The Trial", are given prominence in the film.  Austria-Hungary launched World War One in the same year that Kafka began work on the novel.  Ironically, the limited war against Bosnia, intended to restore Austria's international credibility, turned into a conflagration bigger and more horrific than anything previously experienced on earth, and set in train the global violence which was to characterise the twentieth century.  It also destroyed Austria-Hungary.  Welles closes this story of 1914 with an image of nuclear catastrophe, stressing the oneness of the century's horror.  Kafka was bullied by his father, and reference is made in the course of the film to K's sense of filial guilt.  The office is depressing and demeaning, echoing Kafka's own experiences as a clerk in a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nThe State is remorseless and pitiless, grinding down and perverting even the strongest of human bonds, those of familial and sexual love.  K is forced to reject his little cousin Irmie (Maydra Shore), who has to remain 'outside'.  Later, an allegation of sexual impropriety concerning Irmie arises.  Any magnanimity towards another is interpreted by the authorities as a denunciation.  The torture scenes involving the secret policemen are the most disturbing part of the film, both because K realises how his own protests have borne poisoinous fruit, and because of the grinning obsequiousness of the victims.  The State turns its problems into spineless curs who acquiesce in their own degradation.\n\nNot only does K find himself becoming an accuser: he even assumes the role of interrogator, questioning Bloch and the Defendants.  Anyone who is not a keyholder within the pitiless apparatus of The State cannot help but take on its deadly pallor.  Keys are important.  Leni, the Court Guard and Zitorelli are empowered through possessing keys.  They are a corrupt priesthood in this cult of political disease.\n\nKafka's experiences with women were deeply ambivalent.  He had many intense relationships in his life, none of which proved satisfactory.  His book treats women as both temptresses and objects of loathing.  Welles follows this line, the women being desirable guide-figures and also deformed monstrosities.  The trunk-carrier, Lena and the hunchback girl all have bodily malformations.\n\nWelles shot most of the film in Zagreb, capturing strikingly the two clashing styles of architecture of Mittel-Europa, overblown ugly Habsburg baroque and drab communist functionalism.  It is as if the Prague of Mozart cannot help but decay into the Prague of Krushchev.  "Ostensibly free" is the best K can hope for, and 'ostensibly individual' is our optimum condition, as the shadows of the Stalinist apartment blocks crowd in on us."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20470,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1962-12-22","keywords":"dystopia,judicial system,surrealism,paranoia,kafka esque","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Trial","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2136456217","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUwOTExYmUtMmYwNi00NDA0LWFlNGUtZTA1NjI0Yzg1ZDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUwOTExYmUtMmYwNi00NDA0LWFlNGUtZTA1NjI0Yzg1ZDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000578/","name":"Anthony Perkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0289450/","name":"Arnoldo Foà"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0353916/","name":"Jess Hahn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000080/","name":"Orson Welles"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057637/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086394/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017070/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0158971/","name":"Pierre Cholot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0434525/","name":"Franz Kafka"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000080/","name":"Orson Welles"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Aware that its civilisation was decaying, the Austrian ruling class of Kafka's day could summon up no vitality or creativity, and devoted itself to suppressing 'The Revolution'.  A state with thirteen languages and twice that number of separatist movements spent all its time trying to retard its own centrifugal forces.  Austria-Hungary in these final decades was a honeyless hive in which minor officials and secret policemen busied themselves, striving feverishly to preserve the unpreservable.  Kafka's dark novels capture the ugly mood of a dying political system whose instincts were authoritarian and whose inefficiency sapped all hope of reform.\n\nIn 1962, Welles was struggling through his locust years.  Having long since alienated himself from Hollywood's money, he was living a vagabond life in Europe, flitting back and forth across the continent to scrape funds together, plan stage productions which hardly ever came to fruition, and sleepwalk through a dozen cameo roles in other people's films.  The critical and financial catastrophe of 'Chimes' was hanging over him like a pall, and he had far too many distractions - squabbles with his Irish partners, tax bills in London and potentially ruinous law suits to stave off.  With all this to contend with, he was still sporadically shooting portions of "Don Quixote" in Spain, a stuttering project that was by now in its sixth year of filming.  Welles was desperately short of money, and as his biographer Higham puts it, "he could manage almost anything except austerity".\n\nA harmless, inconsequential clerk wakes up one morning to find himself accused of something (he never discovers what).  Secret policemen enter his bedroom and subject him to a frightening interrogation in which every answer provokes a new line of questioning.  This is psychological torture, the mind's innate sense of justice constantly probing for some higher reference-point, some appeal to fairness, when in fact none exists.  Josef K returns repeatedly to the obvious question, "But what have I done?"  But there are no rules of justice here, no recourse to an autonomous code of law.  "You have the unmitigated gall to pretend you don't know?"\n\nA cry of anguish from the individual who finds himself overwhelmed by soulless bureaucracy, "The Trial" is a deeply personal statement by Welles, and as Higham puts it, "a symbol, if there ever was one, of his own career". Welles had been the enfant terrible whose erratic genius had alienated the big Hollywood studios.  Cut off from the big money, he was to spend the subsequent forty years globetrotting aimlessly, picking up work as best he could.\n\nAutobiographical elements of Kafka's own life, contained in "The Trial", are given prominence in the film.  Austria-Hungary launched World War One in the same year that Kafka began work on the novel.  Ironically, the limited war against Bosnia, intended to restore Austria's international credibility, turned into a conflagration bigger and more horrific than anything previously experienced on earth, and set in train the global violence which was to characterise the twentieth century.  It also destroyed Austria-Hungary.  Welles closes this story of 1914 with an image of nuclear catastrophe, stressing the oneness of the century's horror.  Kafka was bullied by his father, and reference is made in the course of the film to K's sense of filial guilt.  The office is depressing and demeaning, echoing Kafka's own experiences as a clerk in a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nThe State is remorseless and pitiless, grinding down and perverting even the strongest of human bonds, those of familial and sexual love.  K is forced to reject his little cousin Irmie (Maydra Shore), who has to remain 'outside'.  Later, an allegation of sexual impropriety concerning Irmie arises.  Any magnanimity towards another is interpreted by the authorities as a denunciation.  The torture scenes involving the secret policemen are the most disturbing part of the film, both because K realises how his own protests have borne poisoinous fruit, and because of the grinning obsequiousness of the victims.  The State turns its problems into spineless curs who acquiesce in their own degradation.\n\nNot only does K find himself becoming an accuser: he even assumes the role of interrogator, questioning Bloch and the Defendants.  Anyone who is not a keyholder within the pitiless apparatus of The State cannot help but take on its deadly pallor.  Keys are important.  Leni, the Court Guard and Zitorelli are empowered through possessing keys.  They are a corrupt priesthood in this cult of political disease.\n\nKafka's experiences with women were deeply ambivalent.  He had many intense relationships in his life, none of which proved satisfactory.  His book treats women as both temptresses and objects of loathing.  Welles follows this line, the women being desirable guide-figures and also deformed monstrosities.  The trunk-carrier, Lena and the hunchback girl all have bodily malformations.\n\nWelles shot most of the film in Zagreb, capturing strikingly the two clashing styles of architecture of Mittel-Europa, overblown ugly Habsburg baroque and drab communist functionalism.  It is as if the Prague of Mozart cannot help but decay into the Prague of Krushchev.  "Ostensibly free" is the best K can hope for, and 'ostensibly individual' is our optimum condition, as the shadows of the Stalinist apartment blocks crowd in on us.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20470,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1962-12-22","keywords":"dystopia,judicial system,surrealism,paranoia,kafka esque","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Trial","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2136456217","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUwOTExYmUtMmYwNi00NDA0LWFlNGUtZTA1NjI0Yzg1ZDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUwOTExYmUtMmYwNi00NDA0LWFlNGUtZTA1NjI0Yzg1ZDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000578/","name":"Anthony Perkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0289450/","name":"Arnoldo Foà","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0353916/","name":"Jess Hahn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000080/","name":"Orson Welles"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057637/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086394/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017070/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0158971/","name":"Pierre Cholot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0434525/","name":"Franz Kafka","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000080/","name":"Orson Welles"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It had been one of the scandalous, passionate, and morbid stories of the interwar period, a story that competed on the front pages of Parisian newspapers in 1933 with the news about Adolf Hitler's rise to power in Germany, and which had divided the French public opinion into two camps, as no another sensational affair had since the Dreyfus case. The heroine of the gloomy story was a 16-year-old girl from a working / mid-class neighborhood, who had poisoned her parents. The father had died but the mother survived. The investigation revealed the double life of a girl suffocated by the environment in which she lived, considered a sinister criminal by some and a victim of social conditions and a perverse family environment by others. However, Chabrol only mentions in passing the media scandal around this case, being rather fascinated by the young woman's personality and also fascinating his spectators in the way he tells the story of the crime and the circumstances that led to its committing.\n\nThe whole film revolves around the heroine played by Isabelle Huppert. The script is quite faithful to the story, presents the facts as reported by the press of the time and does not try to serve surprises or insert speculative interpretations about the reasons for the actions and the psychological sources of the acts committed by the young woman. The director's attention is focused on reconstructing the confined and devoid of personal separation in which the Noziere family lives, the bohemian environment in which the young high school girl spends her time in the company of students, crooks, and old bourgeois who take advantage of the youth of girls in need for money or sensations. Rejecting both moral judgments and psychoanalytic interpretations, Chabrol lets Isabelle Huppert build the role of the girl who, instead of teenage dreams, plunges into promiscuity, and who travels from adolescent rebellion to murder with an impassive coldness. We don't find too many reasons in the film that would put us as spectators in the camp of Violette's supporters, except for the personality of the actress who fills the role with gloomy feelings and self-destructive tension.\n\nIsabelle Huppert achieves with the part of Violette in this film one of the first great roles of a fabulous career. She is supported by Stéphane Audran (the director's second wife, whom he would break up after 14 years of marriage and many remarkable films in the same year 1978) and Jean Carmet, one of those talented French actors whom Chabrol was giving the opportunity of consistent parts even if they were not first rank stars. A special award should be given to those who recognize Fabrice Luchini in one of the first roles of his film career. The style of the story is interesting and elaborate, temporally separated frames continue visually one another, flashbacks and imaginary scenes (especially from Violetta's fantasies or nightmares) are interleaved nervously and non-linearly, but perfectly following the logic of the action. 'Violette Noziere' manages to describe the interwar social environment, with social contradictions, moral prejudices, inequalities and stigmas related to the status of women and the pressure of the press of sensation. The film also intents to be a psychological study into the motives of the crime. Here, I think intentionally, the answer is not clear. We are shown the conditions that can generate crime, but not the gates that open between reality and horror. Judgments belong to us, the spectators.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2246,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1978-05-24","keywords":"teenage girl,male frontal nudity,male nudity,reference to louis xvi,reference to the dreyfus affair","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000804/","name":"Stéphane Audran"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0138405/","name":"Jean Carmet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001031/","name":"Claude Chabrol"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015884/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061460/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060193/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0058286/","name":"Odile Barski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111302/","name":"Hervé Bromberger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0340190/","name":"Frédéric Grendel"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Spoiler","reviewBody":"The movie from time to time flashes across my mind after I discovered the songs of Yves Montand. He sang well and I always want to see whether he acted well.\n\nJust my luck that DVD of this title was and is still not easily available in town. Why? It is not a movie for green whippersnappers or precocious imps but the well-aged wise. It was filmed some twenty years ago and I then exactly lacked twenty years' maturity. My big thank you to the 27th French Cinepanorama held in this month, after having gained twenty more years experience in life, now I know how to enjoy this movie. If I saw the movie right after it was freshly produced in 1983, I am very sure I would not understand the main plot or subplot, the observant director Claude Sautet, not to mention his ideas. After all, Yves Montand is now lying six feet under inside the cemetery Père-Lachaise in Paris and Jacques Villeret (Gilbert)'s head has gone half-bald in the French box-office hit "Le Dîner de cons" where he plays the tricked "François Pignon".\n\nThe restaurant setting reminds me the frantic and noisy kitchen in "Dinner Rush": shouting chef, cooking heat, fire and smell, the orderly mess, clicking sound of cutlery and crockery, conflict between waiters and chef.\n\nThere are usually many subplots in Sautet's works because he was able to capture human sentiments, especially those of ordinary people leading ordinary life, well in details and display it with an undertone of melancholy humour, even for serious subjects like human alienation, one of the ideas showcased in Garçon!.\n\nResourceful Alex was once a tap dancer, though not very accomplished, he seems to be respected in the dancing room. With limited funds and resources, this maturing restaurant waiter aspires to start an amusement park on the beach and he makes it! "Jerry Maguire" is the American version of Alex. Both men are capable of winning the heart of many. Every one around them likes them. They go around women one after one pretty successfully, it's nothing novel to see that they have two or three at one time. For instance, Alex has frequent trysts with rich poodle Gloria, from whom he tactfully draws out a free-interest loan of FFr100,000. Besides, he is concurrently after Claire, an English language instructor whom he knew seventeen years ago at her father's wedding on a boat. On top of these two relationships, he keeps a punctuated contact with the down-and-out Coline.\n\nOn the surface, both Jerry and Alex are candies to all. Cruelly and honestly, it is Gilbert, Alex's room-mate and colleague, who is sharp at pointing out their common blind spot: they are not related to anybody, both American Jerry and French Alex only think about themselves. What different is, Jerry's ending gives us hope while the final rainy scene of Alex at his well-received amusement park tells us what reality tends to be like: remaining alone.\n\nWhen Alex is successful with his career, his dream park, all his women left: both Gloria and Claire return to their husbands, Coline follows a younger waiter of the restaurant. To Alex, the lyrics of the golden oldie should be revised to be "And 'NOT' in my hour of need, I truly am, indeed, alone again, naturally."","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":728,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"genre":["Drama","Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1983-11-09","keywords":"french,france,seaside,one word title,exclamation point in title","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0598971/","name":"Yves Montand"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305368/","name":"Nicole Garcia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898317/","name":"Jacques Villeret"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767110/","name":"Claude Sautet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067540/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046777/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767110/","name":"Claude Sautet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196362/","name":"Jean-Loup Dabadie"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Spoiler","reviewBody":"The movie from time to time flashes across my mind after I discovered the songs of Yves Montand. He sang well and I always want to see whether he acted well.\n\nJust my luck that DVD of this title was and is still not easily available in town. Why? It is not a movie for green whippersnappers or precocious imps but the well-aged wise. It was filmed some twenty years ago and I then exactly lacked twenty years' maturity. My big thank you to the 27th French Cinepanorama held in this month, after having gained twenty more years experience in life, now I know how to enjoy this movie. If I saw the movie right after it was freshly produced in 1983, I am very sure I would not understand the main plot or subplot, the observant director Claude Sautet, not to mention his ideas. After all, Yves Montand is now lying six feet under inside the cemetery Père-Lachaise in Paris and Jacques Villeret (Gilbert)'s head has gone half-bald in the French box-office hit "Le Dîner de cons" where he plays the tricked "François Pignon".\n\nThe restaurant setting reminds me the frantic and noisy kitchen in "Dinner Rush": shouting chef, cooking heat, fire and smell, the orderly mess, clicking sound of cutlery and crockery, conflict between waiters and chef.\n\nThere are usually many subplots in Sautet's works because he was able to capture human sentiments, especially those of ordinary people leading ordinary life, well in details and display it with an undertone of melancholy humour, even for serious subjects like human alienation, one of the ideas showcased in Garçon!.\n\nResourceful Alex was once a tap dancer, though not very accomplished, he seems to be respected in the dancing room. With limited funds and resources, this maturing restaurant waiter aspires to start an amusement park on the beach and he makes it! "Jerry Maguire" is the American version of Alex. Both men are capable of winning the heart of many. Every one around them likes them. They go around women one after one pretty successfully, it's nothing novel to see that they have two or three at one time. For instance, Alex has frequent trysts with rich poodle Gloria, from whom he tactfully draws out a free-interest loan of FFr100,000. Besides, he is concurrently after Claire, an English language instructor whom he knew seventeen years ago at her father's wedding on a boat. On top of these two relationships, he keeps a punctuated contact with the down-and-out Coline.\n\nOn the surface, both Jerry and Alex are candies to all. Cruelly and honestly, it is Gilbert, Alex's room-mate and colleague, who is sharp at pointing out their common blind spot: they are not related to anybody, both American Jerry and French Alex only think about themselves. What different is, Jerry's ending gives us hope while the final rainy scene of Alex at his well-received amusement park tells us what reality tends to be like: remaining alone.\n\nWhen Alex is successful with his career, his dream park, all his women left: both Gloria and Claire return to their husbands, Coline follows a younger waiter of the restaurant. To Alex, the lyrics of the golden oldie should be revised to be "And 'NOT' in my hour of need, I truly am, indeed, alone again, naturally."","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":728,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Drama","Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1983-11-09","keywords":"french,france,seaside,one word title,exclamation point in title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0598971/","name":"Yves Montand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305368/","name":"Nicole Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898317/","name":"Jacques Villeret"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767110/","name":"Claude Sautet"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067540/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046777/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767110/","name":"Claude Sautet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196362/","name":"Jean-Loup Dabadie"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Against the will of its elderly male and his adult niece residents, the Nazis commandeer a house for one of their officers, Lt. Werner von Ebrennac, to live in for as long as he is in the area on Nazi business. As a figurative and literal silent protest against the Nazis and the officer, the uncle and niece do whatever is required of them while the officer is in their house, however they do not acknowledge his presence, living largely in silence whenever he is around. The officer treats the housing situation with care, like he is a guest. Although not a nightly occurrence, the officer begins an evening routine with his reluctant hosts: in his civilian clothes, he knocks on the door of the room in which they have convened for the evening, walking in shortly thereafter knowing that no acknowledgment will be made for him to enter, he visits with them for no more than five minutes before he bids them a good evening as he exits. During these visits, he speaks reverently about, among other things, culture - music and literature in particular as he is a composer and musician - his national pride, his love of France, and what he hopes will emerge from the war, namely a strong and free France, stronger than it was before the war, and the marriage between the French and German cultures which will enrich the lives of all Europeans. All the while, he makes no expectations from them, either to listen, or to answer if they are indeed listening. At the end of what ends up being his six month stay at the house, he does end up having a profound effect on the uncle and niece, despite that effect being largely unacknowledged, as his stay in France has a profound effect on him, opening up his eyes to the reality of the war based largely on his first ever visit into Paris." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0039822/","name":"Le silence de la mer","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJjM2ZkZTEtZDM0My00YzU2LWEzNTMtMWExNDY3OWNmYjlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"1941 in a small town in Nazi occupied France.

Aware that its civilisation was decaying, the Austrian ruling class of Kafka's day could summon up no vitality or creativity, and devoted itself to suppressing 'The Revolution'.  A state with thirteen languages and twice that number of separatist movements spent all its time trying to retard its own centrifugal forces.  Austria-Hungary in these final decades was a honeyless hive in which minor officials and secret policemen busied themselves, striving feverishly to preserve the unpreservable.  Kafka's dark novels capture the ugly mood of a dying political system whose instincts were authoritarian and whose inefficiency sapped all hope of reform.\n\nIn 1962, Welles was struggling through his locust years.  Having long since alienated himself from Hollywood's money, he was living a vagabond life in Europe, flitting back and forth across the continent to scrape funds together, plan stage productions which hardly ever came to fruition, and sleepwalk through a dozen cameo roles in other people's films.  The critical and financial catastrophe of 'Chimes' was hanging over him like a pall, and he had far too many distractions - squabbles with his Irish partners, tax bills in London and potentially ruinous law suits to stave off.  With all this to contend with, he was still sporadically shooting portions of "Don Quixote" in Spain, a stuttering project that was by now in its sixth year of filming.  Welles was desperately short of money, and as his biographer Higham puts it, "he could manage almost anything except austerity".\n\nA harmless, inconsequential clerk wakes up one morning to find himself accused of something (he never discovers what).  Secret policemen enter his bedroom and subject him to a frightening interrogation in which every answer provokes a new line of questioning.  This is psychological torture, the mind's innate sense of justice constantly probing for some higher reference-point, some appeal to fairness, when in fact none exists.  Josef K returns repeatedly to the obvious question, "But what have I done?"  But there are no rules of justice here, no recourse to an autonomous code of law.  "You have the unmitigated gall to pretend you don't know?"\n\nA cry of anguish from the individual who finds himself overwhelmed by soulless bureaucracy, "The Trial" is a deeply personal statement by Welles, and as Higham puts it, "a symbol, if there ever was one, of his own career". Welles had been the enfant terrible whose erratic genius had alienated the big Hollywood studios.  Cut off from the big money, he was to spend the subsequent forty years globetrotting aimlessly, picking up work as best he could.\n\nAutobiographical elements of Kafka's own life, contained in "The Trial", are given prominence in the film.  Austria-Hungary launched World War One in the same year that Kafka began work on the novel.  Ironically, the limited war against Bosnia, intended to restore Austria's international credibility, turned into a conflagration bigger and more horrific than anything previously experienced on earth, and set in train the global violence which was to characterise the twentieth century.  It also destroyed Austria-Hungary.  Welles closes this story of 1914 with an image of nuclear catastrophe, stressing the oneness of the century's horror.  Kafka was bullied by his father, and reference is made in the course of the film to K's sense of filial guilt.  The office is depressing and demeaning, echoing Kafka's own experiences as a clerk in a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nThe State is remorseless and pitiless, grinding down and perverting even the strongest of human bonds, those of familial and sexual love.  K is forced to reject his little cousin Irmie (Maydra Shore), who has to remain 'outside'.  Later, an allegation of sexual impropriety concerning Irmie arises.  Any magnanimity towards another is interpreted by the authorities as a denunciation.  The torture scenes involving the secret policemen are the most disturbing part of the film, both because K realises how his own protests have borne poisoinous fruit, and because of the grinning obsequiousness of the victims.  The State turns its problems into spineless curs who acquiesce in their own degradation.\n\nNot only does K find himself becoming an accuser: he even assumes the role of interrogator, questioning Bloch and the Defendants.  Anyone who is not a keyholder within the pitiless apparatus of The State cannot help but take on its deadly pallor.  Keys are important.  Leni, the Court Guard and Zitorelli are empowered through possessing keys.  They are a corrupt priesthood in this cult of political disease.\n\nKafka's experiences with women were deeply ambivalent.  He had many intense relationships in his life, none of which proved satisfactory.  His book treats women as both temptresses and objects of loathing.  Welles follows this line, the women being desirable guide-figures and also deformed monstrosities.  The trunk-carrier, Lena and the hunchback girl all have bodily malformations.\n\nWelles shot most of the film in Zagreb, capturing strikingly the two clashing styles of architecture of Mittel-Europa, overblown ugly Habsburg baroque and drab communist functionalism.  It is as if the Prague of Mozart cannot help but decay into the Prague of Krushchev.  "Ostensibly free" is the best K can hope for, and 'ostensibly individual' is our optimum condition, as the shadows of the Stalinist apartment blocks crowd in on us."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20470,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1962-12-22","keywords":"dystopia,judicial system,surrealism,paranoia,kafka esque","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Trial","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2136456217","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUwOTExYmUtMmYwNi00NDA0LWFlNGUtZTA1NjI0Yzg1ZDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUwOTExYmUtMmYwNi00NDA0LWFlNGUtZTA1NjI0Yzg1ZDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000578/","name":"Anthony Perkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0289450/","name":"Arnoldo Foà"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0353916/","name":"Jess Hahn"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000080/","name":"Orson Welles"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057637/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086394/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017070/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0158971/","name":"Pierre Cholot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0434525/","name":"Franz Kafka"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000080/","name":"Orson Welles"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Having long since alienated himself from Hollywood's money, he was living a vagabond life in Europe, flitting back and forth across the continent to scrape funds together, plan stage productions which hardly ever came to fruition, and sleepwalk through a dozen cameo roles in other people's films.  The critical and financial catastrophe of 'Chimes' was hanging over him like a pall, and he had far too many distractions - squabbles with his Irish partners, tax bills in London and potentially ruinous law suits to stave off.  With all this to contend with, he was still sporadically shooting portions of "Don Quixote" in Spain, a stuttering project that was by now in its sixth year of filming.  Welles was desperately short of money, and as his biographer Higham puts it, "he could manage almost anything except austerity".\n\nA harmless, inconsequential clerk wakes up one morning to find himself accused of something (he never discovers what).  Secret policemen enter his bedroom and subject him to a frightening interrogation in which every answer provokes a new line of questioning.  This is psychological torture, the mind's innate sense of justice constantly probing for some higher reference-point, some appeal to fairness, when in fact none exists.  Josef K returns repeatedly to the obvious question, "But what have I done?"  But there are no rules of justice here, no recourse to an autonomous code of law.  "You have the unmitigated gall to pretend you don't know?"\n\nA cry of anguish from the individual who finds himself overwhelmed by soulless bureaucracy, "The Trial" is a deeply personal statement by Welles, and as Higham puts it, "a symbol, if there ever was one, of his own career". Welles had been the enfant terrible whose erratic genius had alienated the big Hollywood studios.  Cut off from the big money, he was to spend the subsequent forty years globetrotting aimlessly, picking up work as best he could.\n\nAutobiographical elements of Kafka's own life, contained in "The Trial", are given prominence in the film.  Austria-Hungary launched World War One in the same year that Kafka began work on the novel.  Ironically, the limited war against Bosnia, intended to restore Austria's international credibility, turned into a conflagration bigger and more horrific than anything previously experienced on earth, and set in train the global violence which was to characterise the twentieth century.  It also destroyed Austria-Hungary.  Welles closes this story of 1914 with an image of nuclear catastrophe, stressing the oneness of the century's horror.  Kafka was bullied by his father, and reference is made in the course of the film to K's sense of filial guilt.  The office is depressing and demeaning, echoing Kafka's own experiences as a clerk in a bloated bureaucracy.\n\nThe State is remorseless and pitiless, grinding down and perverting even the strongest of human bonds, those of familial and sexual love.  K is forced to reject his little cousin Irmie (Maydra Shore), who has to remain 'outside'.  Later, an allegation of sexual impropriety concerning Irmie arises.  Any magnanimity towards another is interpreted by the authorities as a denunciation.  The torture scenes involving the secret policemen are the most disturbing part of the film, both because K realises how his own protests have borne poisoinous fruit, and because of the grinning obsequiousness of the victims.  The State turns its problems into spineless curs who acquiesce in their own degradation.\n\nNot only does K find himself becoming an accuser: he even assumes the role of interrogator, questioning Bloch and the Defendants.  Anyone who is not a keyholder within the pitiless apparatus of The State cannot help but take on its deadly pallor.  Keys are important.  Leni, the Court Guard and Zitorelli are empowered through possessing keys.  They are a corrupt priesthood in this cult of political disease.\n\nKafka's experiences with women were deeply ambivalent.  He had many intense relationships in his life, none of which proved satisfactory.  His book treats women as both temptresses and objects of loathing.  Welles follows this line, the women being desirable guide-figures and also deformed monstrosities.  The trunk-carrier, Lena and the hunchback girl all have bodily malformations.\n\nWelles shot most of the film in Zagreb, capturing strikingly the two clashing styles of architecture of Mittel-Europa, overblown ugly Habsburg baroque and drab communist functionalism.  It is as if the Prague of Mozart cannot help but decay into the Prague of Krushchev.  "Ostensibly free" is the best K can hope for, and 'ostensibly individual' is our optimum condition, as the shadows of the Stalinist apartment blocks crowd in on us.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20470,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1962-12-22","keywords":"dystopia,judicial system,surrealism,paranoia,kafka esque","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Trial","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2136456217","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUwOTExYmUtMmYwNi00NDA0LWFlNGUtZTA1NjI0Yzg1ZDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUwOTExYmUtMmYwNi00NDA0LWFlNGUtZTA1NjI0Yzg1ZDE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000578/","name":"Anthony Perkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0289450/","name":"Arnoldo Foà","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0353916/","name":"Jess Hahn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000080/","name":"Orson Welles"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057637/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086394/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017070/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0158971/","name":"Pierre Cholot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0434525/","name":"Franz Kafka","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000080/","name":"Orson Welles"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

we  have  lost the war.....","reviewBody":"...blame it on the "Quai des Brumes" !Both the right wing and the leftist reviews were chilly ,calling the movie " morbid" .Military censorship quickly banned "Le Jour se Lève" which was,if it were possible,even more depressing -and in my opinion even better,though at such a stratospheric level of art,this is minor quibble.\n\n"You do not blame a barometer which forecasts the storm" was Carné's famous answer.\n\n"Quai des Brumes" belongs to the legend of the French cinema.In a poll made around 1980,it was 8th best French film of all time (the number one,another Carné's masterpiece " Les Enfants Du Paradis" was a safe ,predictable choice ).More than the detective plot (there are many deaths in this film) ,the atmosphere of this misty harbor,with its ships about to sail away for these islands in the sun you'll never know ,is all that counts.It was the triumph of the Réalisme Poétique ,a label Carné himself did not like : these stories were poetic but they were not that much realistic,for they were filmed in studios ;masterpieces of cinema de studio of these golden years ,when the French were the best in the world : the harbor is unforgettable,as are the Canal Saint-Martin in "Hotel Du Nord" ,the metro station in "les Portes de la Nuit" or Le Boulevard Du Crime" in "Les Enfants Du Paradis".\n\nAfter an odd effort -which is today considered ahead of its time- " Drôle De Drame" , " Quai Des Brumes" is actually the follow-up to "Jenny" (1936).The gallery of sinister-looking persons was already present in Carné's first movie,and Françoise Rosay's last lines indicated that the relatively optimistic ending would mute .\n\n"Quai Des BRumes" leaves no hope to the viewer .This harbor which should mean freedom,escape is actually a blind alley ;nobody can escape.When Gabin appears in his shabby uniform and the gorgeous Michele Morgan in her raincoat and wearing her famous beret ,we know that their fate is already sealed.All the b.... around cannot understand true love .This is Carné's favorite subject: Michel Simon and Michèle Morgan are the prototype of the director's odd couple :see also Jules Berry and Jacqueline Laurent in "Le Jour Se Lève" or Pierre Brasseur and Nathalie Nattier in "Les Portes De La Nuit".\n\nExtraordinary scenes: Michel Simon,playing loud classical music which becomes "exotic" in such a rotten world.The same ,crying his heart out for love which he has never known "Nobody loves me!" ;Nelly and Jean on the harbor,exchanging Prevert's haunting lines " Every time the sun rises ,we hope something fresh will be born,but when it goes down,it the same old gloomy world" "The bottom of the sea is full of rubbish" ;the opening scenes ,with this truck running through a foggy country .\n\nAll the endings of Carné's movies of that era are mind-boggling:from the sun rising as the tragedy is complete ("Le Jour Se Lève") to the still beating hearts ("Les Visiteurs Du Soir"),from Baptiste lost in the crowd ("Les Enfants Du Paradis" ) to the stunning editing which concludes "Quai Des Brumes" : Jean,Nelly,the ship,the dog ,all this ,more than the other endings had a strong influence on more movies I can think of: Yves Allegret 's "Dédée D'Anvers ",Carol Reed's "Odd man out" -also influenced by Duvivier 's 'Pepe le Moko" are two prominent examples.\n\nWe may have lost the war...but we have gained another masterpiece by one of our greatest directors and one of our greatest writers.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"Not

we  have  lost the war.....","reviewBody":"...blame it on the "Quai des Brumes" !Both the right wing and the leftist reviews were chilly ,calling the movie " morbid" .Military censorship quickly banned "Le Jour se Lève" which was,if it were possible,even more depressing -and in my opinion even better,though at such a stratospheric level of art,this is minor quibble.\n\n"You do not blame a barometer which forecasts the storm" was Carné's famous answer.\n\n"Quai des Brumes" belongs to the legend of the French cinema.In a poll made around 1980,it was 8th best French film of all time (the number one,another Carné's masterpiece " Les Enfants Du Paradis" was a safe ,predictable choice ).More than the detective plot (there are many deaths in this film) ,the atmosphere of this misty harbor,with its ships about to sail away for these islands in the sun you'll never know ,is all that counts.It was the triumph of the Réalisme Poétique ,a label Carné himself did not like : these stories were poetic but they were not that much realistic,for they were filmed in studios ;masterpieces of cinema de studio of these golden years ,when the French were the best in the world : the harbor is unforgettable,as are the Canal Saint-Martin in "Hotel Du Nord" ,the metro station in "les Portes de la Nuit" or Le Boulevard Du Crime" in "Les Enfants Du Paradis".\n\nAfter an odd effort -which is today considered ahead of its time- " Drôle De Drame" , " Quai Des Brumes" is actually the follow-up to "Jenny" (1936).The gallery of sinister-looking persons was already present in Carné's first movie,and Françoise Rosay's last lines indicated that the relatively optimistic ending would mute .\n\n"Quai Des BRumes" leaves no hope to the viewer .This harbor which should mean freedom,escape is actually a blind alley ;nobody can escape.When Gabin appears in his shabby uniform and the gorgeous Michele Morgan in her raincoat and wearing her famous beret ,we know that their fate is already sealed.All the b.... around cannot understand true love .This is Carné's favorite subject: Michel Simon and Michèle Morgan are the prototype of the director's odd couple :see also Jules Berry and Jacqueline Laurent in "Le Jour Se Lève" or Pierre Brasseur and Nathalie Nattier in "Les Portes De La Nuit".\n\nExtraordinary scenes: Michel Simon,playing loud classical music which becomes "exotic" in such a rotten world.The same ,crying his heart out for love which he has never known "Nobody loves me!" ;Nelly and Jean on the harbor,exchanging Prevert's haunting lines " Every time the sun rises ,we hope something fresh will be born,but when it goes down,it the same old gloomy world" "The bottom of the sea is full of rubbish" ;the opening scenes ,with this truck running through a foggy country .\n\nAll the endings of Carné's movies of that era are mind-boggling:from the sun rising as the tragedy is complete ("Le Jour Se Lève") to the still beating hearts ("Les Visiteurs Du Soir"),from Baptiste lost in the crowd ("Les Enfants Du Paradis" ) to the stunning editing which concludes "Quai Des Brumes" : Jean,Nelly,the ship,the dog ,all this ,more than the other endings had a strong influence on more movies I can think of: Yves Allegret 's "Dédée D'Anvers ",Carol Reed's "Odd man out" -also influenced by Duvivier 's 'Pepe le Moko" are two prominent examples.\n\nWe may have lost the war...but we have gained another masterpiece by one of our greatest directors and one of our greatest writers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"Not

Not alive, anyway."","reviewBody":"Director Billy Wilder was certainly no stranger to the horrors of World War Two. He was born in Austria-Hungary {now Poland} in 1906, but moved to Berlin to begin a career in movies. However, following the rise of Adolf Hitler, Wilder  being Jewish  fled for Paris and then the United States. His mother, grandmother and stepfather died at the Auschwitz concentration camp. As such, I think it'd be safe to presume that Wilder housed a considerable hatred towards Nazis, which makes his POW-picture, 'Stalag 17 (1953),' all the more remarkable. Whereas the film might have developed into a bleak, depressing drama, the screenplay by Wilder and Edwin Blum {adapted from a play by Donald Bevan and Edmund Trzcinski} effortlessly blends drama and comedy, clearing the path for other similarly-themed war-time films {David Lean's 'The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)' and John Sturges' 'The Great Escape (1963)'} and even TV series {'Hogan's Heroes (1965-1971)' clearly used Wilder's film as a template  including an identical Sgt. Schulz  despite a failed court case in which producers sued for infringement}.\n\nThe year is 1944, in the week before Christmas. Stalag 17, a Nazi prisoner-of-war camp, is situated somewhere along the Danube River, and hundreds of captured Allied sergeants have been imprisoned there. The Americans of Barrack 4 endure a dull, deprived lifestyle, with each day consisting of unwholesome meals, tedious labour and uncomfortable living conditions. Displaying that typical American cleverness and resourcefulness, many of the prisoners have banded together to ensure themselves a few added luxuries  such a makeshift radio to listen to the latest war news  and to build an effective escape tunnel beneath the camp. However, it soon becomes apparent that there is a Nazi spy within their midst. After two escaping prisoners are immediately shot down, and their escape passage is inexplicably discovered, the men turn their suspicions towards J.J. Sefton (William Holden), a selfish and arrogant prisoner with a dog-eat-dog mentality that sees him openly bribing the German guards for luxuries. An unsympathetic character, one who nonetheless exhibits a certain streak of integrity, Sefton decides to uncover the true traitor of Barrack 4.\n\nThough he was reluctant to play such an unlikable character, Holden won the Best Actor Oscar for his powerful performance {via the second-shortest acceptance speech in Academy Awards history  a simple "thank you"}. The other actors in the film also create distinct and likable personalities, and I particularly enjoyed the big, oafish Animal (Robert Strauss) and Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck). Goodness knows what compelled the writers to make Sgt. Schulz (Sig Ruman), a loathsome tyrant in any other film, a jolly and hearty buffoon, but it works absolutely perfectly, his character's incompetence best highlighted in the sequence where he is distracted into playing volleyball, and enjoys the game so much that he hands his loaded weapon to the nearest POW. As Sefton attempts to uncover which fellow prisoner is leaving secret messages for their Nazis captors, Wilder intersperses the drama with an episodic flow of comedic situations, placing particularly emphasis on the means by which prisoners will alleviate their desire for the opposite sex. A hilarious sequence sees the drunken Animal mistaking his dressed-up bunk-mate for the cinema beauty Betty Grable, of whom he has an undying obsession.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1953-06-06","keywords":"prisoner of war camp,world war two,nazi,betting,diversionary tactic","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2917842969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjZkMGI5ZGEtYTNjYy00ZTQxLWFjZGEtMmRhNTljYmFiZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjZkMGI5ZGEtYTNjYy00ZTQxLWFjZGEtMmRhNTljYmFiZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000034/","name":"William Holden"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852279/","name":"Don Taylor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695937/","name":"Otto Preminger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089637/","name":"Edwin Blum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0079654/","name":"Donald Bevan"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Sefton (William Holden), a selfish and arrogant prisoner with a dog-eat-dog mentality that sees him openly bribing the German guards for luxuries. An unsympathetic character, one who nonetheless exhibits a certain streak of integrity, Sefton decides to uncover the true traitor of Barrack 4.\n\nThough he was reluctant to play such an unlikable character, Holden won the Best Actor Oscar for his powerful performance via the second-shortest acceptance speech in Academy Awards history  a simple "thank you". The other actors in the film also create distinct and likable personalities, and I particularly enjoyed the big, oafish Animal (Robert Strauss) and Shapiro (Harvey Lembeck). Goodness knows what compelled the writers to make Sgt. Schulz (Sig Ruman), a loathsome tyrant in any other film, a jolly and hearty buffoon, but it works absolutely perfectly, his character's incompetence best highlighted in the sequence where he is distracted into playing volleyball, and enjoys the game so much that he hands his loaded weapon to the nearest POW. As Sefton attempts to uncover which fellow prisoner is leaving secret messages for their Nazis captors, Wilder intersperses the drama with an episodic flow of comedic situations, placing particularly emphasis on the means by which prisoners will alleviate their desire for the opposite sex. A hilarious sequence sees the drunken Animal mistaking his dressed-up bunk-mate for the cinema beauty Betty Grable, of whom he has an undying obsession.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53925,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1953-06-06","keywords":"prisoner of war camp,world war two,nazi,betting,diversionary tactic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2917842969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjZkMGI5ZGEtYTNjYy00ZTQxLWFjZGEtMmRhNTljYmFiZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjZkMGI5ZGEtYTNjYy00ZTQxLWFjZGEtMmRhNTljYmFiZWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000034/","name":"William Holden","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852279/","name":"Don Taylor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695937/","name":"Otto Preminger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000697/","name":"Billy Wilder","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089637/","name":"Edwin Blum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0079654/","name":"Donald Bevan"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is entertaining if you are interested in how regular people with regular jobs would handle situations in France.

    <desc lang="fr">Portrait. Issu d'une famille d'intellectuels parisiens, Denis Gheerbrant se forme à l'IDHEC (maintenant rattaché à la Femis) en réalisation et prise de vue. En parallèle, il porte son regard partout où l'attire son appareil photo. Dès l'adolescence, il se sent " derrière une vitre " en compagnie des autres. C'est dans cette solitude qu'il trouve sa place, caméra à l'épaule, et commence à filmer la vie qui l'entoure, ses œuvres échappant aussi bien au genre du cinéma romanesque qu'au documentaire. Entre images et silences, il livre des bribes de réflexions sur le regard et les relations qui existent entre le sujet, le filmeur et sa caméra.</desc>

Coming along at a crossroads section in French fornication film history, with simulation rapidly rendered obsolete by full color penetration, Unia felt commercially compelled to retrieve his labor of love from domestic distribution at the eleventh hour, sprucing up its mildly naughty shenanigans with pornographic pickup shots, a common practice at this stage in the evolution of European erotic cinema. A similar fate befell his follow-up feature, LE PIED! a/k/a FLAT OUT, but at least this time around several of the original cast members (including Béatrice Harnois, Frédérique Barral and Pamela Stanford) stepped up to the plate to perform the "offensive" acts themselves. Realizing there was no way back, Unia embraced his new source of employment, churning out competently crafted carnal capers, albeit at a more reverential rate than his brethren in slime.\n\nCharacterized by both ecological concerns and an oddly protofeminist sensibility, allowing amorously autonomous heroines to challenge phallocratic patriarchy, his concise body of work was initially taken at face value by otherwise knowledgeable scribes as that of a female filmmaker, the anagrammatic "Reine Pirau" ! ESTELLE ET FLORA, with its devil may care eponymous erotic explorers, could serve as a prototype of the director's idiosyncratic approach, taken to Utopian extremes with B...COMME BEATRICE's harmonious matriarchal farming community. Subverting the myth of the rape of the Sabine women, L'ENLEVEMENT DES SABINES had a group of sexually disgruntled women joining forces against male egotism. Even though there's a price to pay for their defiance, a recurring turn of events throughout Unia's explicit endeavors, his female characters have the last word, obtaining vengeance both sophisticated and unexpected for the unbridled male violence inflicted upon them, a knee-jerk reaction towards their mates' challenging an increasingly antiquated status quo.\n\nAttempting to emulate EMMANUELLE's continued box office drawing power, with video rental and cable TV a reliable secondary source of income, Unia scheduled a brief return to real name respectability with a score of four tame trifles, all of which amazingly opened alongside Hollywood blockbusters at Paris first run theaters. Nobody's fool, the director made sure to shoot simultaneous - if sometimes substantially different - hardcore versions to maximize potential profits. Last as well as least of the lot, OUTRAGE AUX MOEURS approximates a cheapskate rendition of the already sordid if marginally popular (due in no small part to their pulp print source) BRIGADE MONDAINE skin-heavy "thrillers" searching to expose such tabloid-friendly subjects as white slavery and drug trafficking.\n\nThirtysomething movie mogul Claude Farrell ("Chris Garini" a/k/a porn performer Ghislain Garet, prominently featured in Gérard Kikoïne's NEVER ENOUGH) has the hots for aspiring actress Grendy Daumier (Valérie Houlier), star of his latest not-quite-porn blockbuster DORTOIR DES GRANDES - in reality, Unia's previous simulated opus COLLEGE DORMITORY - and at least a decade his junior. Unaware she's using him to further her career, with frequent trips to the tropical isle of St. Barts a pleasant bonus (not least in terms of production value), Claude receives the proverbial wake up call coming back from business earlier than expected to find Grendy giving it up to a lowly delivery guy. Shooting his rival for the unworthy tramp's affections, he goes on the lam, seeking refuge on a houseboat inhabited by another pair of cinema hopefuls, down to earth Chantal (Laetitia Thomas) and round-heeled Carla ("Ghislaine Kerdavid" a/k/a Michelle Davy, star of Michel Lemoine's LOVE IN PARADISE) who respond to Claude's disruptive presence in radically different ways. While Chantal seizes each opportunity to alert outsiders for help, Carla just comes on to him ! \n\nWhat little plot there is plays better as (albeit unintentional) comedy with wholly implausible situations - like Claude accompanying Chantal on a porn dubbing session since they both could do with the cash ?! - and some of the most wooden acting ever inflicted upon a paying audience. Ironically the sole cast member foregoing fornication film experience, totally talent-barren Houlier proves the prime offender with the fake tan sporting Garet a close contender. Frizzy-haired Thomas, who starred in Unia's simultaneously shot FESSES VIERGES A L'ESSAI AUX CARAIBES only to disappear without a trace, tries hard but is forced to face defeat by a belated change of heart turning her character into a complete moron. Ultimately, the delightful Davy comes off best, perpetually naked and wisely entrusted with most of the sex scenes. Stateside audiences may recall she starred (as "Nicole Vartan") in Jourdan Alexander's passable sequel TAXI GIRLS 2. Truncated orgy footage - check out FESSES VIERGES for the "inside scoop" ! - showcases a plethora of recognizable porn performers like mustachioed Jacky Arnal, incredible hunk Eric Saville, chunky Frank Balard, Karoline Houtart (the chubby-cheeked chick in a nun's habit also appearing in Michel Barny's AMOUR, FANTASMES ET FANTAISIE) plus a veritable who's who of Michel Lemoine cast-offs including Amanda Shell (FORBIDDEN PLEASURES), Chantal Trobert (MARILYN MON AMOUR) and Mina Houghe (HOT DESIRES).

I'm not a police man, not in Egypt, but still...this movie grabs you right in and makes you feel restless and worried, because everyone around you tries to play tricks on you, so who can you trust, if no one is trustworthy anymore?\n\nGo into that movie with an open mind, no expectations, just like I did and thank me later.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7631,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2017-07-05","keywords":"egypt,cairo egypt,egyptian police,2010s,police","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Nile Hilton Incident","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4229218073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA0NTU1MmEtMGE3ZS00ZmI5LWIyY2MtNGZkOWNmNjY0YmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA0NTU1MmEtMGE3ZS00ZmI5LWIyY2MtNGZkOWNmNjY0YmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267241/","name":"Fares Fares","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5080507/","name":"Mari Malek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5170525/","name":"Yasser Ali Maher"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757975/","name":"Tarik Saleh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0326635/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0122434/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0347482/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757975/","name":"Tarik Saleh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2549965/","name":"Magdi Abdelhadi"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But I kept grabbing my I-pad to something more interesting and/or exciting. The story and developments could have been done in 30 minutes. But alas, they did it in 90 minutes, leading to too little pace, too little jokes and scenes that do not matter. On the other hand, if you feel like a couch potato, like I did while watching, than it flows nicely, not expecting anything from you as a spectator. But if you do not see this one, you did not miss anything important.\n\nSo for you who are still interested the storyline: Jean-Jacques is a highly creative chef, but his imaginative duck rolls are not at all appreciated by his boss.

But I kept grabbing my I-pad to something more interesting and/or exciting. The story and developments could have been done in 30 minutes. But alas, they did it in 90 minutes, leading to too little pace, too little jokes and scenes that do not matter. On the other hand, if you feel like a couch potato, like I did while watching, than it flows nicely, not expecting anything from you as a spectator. But if you do not see this one, you did not miss anything important.\n\nSo for you who are still interested the storyline: Jean-Jacques is a highly creative chef, but his imaginative duck rolls are not at all appreciated by his boss. The time has come for him to leave his secure job behind and open his own restaurant... Claude is a instructor for corporate entrepreneurs, but he would prefer to be a writer. It's time for him to give it all up and finally write his novel...

Donald Sutherland was amazing, but as can be expected from him. Judi, like always is incredible at her role as Lady Catherine.\n\nIf you are a complete avid fan of the book as I am, you may or may not like it. My only complaint was that it was in fact short, but then again it is quite hard to make a 370+ page novel into a two hour movie easily. There is a phenomenal display of acting by the entire cast, and the score is perfect.\n\nOne warning though, the movie concentrates on the love story more than Austen's satire of society, so many Austen fans may be angry with that.

I thought he was fine, but believe me he is no Colin. Keira Knightley was absolutely incredible in the film, I would go as far to say it is her breakout performance. Donald Sutherland was amazing, but as can be expected from him. Judi, like always is incredible at her role as Lady Catherine.\n\nIf you are a complete avid fan of the book as I am, you may or may not like it. My only complaint was that it was in fact short, but then again it is quite hard to make a 370+ page novel into a two hour movie easily. There is a phenomenal display of acting by the entire cast, and the score is perfect.\n\nOne warning though, the movie concentrates on the love story more than Austen's satire of society, so many Austen fans may be angry with that. But overall I thought it was a great film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":267701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As he's hired to write the life of a famous football player, Kevin (Clovis Cornillac), he discovers that the latter's girlfriend is one of his old loves!

With his undetermined look, his inability to properly take a decision and assume it to the end, his awkward approach, Edouard Baer is a major asset for Tirard's film. He was the ideal man for this role unlike Claude Miller's versatile "Betty Fisher et Autres Histoires" (2001). And the direction of actors doesn't lie fallow. I was very taken with Marie-Josée Croze and the formidable sincerity she gave to her character Muriel. Clovis Cornillac is also well served with his football player Kevin who is as uncertain as Raphaël but on another basis. He doesn't know which style to confer to his biography!

Jean (Pio Marmaï) left his family home ten years ago. When father falls ill, he returns and reunites with his sister Juliette (Ana Girardot) and brother Jérémie (François Civil), to sort out stuff between them. Ah  families. Their problems and conflicts seem very important for themselves, but are often difficult to understand for bystanders. This is also true for writer-director Cédric Klapisch's latest, slow-burning but quite nice drama about the importance of family and the power of forgiving. The short summary feels sugary, and Klapisch does aim for feel-good, but the movie does not try to manipulate with audience in any tasteless way. It is actually realistic depiction of well-behaved and intelligent family's life, where everybody has their problems but these are not solved in overtly dramatic way often expected from family sagas. This subtle approach doesn't make for very engaging drama, but the feel-good factor is important part of the movie. If you care to invest yourself in these characters' lives, you will probably feel like a part of their group in their end. Which is the best thing this kind of movie can ask for. One can also learn quite a lot about making and appreciating wine. 113 minutes makes it rather long watch, it's not a standout work but quietly confident and satisfying. I don't like international and also Estonian title Back to Burgundy" (Tagasi Burgundiasse") which is not as eloquent as the original – directly translated What Links Us" (Mis meid seob").

Decent viewing.","reviewBody":"A heart wants what it wants. It's the end of the 1960's, and this solid family man (Colin Firth) wants to take his Sunday hobby of sailing to the ultimate level, designing his own boat and travelling around the world in six months - alone, as part of the contest.\n\nAlso starring, Rachel Weisz as the man's wife, David Thewlis, and, well, a whole lot of ocean. Based on a true story, by the way.\n\nThe central part of "The Mercy" is watching Firth's character Donald Crowhurst defying dangers and both physical and psychological hardships of sailing the ocean, having to rely only on his hands, wits and hope that nothing critical breaks down because the contest won't allow making stops or having breaks during the world travelling tour.\n\nA worn-down man sulking on a boat in the middle of nowhere might seem like a boring idea for a feature-length movie, but somehow the authors have managed to get it right, so it turns out to be quite a gripping.\n\nWhat was essentially a exhausting and monotonous journey where the main activities were shovelling out the water and trying to keep the whole thing from drowning, is enriched by portraying the gradual mental eroding of Crowhurst.\n\nColin Firth is known as versatile actor and you can bet your sweet bottom that he does a wonderful job at conveying the depression, loneliness, exhaustion and general distress of his character, so he is able to command our attention whenever he's on screen.\n\nAnd all that is his usual reserved and delicate way, living the character, not acting it.\n\nIt's easily an awards worthy performance although at this time it's way too early to predict his chances of getting an Oscar nomination.\n\nThe same goes, by the way, to Rachel Weisz who has created a a surprisingly soulful and charming supporting role from what surely must have been a mostly decorative one on paper.\n\nShe does not have much screen time actually, but it gets compensated by a powerful speech in the end. A true Oscar moment, as they would say.\n\nParallel to Crowhurst's journey, we see bits from the life of people who wait for his return, including the family - but also his promoter trying to earn him some money for the expensive trip that threatens to bankrupt the whole family.\n\nThis turns out to be the movie's weakness which, while not quite ruining the dramatic impact of the whole thing, does not actually expand or strengthen the main story in a meaningful way.\n\nIt's okay in short doses - if only for variety's sake - but its emotional "nutritive value" falls flat compared to what's happening on the sea.\n\nThe director James Marsh's previous project, "The Theory of Everything", suffers from the same deficiency. It's pretty and watchable but he should have trimmed the final act.\n\nThat's all I wanted to say about this one. "The Mercy" is pretty good but its shallower side holds it back a notch.

Decent viewing.","reviewBody":"A heart wants what it wants. It's the end of the 1960's, and this solid family man (Colin Firth) wants to take his Sunday hobby of sailing to the ultimate level, designing his own boat and travelling around the world in six months - alone, as part of the contest.\n\nAlso starring, Rachel Weisz as the man's wife, David Thewlis, and, well, a whole lot of ocean. Based on a true story, by the way.\n\nThe central part of "The Mercy" is watching Firth's character Donald Crowhurst defying dangers and both physical and psychological hardships of sailing the ocean, having to rely only on his hands, wits and hope that nothing critical breaks down because the contest won't allow making stops or having breaks during the world travelling tour.\n\nA worn-down man sulking on a boat in the middle of nowhere might seem like a boring idea for a feature-length movie, but somehow the authors have managed to get it right, so it turns out to be quite a gripping.\n\nWhat was essentially a exhausting and monotonous journey where the main activities were shovelling out the water and trying to keep the whole thing from drowning, is enriched by portraying the gradual mental eroding of Crowhurst.\n\nColin Firth is known as versatile actor and you can bet your sweet bottom that he does a wonderful job at conveying the depression, loneliness, exhaustion and general distress of his character, so he is able to command our attention whenever he's on screen.\n\nAnd all that is his usual reserved and delicate way, living the character, not acting it.\n\nIt's easily an awards worthy performance although at this time it's way too early to predict his chances of getting an Oscar nomination.\n\nThe same goes, by the way, to Rachel Weisz who has created a a surprisingly soulful and charming supporting role from what surely must have been a mostly decorative one on paper.\n\nShe does not have much screen time actually, but it gets compensated by a powerful speech in the end. A true Oscar moment, as they would say.\n\nParallel to Crowhurst's journey, we see bits from the life of people who wait for his return, including the family - but also his promoter trying to earn him some money for the expensive trip that threatens to bankrupt the whole family.\n\nThis turns out to be the movie's weakness which, while not quite ruining the dramatic impact of the whole thing, does not actually expand or strengthen the main story in a meaningful way.\n\nIt's okay in short doses - if only for variety's sake - but its emotional "nutritive value" falls flat compared to what's happening on the sea.\n\nThe director James Marsh's previous project, "The Theory of Everything", suffers from the same deficiency. It's pretty and watchable but he should have trimmed the final act.\n\nThat's all I wanted to say about this one. "The Mercy" is pretty good but its shallower side holds it back a notch. I am happy to have seen it but it will not linger on memory for long. Although I did like the deeper message that with grandiose plans comes a danger of falling into prison of one's own ego.\n\nWe have seen many instances of at least two similar-themed movies released in the same period of time. It also happens here, with "The Mercy" preceded by premiere of "Crowhurst" by almost five months, although the latter got a proper cinema release in the U.K. a few weeks later.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-11-28","keywords":"boat race,boat,sailing,lost at sea,period drama","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi297383961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4NGFjNjktYmFkNi00YTU5LWIyNDgtOTllZTk5NmE4OTY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4NGFjNjktYmFkNi00YTU5LWIyNDgtOTllZTk5NmE4OTY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjg2NjQwMDQ@._V1_.jpg","description":"Yachtsman Donald Crowhurst's disastrous attempt to win the 1968 Golden Globe Race ends up with him creating an outrageous account of traveling the world alone by sea.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5663632/","name":"Eleanor Stagg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001838/","name":"Rachel Weisz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016428/","name":"James Marsh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010002/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1994243/","name":"Scott Z.

My husband tends to reread it occasionally, and I myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind.  We have  videos of many of Redford s movies  and we have watched "A River runs through it" many times.  Redford is part of the "famdamily" as he is always around.   We never get tired of Redford's perception of Norman Maclean writings, and the beauty of Montana. The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. Maclean's father. According to "A River Runs Through It," "Methodists are Baptists who can read,"  a line which by the way is not in the short story,  but I think that is a funny line!  My husband and I are well-read Baptists!\n\nI have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow. I disagree.  As one search for inner peace, this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three/four rhythm of the metronome. The photography is outstanding! The acting is great.  I love the scene where Norman and Paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer! Then as adult Paul played by Brad Pitt (Se7ven)  is the  "perfect guy" who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it. The same applies to Neal Burns, who uses worms as bait, he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help. The scene where Paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace! Finally after hours, they all kneel around the table to say: "Grace!" and they all leave. But the oatmeal stayed on the plate! That scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors!  That is funny! The sunburn! The drive back home where Jessie Burns (Emily Lloyd) decides to go via the train line! Beautiful dialogue when Norman proposes to Jessie because he wants her to come to Chicago with him!\n\nRedford himself does a superb job as a narrator. I could not stop myself from comparing Brad to the young Redford (Barefoot in the Park). The nominated Director, Producer, Actor, is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the US but around the world. I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television, the movies and all the technology and special effects,  to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as Redford because I have had the chance to see his works. Redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of Montana in this masterpiece. The river to me means that line that separates life from death, memories and realities.

It's lazy. It means you have no clear direction and/or are trying to appear meaningful while being unable to resist inserting your own 'struggle' into the 'high concept'... as though you are equating yourself with the existential conflicts of gods and nature... I should think this is the penultimate epitome of pretentiousness and narcissism.\n\nYes, I got ALL the possible meanings of everything thrust into this amalgamation of horror and pseudo-philosophy tropes. And that was the problem... they were ALL THERE. There was no one idea prevailing; it was, as other reviewers noted, throwing all the poo against the wall and seeing what stuck... and the result was merely akin to a port-a-potty explosion.\n\nThe only reason I've given it a 2 was that there were so many abysmal movies this year that this one does rise a little higher by comparison... but only barely.\n\nThis is a movie for all the art-house crowd who believe their own self-delusions of brilliance and the Hollywood elite who pat themselves on the back ceaselessly.\n\nI would compare it to the absurdly high praise for "Boyhood".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":199006,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I think it's clear that Woody Allen hates cell phones because they get in the way of his stories.\n\nI would have suggested two important changes to the film. Have it take place 25 years earlier--1994 instead of 2019, before everyone had their own phone--and make the characters in their mid-30s instead of their early 20s.

Comparing it to Toy Story 3, a movie with a $200 million budget, is totally unfair.

I'm not sure I understand why a company like Disney, who once were the masters of imagination, uniqueness, &amp; fantasy, fail so miserably over these past 2 decades. Also, this film had approximately 1/4 of what "Deep Blue" had. If you want to watch a truly remarkable ocean film, see "Deep Blue", and pass over this one.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9492,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2010-01-27","keywords":"pufferfish,sea turtle,habitat,shark,marine life","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Oceans","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1646593049","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1OTEzNzY4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU1NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1OTEzNzY4Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU1NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An ecological drama/documentary, filmed throughout the globe.

When I learned of its existence, as a great lover of wolves, I rushed to order the DVD, which conveniently has English subtitles. I was not disappointed. Several wolves star in this film, along with the humans. Apart from the black wolf cub at the beginning, these wolves are not 'cute', and this is far from being a Walt Disney movie. This is gritty stuff. The lead is played by French/Corsican actress Letitia Casta, a beautiful creature who became a famous model as a teenager and is now a well-established film actress. She wants to be a veterinarian, and everyone scoffs at her about this, because it is the 1920s. (We are informed in a post credit that the first woman to become a vet in France obtained her qualifications in 1931.) But most of all, Casta wants to save the wild wolves in the foothills of the French Alps above her home town, which is on the border with Italy. In the 1920s, wild wolves still existed there, so this story is very authentic. But the wicked Jean-Paul Rouve wants to kill all the wolves and ruin the area for commercial development. Meanwhile, 'the madman', a wild young man called Giuseppe who is considered 'fou' by the locals, lives alone in a remote shack high up in the mountains where he keeps a donkey in his bedroom and has befriended a pack of wolves who hang around his door and are his only friends. The leader of the pack is the amazing black wolf whom he calls Carbone, whose eyes blaze from his black face like two searchlights. Casta and Giuseppe meet when he and Carbone jointly save her from freezing to death, and Carbone licks her face to revive her because he remembers her scent, as she is the one who saved him years before as an orphan cub. Having dislocated her leg, Casta has to remain for many days in Giuseppe's shack and gets to know him and realizes that he is a deeply sensitive and sympathetic soul. Indeed, Casta carried this realization beyond the screen, because she is now married to the actor who played Giuseppe, Stefano Accorsi, and has two children by him. The story is complex and cannot easily be summarised. Can Casta and Giuseppe together save the wolves, or will the forces of 'progress' win? There is a fascinating 34-minute 'making of' documentary on the DVD entitled BETWEEN MEN AND WOLVES. It has no English subtitles but is well worth watching regardless, as it reveals the incredible feats of the special effects men which were carried out on location in the snow, and above all it shows the work with the wolves and the tame eagle. Eagles are really terrifying if they attack, or even if they don't, frankly. They can kill any animal within seconds. The film features a scene where the eagle attacks a wolf cub and swoops just as the cub escapes into a hole in the rocks. Not long ago I came face to face with a wounded buzzard on the ground, and his vicious hissing and his savage beak as he faced me down and refused to retreat were pretty scary, but a buzzard is nothing compared to an eagle, being only about half the size. I hope I never 'scale up' and come face to face with a desperate eagle. In the documentary, we are informed that both French and American wolves were used, but there were many complaints about the American wolves being too wild and difficult to work with compared to the French ones, who were easier and had greater politesse, being French of course, and thus better mannered. At the end of the documentary, we are treated to scenes of the entire cast and crew howling like wolves. They freely admitted to getting very carried away by their wolfish friends during the filming and doing wolf howls became something they did regularly. Wolves are some of the most fascinating and gentle animals except when they are upset, and then watch out. There is one suckling scene with a female wolf nursing her cubs in a den. So the wolves are by no means just 'extras', they do have real acting roles in this film. This is a genuine, rather than a mawkish and superficial, film, and the director, cast and crew all deserve great praise for making it such a wonderful experience. It is suitable for families, unless parents are concerned at their children seeing a horse with an erection who attempts to mate with a mare, for as we know, farm life is very distant now from modern audiences, and there are some people who really believe that meat only exists when wrapped in plastic and who think that carrots grow on trees. This film is not only deeply satisfying but is an incredible achievement, considering how very difficult it was to get the wolves to make such excellent film debuts.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-02-13","keywords":"man in a wheelchair,modeling for a sculpture,veterinarian,mountain,following someone","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0144377/","name":"Laetitia Casta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009629/","name":"Stefano Accorsi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499448/","name":"Gilles Legrand"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033266/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190586/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0210997/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0181924/","name":"Jean Cosmos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499448/","name":"Gilles Legrand"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1356887/","name":"Philippe Vuaillat"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When I learned of its existence, as a great lover of wolves, I rushed to order the DVD, which conveniently has English subtitles. I was not disappointed. Several wolves star in this film, along with the humans. Apart from the black wolf cub at the beginning, these wolves are not 'cute', and this is far from being a Walt Disney movie. This is gritty stuff. The lead is played by French/Corsican actress Letitia Casta, a beautiful creature who became a famous model as a teenager and is now a well-established film actress. She wants to be a veterinarian, and everyone scoffs at her about this, because it is the 1920s. (We are informed in a post credit that the first woman to become a vet in France obtained her qualifications in 1931.) But most of all, Casta wants to save the wild wolves in the foothills of the French Alps above her home town, which is on the border with Italy. In the 1920s, wild wolves still existed there, so this story is very authentic. But the wicked Jean-Paul Rouve wants to kill all the wolves and ruin the area for commercial development. Meanwhile, 'the madman', a wild young man called Giuseppe who is considered 'fou' by the locals, lives alone in a remote shack high up in the mountains where he keeps a donkey in his bedroom and has befriended a pack of wolves who hang around his door and are his only friends. The leader of the pack is the amazing black wolf whom he calls Carbone, whose eyes blaze from his black face like two searchlights. Casta and Giuseppe meet when he and Carbone jointly save her from freezing to death, and Carbone licks her face to revive her because he remembers her scent, as she is the one who saved him years before as an orphan cub. Having dislocated her leg, Casta has to remain for many days in Giuseppe's shack and gets to know him and realizes that he is a deeply sensitive and sympathetic soul. Indeed, Casta carried this realization beyond the screen, because she is now married to the actor who played Giuseppe, Stefano Accorsi, and has two children by him. The story is complex and cannot easily be summarised. Can Casta and Giuseppe together save the wolves, or will the forces of 'progress' win? There is a fascinating 34-minute 'making of' documentary on the DVD entitled BETWEEN MEN AND WOLVES. It has no English subtitles but is well worth watching regardless, as it reveals the incredible feats of the special effects men which were carried out on location in the snow, and above all it shows the work with the wolves and the tame eagle. Eagles are really terrifying if they attack, or even if they don't, frankly. They can kill any animal within seconds. The film features a scene where the eagle attacks a wolf cub and swoops just as the cub escapes into a hole in the rocks. Not long ago I came face to face with a wounded buzzard on the ground, and his vicious hissing and his savage beak as he faced me down and refused to retreat were pretty scary, but a buzzard is nothing compared to an eagle, being only about half the size. I hope I never 'scale up' and come face to face with a desperate eagle. In the documentary, we are informed that both French and American wolves were used, but there were many complaints about the American wolves being too wild and difficult to work with compared to the French ones, who were easier and had greater politesse, being French of course, and thus better mannered. At the end of the documentary, we are treated to scenes of the entire cast and crew howling like wolves. They freely admitted to getting very carried away by their wolfish friends during the filming and doing wolf howls became something they did regularly. Wolves are some of the most fascinating and gentle animals except when they are upset, and then watch out. There is one suckling scene with a female wolf nursing her cubs in a den. So the wolves are by no means just 'extras', they do have real acting roles in this film. This is a genuine, rather than a mawkish and superficial, film, and the director, cast and crew all deserve great praise for making it such a wonderful experience. It is suitable for families, unless parents are concerned at their children seeing a horse with an erection who attempts to mate with a mare, for as we know, farm life is very distant now from modern audiences, and there are some people who really believe that meat only exists when wrapped in plastic and who think that carrots grow on trees. This film is not only deeply satisfying but is an incredible achievement, considering how very difficult it was to get the wolves to make such excellent film debuts.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-02-13","keywords":"man in a wheelchair,modeling for a sculpture,veterinarian,mountain,following someone","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0144377/","name":"Laetitia Casta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009629/","name":"Stefano Accorsi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499448/","name":"Gilles Legrand"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033266/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0210997/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0181924/","name":"Jean Cosmos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499448/","name":"Gilles Legrand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1356887/","name":"Philippe Vuaillat"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I do have to admit that I am an Adam Sandler fan. Being 21, I grew up seeing his films in theaters and for the most part liked them all. I think with Big Daddy, Dennis Dugan and Adam Sandler's Happy Madison crew really started a formula of movie. Central conflicted and imperfect character Adam (who has a good heart of course), falls in love with the girl of his dreams, who is younger and way better looking than him, all formulated around a specific central premise (i.e. with this film it's Adam's lies piling on top of lies) supported by extremely strong, quirky side character performances. This might be the epitome of this established formula, really passing 50 First Dates in my opinion. The typical Sandler ridiculous humor and smart-ass remarks are extremely well balanced with perfectly timed and executed emotional moments. The set-up for the story is pretty basic and at first almost appears predictable. It is to some extent, but the crazy directions the movie takes based on Sandler's lies is well done and only stretches a few times. But what do you expect from the Happy Madison crew? \n\nThe 2 kids in the film did a good job and had some funny lines. I am not a Jennifer Aniston fan at all but really actually liked her in this. I sort of understand her popularity and charm after this movie. She seemed more genuine and I felt an emotional attachment to her that I have always lacked with her. Plus, she is showcased in a particular waterfall scene and looks absolutely fantastic in a bikini. Brooklyn Decker is unbelievably gorgeous, as we all know from the SI Swimsuit Edition, but I was very surprised at how natural of an actress she was. She seemed very comfortable and didn't overact much. She is extremely cute and lovable. Nicole Kidman and Dave Mathews were great as an uber cool couple. Nicole was a bit over the top as she has been of late (like since Moulin Rouge), but thats what her character called for so I understand. Dave was surprisingly good as an almost drugged up yuppie, cool boyfriend of Nicole's. Nick Swardson was absolutely hilarious and by far steals every scene he is in. He really comes into the movie about 1/3 of the way in and from there on out its his movie. Nick Swardson deserves fame for this.\n\nI can't say for sure how the critics will receive it. I can handle suspension of disbelief as long as it leads to a funny payoff. For the most part these moments are delivered. It's a great date movie and a great movie for Sandler fans. He has an unbelievable recent track record for success, but this will top all of them at the box office."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":226814,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When I learned of its existence, as a great lover of wolves, I rushed to order the DVD, which conveniently has English subtitles. I was not disappointed. Several wolves star in this film, along with the humans. Apart from the black wolf cub at the beginning, these wolves are not 'cute', and this is far from being a Walt Disney movie. This is gritty stuff. The lead is played by French/Corsican actress Letitia Casta, a beautiful creature who became a famous model as a teenager and is now a well-established film actress. She wants to be a veterinarian, and everyone scoffs at her about this, because it is the 1920s. (We are informed in a post credit that the first woman to become a vet in France obtained her qualifications in 1931.) But most of all, Casta wants to save the wild wolves in the foothills of the French Alps above her home town, which is on the border with Italy. In the 1920s, wild wolves still existed there, so this story is very authentic. But the wicked Jean-Paul Rouve wants to kill all the wolves and ruin the area for commercial development. Meanwhile, 'the madman', a wild young man called Giuseppe who is considered 'fou' by the locals, lives alone in a remote shack high up in the mountains where he keeps a donkey in his bedroom and has befriended a pack of wolves who hang around his door and are his only friends. The leader of the pack is the amazing black wolf whom he calls Carbone, whose eyes blaze from his black face like two searchlights. Casta and Giuseppe meet when he and Carbone jointly save her from freezing to death, and Carbone licks her face to revive her because he remembers her scent, as she is the one who saved him years before as an orphan cub. Having dislocated her leg, Casta has to remain for many days in Giuseppe's shack and gets to know him and realizes that he is a deeply sensitive and sympathetic soul. Indeed, Casta carried this realization beyond the screen, because she is now married to the actor who played Giuseppe, Stefano Accorsi, and has two children by him. The story is complex and cannot easily be summarised. Can Casta and Giuseppe together save the wolves, or will the forces of 'progress' win? There is a fascinating 34-minute 'making of' documentary on the DVD entitled BETWEEN MEN AND WOLVES. It has no English subtitles but is well worth watching regardless, as it reveals the incredible feats of the special effects men which were carried out on location in the snow, and above all it shows the work with the wolves and the tame eagle. Eagles are really terrifying if they attack, or even if they don't, frankly. They can kill any animal within seconds. The film features a scene where the eagle attacks a wolf cub and swoops just as the cub escapes into a hole in the rocks. Not long ago I came face to face with a wounded buzzard on the ground, and his vicious hissing and his savage beak as he faced me down and refused to retreat were pretty scary, but a buzzard is nothing compared to an eagle, being only about half the size. I hope I never 'scale up' and come face to face with a desperate eagle. In the documentary, we are informed that both French and American wolves were used, but there were many complaints about the American wolves being too wild and difficult to work with compared to the French ones, who were easier and had greater politesse, being French of course, and thus better mannered. At the end of the documentary, we are treated to scenes of the entire cast and crew howling like wolves. They freely admitted to getting very carried away by their wolfish friends during the filming and doing wolf howls became something they did regularly. Wolves are some of the most fascinating and gentle animals except when they are upset, and then watch out. There is one suckling scene with a female wolf nursing her cubs in a den. So the wolves are by no means just 'extras', they do have real acting roles in this film. This is a genuine, rather than a mawkish and superficial, film, and the director, cast and crew all deserve great praise for making it such a wonderful experience. It is suitable for families, unless parents are concerned at their children seeing a horse with an erection who attempts to mate with a mare, for as we know, farm life is very distant now from modern audiences, and there are some people who really believe that meat only exists when wrapped in plastic and who think that carrots grow on trees. This film is not only deeply satisfying but is an incredible achievement, considering how very difficult it was to get the wolves to make such excellent film debuts.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-02-13","keywords":"man in a wheelchair,modeling for a sculpture,veterinarian,mountain,following someone","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0144377/","name":"Laetitia Casta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009629/","name":"Stefano Accorsi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499448/","name":"Gilles Legrand"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033266/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190586/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0210997/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0181924/","name":"Jean Cosmos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499448/","name":"Gilles Legrand"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1356887/","name":"Philippe Vuaillat"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

When I learned of its existence, as a great lover of wolves, I rushed to order the DVD, which conveniently has English subtitles. I was not disappointed. Several wolves star in this film, along with the humans. Apart from the black wolf cub at the beginning, these wolves are not 'cute', and this is far from being a Walt Disney movie. This is gritty stuff. The lead is played by French/Corsican actress Letitia Casta, a beautiful creature who became a famous model as a teenager and is now a well-established film actress. She wants to be a veterinarian, and everyone scoffs at her about this, because it is the 1920s. (We are informed in a post credit that the first woman to become a vet in France obtained her qualifications in 1931.) But most of all, Casta wants to save the wild wolves in the foothills of the French Alps above her home town, which is on the border with Italy. In the 1920s, wild wolves still existed there, so this story is very authentic. But the wicked Jean-Paul Rouve wants to kill all the wolves and ruin the area for commercial development. Meanwhile, 'the madman', a wild young man called Giuseppe who is considered 'fou' by the locals, lives alone in a remote shack high up in the mountains where he keeps a donkey in his bedroom and has befriended a pack of wolves who hang around his door and are his only friends. The leader of the pack is the amazing black wolf whom he calls Carbone, whose eyes blaze from his black face like two searchlights. Casta and Giuseppe meet when he and Carbone jointly save her from freezing to death, and Carbone licks her face to revive her because he remembers her scent, as she is the one who saved him years before as an orphan cub. Having dislocated her leg, Casta has to remain for many days in Giuseppe's shack and gets to know him and realizes that he is a deeply sensitive and sympathetic soul. Indeed, Casta carried this realization beyond the screen, because she is now married to the actor who played Giuseppe, Stefano Accorsi, and has two children by him. The story is complex and cannot easily be summarised. Can Casta and Giuseppe together save the wolves, or will the forces of 'progress' win? There is a fascinating 34-minute 'making of' documentary on the DVD entitled BETWEEN MEN AND WOLVES. It has no English subtitles but is well worth watching regardless, as it reveals the incredible feats of the special effects men which were carried out on location in the snow, and above all it shows the work with the wolves and the tame eagle. Eagles are really terrifying if they attack, or even if they don't, frankly. They can kill any animal within seconds. The film features a scene where the eagle attacks a wolf cub and swoops just as the cub escapes into a hole in the rocks. Not long ago I came face to face with a wounded buzzard on the ground, and his vicious hissing and his savage beak as he faced me down and refused to retreat were pretty scary, but a buzzard is nothing compared to an eagle, being only about half the size. I hope I never 'scale up' and come face to face with a desperate eagle. In the documentary, we are informed that both French and American wolves were used, but there were many complaints about the American wolves being too wild and difficult to work with compared to the French ones, who were easier and had greater politesse, being French of course, and thus better mannered. At the end of the documentary, we are treated to scenes of the entire cast and crew howling like wolves. They freely admitted to getting very carried away by their wolfish friends during the filming and doing wolf howls became something they did regularly. Wolves are some of the most fascinating and gentle animals except when they are upset, and then watch out. There is one suckling scene with a female wolf nursing her cubs in a den. So the wolves are by no means just 'extras', they do have real acting roles in this film. This is a genuine, rather than a mawkish and superficial, film, and the director, cast and crew all deserve great praise for making it such a wonderful experience. It is suitable for families, unless parents are concerned at their children seeing a horse with an erection who attempts to mate with a mare, for as we know, farm life is very distant now from modern audiences, and there are some people who really believe that meat only exists when wrapped in plastic and who think that carrots grow on trees. This film is not only deeply satisfying but is an incredible achievement, considering how very difficult it was to get the wolves to make such excellent film debuts.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-02-13","keywords":"man in a wheelchair,modeling for a sculpture,veterinarian,mountain,following someone","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0144377/","name":"Laetitia Casta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009629/","name":"Stefano Accorsi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499448/","name":"Gilles Legrand"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033266/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0210997/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0181924/","name":"Jean Cosmos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499448/","name":"Gilles Legrand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1356887/","name":"Philippe Vuaillat"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A great start for Sony Pictures Animation!","reviewBody":"What's a 'unihorn' you may ask? Well, it's a deer that only has one antler, of course. And you'll only see one in the new Sony Pictures Animation film, Open Season, starring Martin Lawrence, Debra Messing, Ashton Kutcher, Gary Sinise, Jon Favreau, and many more.\n\nMartin voices the lovable Boog in the film; he's the main attraction of a show at the zoo with his best friend, Beth (Debra Messing). Boog also lives with Beth, equipped with his stuffed animal, Dunkleman. On a completely side note, what would a Sony film be without a reference to one of their own. Before Boog settles in for his comfy night sleep, he checks out Pat Sajak on Wheel of Fortune.\n\nThey have a great life together doing shows for the fans, even exchanging powerful roars. But that's before Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) shows up, the hapless one-antlered deer who's been captured by the evil Shaw (Gary Sinise). Boog helps Elliot escape and makes Boog's and Beth's life miserable, forcing Beth to send the two animals away into the forest.\n\nOn his own for the first time, Boog now has to rely on himself, or be stuck with Elliot. And that means figuring out how to go to the bathroom in the wild. That's when he first runs into McSquizzy, the squirrel (voiced by Billy Connolly)  McSquizzy is the ruler of the forest trees, and has a great and powerful squirrel Army to back him up, equipped with thousand of acorns. Without a doubt, McSquizzy is one of the highlights of Open Season! He's got wit, humor, and a ton of Scottish charm.\n\nBoog realizes having Elliot around is the only way he'll get back to Beth. So they become 'partners,' much to the dismay of Boog  but the delight of Elliot, who just needs a friend. With hunting season right around the corner, the two must work together to sneak around the hunters.\n\nBut when Shaw breaks the hunting season date, the animals switch their thinking  instead of running away, they're going to fight back! And fight back they do! Trying to run away, Boog crosses a dam; unfortunately, his 900 pound body crumbles the wood.\n\nThat's when Open Season turns into Hill Street Blues! There is one of the most amazing chase scenes I've ever seen in the movies. Boog, Elliot, and their porcupine friend try and escape the gun shots of Shaw  but on water. Bobbing and weaving through the water, under water, above water, around rocks  great scene! There's even a waterfall at the end to top it off! I have somewhat of a test for animated movies I've been giving myself over the past few years  ever since seeing the water scenes in The Incredibles, and noticing how real it looked, I've started to take an eye to the screen. If water doesn't look real, than it doesn't pass the test. Let's just say, Open Season aced my test. This water chase scene goes on for about 5 minutes, maybe a little more; but it's so exciting and amazing to watch! It's not just the water of Open Season, it's the entire field of animation; the animals really come alive on the screen. I'm a huge fan of animation; I think it has to do with the fact that anything done with computer fascinates me. The detailed description of each character, from their eyes, nose, mouth, walk, and hair  and in this movie, fur; it's just so amazing! But back to the story - after meeting back up with the group of beavers, led by Reilly (voiced by Jon Favreau), some of Elliot's former deer mates (Patrick Warburton and Jane Krakowski), and a few other animals, Boog and Elliot team up and go on the attack against the hunters. Bras, plungers, grills, forks, knives, spoons, and basically, anything they can get their hands on  sorry, whatever they can get their paws on  they use to charge the hunters with.\n\nOpen Season is directed by Jill Culton, Roger Allers, and Tony Stacchi; each has a number of major credits to their name. Both Tony and Jill make their feature directorial debut on this film; however, Jill has worked at Pixar on the character development for Monsters Inc. and Toy Story. Tony worked on a number of films for ILM including Hook and Ghost. Roger Allers co-directed The Lion King, and has just recently completed The Little Match Girl  a short attached to The Little Mermaid.\n\nOpen Season is a fun and very enjoyable film for kids and families. It's definitely a film you'll be talking about for a long time. And don't forget, you can also check out the film in IMAX 3D, opening at major theaters across the country.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89010,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A great start for Sony Pictures Animation!","reviewBody":"What's a 'unihorn' you may ask? Well, it's a deer that only has one antler, of course. And you'll only see one in the new Sony Pictures Animation film, Open Season, starring Martin Lawrence, Debra Messing, Ashton Kutcher, Gary Sinise, Jon Favreau, and many more.\n\nMartin voices the lovable Boog in the film; he's the main attraction of a show at the zoo with his best friend, Beth (Debra Messing). Boog also lives with Beth, equipped with his stuffed animal, Dunkleman. On a completely side note, what would a Sony film be without a reference to one of their own. Before Boog settles in for his comfy night sleep, he checks out Pat Sajak on Wheel of Fortune.\n\nThey have a great life together doing shows for the fans, even exchanging powerful roars. But that's before Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) shows up, the hapless one-antlered deer who's been captured by the evil Shaw (Gary Sinise). Boog helps Elliot escape and makes Boog's and Beth's life miserable, forcing Beth to send the two animals away into the forest.\n\nOn his own for the first time, Boog now has to rely on himself, or be stuck with Elliot. And that means figuring out how to go to the bathroom in the wild. That's when he first runs into McSquizzy, the squirrel (voiced by Billy Connolly)  McSquizzy is the ruler of the forest trees, and has a great and powerful squirrel Army to back him up, equipped with thousand of acorns. Without a doubt, McSquizzy is one of the highlights of Open Season! He's got wit, humor, and a ton of Scottish charm.\n\nBoog realizes having Elliot around is the only way he'll get back to Beth. So they become 'partners,' much to the dismay of Boog  but the delight of Elliot, who just needs a friend. With hunting season right around the corner, the two must work together to sneak around the hunters.\n\nBut when Shaw breaks the hunting season date, the animals switch their thinking  instead of running away, they're going to fight back! And fight back they do! Trying to run away, Boog crosses a dam; unfortunately, his 900 pound body crumbles the wood.\n\nThat's when Open Season turns into Hill Street Blues! There is one of the most amazing chase scenes I've ever seen in the movies. Boog, Elliot, and their porcupine friend try and escape the gun shots of Shaw  but on water. Bobbing and weaving through the water, under water, above water, around rocks  great scene! There's even a waterfall at the end to top it off! I have somewhat of a test for animated movies I've been giving myself over the past few years  ever since seeing the water scenes in The Incredibles, and noticing how real it looked, I've started to take an eye to the screen. If water doesn't look real, than it doesn't pass the test. Let's just say, Open Season aced my test. This water chase scene goes on for about 5 minutes, maybe a little more; but it's so exciting and amazing to watch! It's not just the water of Open Season, it's the entire field of animation; the animals really come alive on the screen. I'm a huge fan of animation; I think it has to do with the fact that anything done with computer fascinates me. The detailed description of each character, from their eyes, nose, mouth, walk, and hair  and in this movie, fur; it's just so amazing! But back to the story - after meeting back up with the group of beavers, led by Reilly (voiced by Jon Favreau), some of Elliot's former deer mates (Patrick Warburton and Jane Krakowski), and a few other animals, Boog and Elliot team up and go on the attack against the hunters. Bras, plungers, grills, forks, knives, spoons, and basically, anything they can get their hands on  sorry, whatever they can get their paws on  they use to charge the hunters with.\n\nOpen Season is directed by Jill Culton, Roger Allers, and Tony Stacchi; each has a number of major credits to their name. Both Tony and Jill make their feature directorial debut on this film; however, Jill has worked at Pixar on the character development for Monsters Inc. and Toy Story. Tony worked on a number of films for ILM including Hook and Ghost. Roger Allers co-directed The Lion King, and has just recently completed The Little Match Girl  a short attached to The Little Mermaid.\n\nOpen Season is a fun and very enjoyable film for kids and families. It's definitely a film you'll be talking about for a long time. And don't forget, you can also check out the film in IMAX 3D, opening at major theaters across the country.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89010,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As its title indicates, the town of Versailles constitutes the backdrop of the plot and Denis Podalydès acts a timid young man who invited Claire in his flat as big as a pocket handkerchief. He prepares himself so that the evening will end in a tender conclusion. Unfortunately, an unforeseen detail and the burdensome intrusion of his neighbors and friends will shatter his evening and spoil the pleasure he would have liked to take with his girlfriend.\n\nRarely has a comedy contained so much laughter in a so restrained lapse of time and a so cramped place. The Podalydès brothers (Denis in front of the camera, Bruno behind it) teamed up to produce a little treasure. Indisputably, it is a reliable model of French comedy made with little means but with much brilliance and panache. The one single gag of the film finds itself in the beginning of the work. It could have been fallen in the bad taste but it's not in the habits of Bruno Podalydès to shot this kind of thing. He prefers to film it with a sense of decency and reserve. However, this gag will launch a series of unpredictable sudden new developments galore which will follow on from each other through a mad and implacable logic.\n\nIt's not all. On a screenplay set with clockwork precision, Bruno Podalydès has fun of the most well-worn stereotypes and has the capacity to make dense a trite situation. And if this situation may appear as disagreeable for poor Arnaud, he has fun of it and makes the viewer laugh at it. And where Podalydès is very good at is to turn the possible weaknesses of his work into strengths. Indeed, some jerry-built sequences will be followed by masterful comical sudden new developments. For example, in the beginning Claire wants to go to the toilets but the toilet flush doesn't work and Arnaud says that his brother is in the toilets. Then, while Claire's back is turned, he calls his brother to rescue him and explain him the situation. As for the sequel, go and see for yourself.\n\nBut Bruno Podalydès has more than one string to his bow. He also achieves the incredible feat to boost the machine again when it seems to be out of breath (see the sequence with the arrival of the musicians).\n\n"Versailles Rive Gauche" includes virtually all the seeds the Podalydès brothers will use in their subsequent works. Apart their own comical approach (a minimum of gags for a maximum of sudden new developments, to gently laugh at an annoying situation for a character), they will hire the same actors in often little but always noteworthy roles. One doesn't change a winning team with comedians like Philippe Uchan or Michel Vuillermoz who seem here to take a great pleasure to act their respective roles. And Podalydès's opus is also filled with nods and allusions to Tintin, one of the brothers' icons.\n\nIf you have the chance to watch this jewel and it's not easy given it isn't very known among the French mainstream, don't think twice. And if you can , try to watch the other works I mentioned.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":264,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1992-06-17","keywords":"brushing teeth,drunkenness,small apartment,vomiting,dinner guest","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687914/","name":"Denis Podalydès"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0133713/","name":"Isabelle Candelier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0399576/","name":"Philippe Uchan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687913/","name":"Bruno Podalydès"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106832/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687913/","name":"Bruno Podalydès"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687914/","name":"Denis Podalydès"}],"duration":"PT45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's only a pity that his performance is sometimes on the verge of third-rate acting.\n\nSo, "Liberté-Oléron" in spite of its weaknesses constitutes a real moment of happiness and the Podalydès brothers are people to follow in French cinema.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-06-20","keywords":"male nudity,male frontal nudity,male rear nudity,male full frontal nudity,vacation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687914/","name":"Denis Podalydès","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0518653/","name":"Guilaine Londez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684001/","name":"Patrick Pineau"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687913/","name":"Bruno Podalydès"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022244/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687913/","name":"Bruno Podalydès","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687914/","name":"Denis Podalydès"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The plot is rather simple: a French special forces unit (the movie is French/French-produced) is sent in to rescue a journalist from Afghanistan who has been captured by a Taliban warlord. Right off the bat, you are introduced to the principal characters, but not much is given in the way of character development or making the audience care, aside from some small character moments interspersed throughout the latter half of the film. The performances are adequate, with the best being given by Diane Kruger (as the journalist) and Djimon Hounsou (one of the special forces guys). The actor who portrays the Taliban warlord also does a good job, probably adding some depth to his character by having him be Western-educated and somewhat caught between Western culture and his own culture and beliefs, but not much attention is paid to his character either. It also doesn't help that his demise later in the film is done so haphazardly and unceremoniously. As far as the combat sequences go, they were fine and done in current "en vogue" style of somewhat shaky "cinema verite" realism to give a sense of the chaos of battle. The violence was effective and not gratuitous in any way. However, towards the end the movie drags a little bit as we're shown day after day passing of the core group trying to get away from their pursuers and safely back into Afghanistan (they've been wandering around in the Pakistani desert for most of the movie). Overall, the movie is effective in the combat sequences and showing how the special forces team bond with the people they try to rescue. Over the course of the film, you do grow to care a little bit more about the characters but not because you feel like you really know them, just because you empathize with the sticky situation they're in. The movie aspires to be SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (made by the French, and set during the Afghan war), but it falls short of the mark. Still, it makes for a somewhat entertaining, slightly taxing, viewing experience.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18373,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2011-11-02","keywords":"mountain pass,stitching a wound,scene after end credits,chase,two word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2752297753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM2OTFkMTMtZWYxNC00Y2NkLTgzYmUtOTI3MDJkOTNiOGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM2OTFkMTMtZWYxNC00Y2NkLTgzYmUtOTI3MDJkOTNiOGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1208167/","name":"Diane Kruger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005023/","name":"Djimon Hounsou"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536095/","name":"Benoît Magimel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1360702/","name":"Stéphane Rybojad"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0304607/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1360702/","name":"Stéphane Rybojad"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0178264/","name":"Michael Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4389075/","name":"Emmanuelle Collomp"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The plot is rather simple: a French special forces unit (the movie is French/French-produced) is sent in to rescue a journalist from Afghanistan who has been captured by a Taliban warlord. Right off the bat, you are introduced to the principal characters, but not much is given in the way of character development or making the audience care, aside from some small character moments interspersed throughout the latter half of the film. The performances are adequate, with the best being given by Diane Kruger (as the journalist) and Djimon Hounsou (one of the special forces guys). The actor who portrays the Taliban warlord also does a good job, probably adding some depth to his character by having him be Western-educated and somewhat caught between Western culture and his own culture and beliefs, but not much attention is paid to his character either. It also doesn't help that his demise later in the film is done so haphazardly and unceremoniously. As far as the combat sequences go, they were fine and done in current "en vogue" style of somewhat shaky "cinema verite" realism to give a sense of the chaos of battle. The violence was effective and not gratuitous in any way. However, towards the end the movie drags a little bit as we're shown day after day passing of the core group trying to get away from their pursuers and safely back into Afghanistan (they've been wandering around in the Pakistani desert for most of the movie). Overall, the movie is effective in the combat sequences and showing how the special forces team bond with the people they try to rescue. Over the course of the film, you do grow to care a little bit more about the characters but not because you feel like you really know them, just because you empathize with the sticky situation they're in. The movie aspires to be SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (made by the French, and set during the Afghan war), but it falls short of the mark. Still, it makes for a somewhat entertaining, slightly taxing, viewing experience.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18373,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2011-11-02","keywords":"mountain pass,stitching a wound,scene after end credits,chase,two word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2752297753","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM2OTFkMTMtZWYxNC00Y2NkLTgzYmUtOTI3MDJkOTNiOGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM2OTFkMTMtZWYxNC00Y2NkLTgzYmUtOTI3MDJkOTNiOGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1208167/","name":"Diane Kruger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005023/","name":"Djimon Hounsou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536095/","name":"Benoît Magimel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1360702/","name":"Stéphane Rybojad"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0304607/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1360702/","name":"Stéphane Rybojad","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0178264/","name":"Michael Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4389075/","name":"Emmanuelle Collomp"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Seriously, two of the reviews on this site made spedific mention of Schlöndorff's "horrible", "atrocious" directorial skills.  Ahem.  Perhaps before they weigh in on the auteur, they ought to see "Young Törless", "Coup de grâce", "The Tin Drum" and all of his other wonderful efforts.  As a matter of fact, to insinuate that someone who could bring Grass' Tin Drum to the screen in such a stunning fashion is a lousy director is PREPOSTEROUS.  Schlöndorff is a giant of the New German Cinema, and it underscores the ignorance of the Hollywooders when they cast such baseless aspersions.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9319,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1990-02-15","keywords":"fundamentalist religion,dystopia,pantyhose,impregnation,totalitarian state","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Handmaid's Tale","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1673183001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBiMWJjNmUtMDY4MS00ZDEyLWI4NzItOWQwNTJkMmUzYmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDBiMWJjNmUtMDY4MS00ZDEyLWI4NzItOWQwNTJkMmUzYmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001670/","name":"Natasha Richardson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001159/","name":"Faye Dunaway","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001644/","name":"Aidan Quinn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0772522/","name":"Volker Schlöndorff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023183/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046677/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021184/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041194/","name":"Margaret Atwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0056217/","name":"Harold Pinter"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Then their relationship takes a turn toward the steamy because he gives Bruno a stipend to investigate eroticism and Bruno chooses Madeleine as his assistant. They experiment with sexy games (e.g., Madeleine's telling Bruno that she isn't wearing underwear when they are out in public, having sex in their car beside the road, pretending to pick each other up in a shoe store, etc.)\n\nThen they are invited to go on holiday in the country with a couple more experienced in eroticism. Solange (Sophie Cnudde) and Maurice (Michel David) are plotting a couple-swapping escapade.\n\nBut before the sex games begin, there is a funny scene in which Marie the maid (Marielle Jonas Oliver) sprays herself with a dye that she had mistaken for a perfume spray while innocently going through Madeleine's things as the two couples were outdoors.

Then their relationship takes a turn toward the steamy because he gives Bruno a stipend to investigate eroticism and Bruno chooses Madeleine as his assistant. They experiment with sexy games (e.g., Madeleine's telling Bruno that she isn't wearing underwear when they are out in public, having sex in their car beside the road, pretending to pick each other up in a shoe store, etc.)\n\nThen they are invited to go on holiday in the country with a couple more experienced in eroticism. Solange (Sophie Cnudde) and Maurice (Michel David) are plotting a couple-swapping escapade.\n\nBut before the sex games begin, there is a funny scene in which Marie the maid (Marielle Jonas Oliver) sprays herself with a dye that she had mistaken for a perfume spray while innocently going through Madeleine's things as the two couples were outdoors. Bruno discovers her when he goes back to the room for his cigarettes. Being the perfect gentleman, he keeps their little secret to himself for which Marie is grateful.\n\nThe sexy games amount to a couple of erotic "dare you" temptations and a visit to a local 24/7 orgy house.

One of my favourite songs was "In my Room" by Brian Wilson. Chasing Mavericks deals with people coming to terms with massive gaps in their lives but somehow focusing on something bigger than themselves to pull through. If you love surfing or the ocean, this movie is for you. Mavericks was brought to world wide attention with Stacey Peralta's film "Riding Giants". Jay has lost his father early in life, and has to act as a pseudo parent for his mother who suffers from the breakup. He accidentally discovers that his much older neighbour Frosty is a big wave surfer and so a teacher mentor relationship starts. Frosty, as well, has terrible father issues which continue to plague him. Their relationship develops momentum and gives each of them energy and purpose. The film underlines the choices we can make in life. Everyone has scars and issues to deal with. Do we give up and spiral downwards or do we set big goals (waves) and go after them. Jay plans carefully in his room to conquer his fears and reach his goal. Excellent and heartfelt acting.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31379,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One of my favourite songs was "In my Room" by Brian Wilson. Chasing Mavericks deals with people coming to terms with massive gaps in their lives but somehow focusing on something bigger than themselves to pull through. If you love surfing or the ocean, this movie is for you. Mavericks was brought to world wide attention with Stacey Peralta's film "Riding Giants". Jay has lost his father early in life, and has to act as a pseudo parent for his mother who suffers from the breakup. He accidentally discovers that his much older neighbour Frosty is a big wave surfer and so a teacher mentor relationship starts. Frosty, as well, has terrible father issues which continue to plague him. Their relationship develops momentum and gives each of them energy and purpose. The film underlines the choices we can make in life. Everyone has scars and issues to deal with. Do we give up and spiral downwards or do we set big goals (waves) and go after them. Jay plans carefully in his room to conquer his fears and reach his goal. Excellent and heartfelt acting.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31379,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A book that's fantastic by the way.\n\nThe first one was disappointing and the second one was horrible. And i do compare the books of Tolkien in real life so i will compare this movie to LOTR. And i really like the LOTR adaptations from the books, but Bilbo don't even come close to Peters first adventure. He has walked trough the door to plastic Hollywood world on these Bilbo movies, when he only had his foot in the last time he created the LOTR movies.\n\nThe new(and old) characters are poorly written in, and takes away light from the dwarfs and Bilbos journey. So you kinda loose interest in what is happening to Bilbo because they're cutting fourth and back between these many add-ons to the story and Bilbo.\n\n3/10"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":612114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A book that's fantastic by the way.\n\nThe first one was disappointing and the second one was horrible. And i do compare the books of Tolkien in real life so i will compare this movie to LOTR. And i really like the LOTR adaptations from the books, but Bilbo don't even come close to Peters first adventure. He has walked trough the door to plastic Hollywood world on these Bilbo movies, when he only had his foot in the last time he created the LOTR movies.\n\nThe new(and old) characters are poorly written in, and takes away light from the dwarfs and Bilbos journey. So you kinda loose interest in what is happening to Bilbo because they're cutting fourth and back between these many add-ons to the story and Bilbo.\n\n3/10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":612114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"duration":"PT2H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, films about politicians and those around them seem to be more successful than the politicians themselves. A good example in this regard is 'Alice et le maire' ('Alice and the Mayor') a film that comes from France, a country that seems to be in recent years in a permanent state of dissatisfaction with the existing economic and social order, with its political institutions and with members of the political class. The film, whose action takes place a few years ago at the City Hall of Lyon and in the milieu of the municipal and political bureaucracy of the Socialist Party, enjoyed an unexpected success without even resorting to sensationalist issues such as crime, sex, or corruption scandals. Perhaps precisely through the relaxed and slightly humorous approach, the script written by Nicolas Pariser (who is also the director of the film) reaches more effectively aspects of deeper, systemic corruption of the French political machinery.\n\nHowever, the premises of the story do not seem too credible. I am not very familiar with the French political system, but I believe that even in France there are no positions for philosophers advisers to the mayors, paid on public money, nor that politicians with decades of political activity and presidential ambitions publicly declare that they are short of ideas. Probably, then, only in the films Alice (Anaïs Demoustier), a fresh graduate from Oxford, could she employed at the City Hall in Lyon just to provide ideas to Mayor Paul Theraneau (Fabrice Luchini) and that could become in a few days or weeks involved at top level in the affairs of the city and of the Socialist Party. The activity of the party on the public money of the town hall also seems little plausible. Probably the whole situation should be viewed more as a cinematic convention rather than real events in the immediate actuality. But even so, the dialogues between the mayor and the young philosopher represent the guiding thread and the most successful and probably the most important part of the movie from the point of view of the filmmakers.\n\nThe discussions between the two protagonists work very well thanks to the charm and the talent of the two actors. The mayor's role is written for Fabrice Luchini who lends to the character his noble style, intellectual charisma and impeccable French language, serving us even with a reading from a book, one of those that made him famous in France. Anaïs Demoustier copes well with the scenes that she shares with Luchini, but also with those that describe her personal dilemmas and the confrontation with the municipal bureaucracy. Secondary roles create believable portrait sketches of Alice's friends and of the politicians and bureaucrats in the town hall hierarchy. The story, however, stumbles badly towards the end, when the politician's decision or indecision at critical moments is difficult to understand, perhaps due to the use of details related to party politics. French viewers might be better off deciphering such details as well as some of the literary and cultural references appearing in discussions, but cinematically the story does not hold water. The approach of 'Alice and the Mayor' is comical and empathetic towards the heroes, the ending is open, so what we get is pleasant entertainment around a political topic. Of course, there will be other films that will address the troubled French political actuality with different approaches and from many other points of view.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"lyon france,mayor,politics,female protagonist,year 2017","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2747252249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1326732/","name":"Anaïs Demoustier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3937233/","name":"Nora Hamzawi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093091/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625796/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, films about politicians and those around them seem to be more successful than the politicians themselves. A good example in this regard is 'Alice et le maire' ('Alice and the Mayor') a film that comes from France, a country that seems to be in recent years in a permanent state of dissatisfaction with the existing economic and social order, with its political institutions and with members of the political class. The film, whose action takes place a few years ago at the City Hall of Lyon and in the milieu of the municipal and political bureaucracy of the Socialist Party, enjoyed an unexpected success without even resorting to sensationalist issues such as crime, sex, or corruption scandals. Perhaps precisely through the relaxed and slightly humorous approach, the script written by Nicolas Pariser (who is also the director of the film) reaches more effectively aspects of deeper, systemic corruption of the French political machinery.\n\nHowever, the premises of the story do not seem too credible. I am not very familiar with the French political system, but I believe that even in France there are no positions for philosophers advisers to the mayors, paid on public money, nor that politicians with decades of political activity and presidential ambitions publicly declare that they are short of ideas. Probably, then, only in the films Alice (Anaïs Demoustier), a fresh graduate from Oxford, could she employed at the City Hall in Lyon just to provide ideas to Mayor Paul Theraneau (Fabrice Luchini) and that could become in a few days or weeks involved at top level in the affairs of the city and of the Socialist Party. The activity of the party on the public money of the town hall also seems little plausible. Probably the whole situation should be viewed more as a cinematic convention rather than real events in the immediate actuality. But even so, the dialogues between the mayor and the young philosopher represent the guiding thread and the most successful and probably the most important part of the movie from the point of view of the filmmakers.\n\nThe discussions between the two protagonists work very well thanks to the charm and the talent of the two actors. The mayor's role is written for Fabrice Luchini who lends to the character his noble style, intellectual charisma and impeccable French language, serving us even with a reading from a book, one of those that made him famous in France. Anaïs Demoustier copes well with the scenes that she shares with Luchini, but also with those that describe her personal dilemmas and the confrontation with the municipal bureaucracy. Secondary roles create believable portrait sketches of Alice's friends and of the politicians and bureaucrats in the town hall hierarchy. The story, however, stumbles badly towards the end, when the politician's decision or indecision at critical moments is difficult to understand, perhaps due to the use of details related to party politics. French viewers might be better off deciphering such details as well as some of the literary and cultural references appearing in discussions, but cinematically the story does not hold water. The approach of 'Alice and the Mayor' is comical and empathetic towards the heroes, the ending is open, so what we get is pleasant entertainment around a political topic. Of course, there will be other films that will address the troubled French political actuality with different approaches and from many other points of view.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"lyon france,mayor,politics,female protagonist,year 2017","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2747252249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1326732/","name":"Anaïs Demoustier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3937233/","name":"Nora Hamzawi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093091/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625796/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is a fine thriller.\n\nFrom the get-go viewers understand that an intelligent maniac is on the loose, and could strike at any time. That is the very definition of cinematic tension. In addition, the killer uses dark, subterranean spaces to torture and kill victims. That inky darkness, together with a haunting musical score further amplifies suspense.\n\nBut, the solution to the whodunit puzzle is ultimately unsatisfying because the screenwriter withholds important back-story from viewers. This could have been so easily fixed with the addition of a line or two of dialogue and/or a brief added scene near the film's beginning. Even so, good plot misdirection creates ample red herrings, so that the killer's identity is not a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe film's cinematography, production design, and editing are fine. Washington does a good job as the paralyzed cop. But Angelina Jolie is miscast; she pouts her way through the film looking like she's bored out of her mind. The support cast helps a lot, with highly credible performances from delightful Queen Latifah, capable Ed O'Neill, and reliable Michael Rooker.\n\nThe crime scenes tended unfortunately to be in-your-face grizzly. But at least the gore quotient was minimal.\n\nFor dark, moody serial killer films set in NYC, I prefer "Sea Of Love" (1989). Nevertheless, "The Bone Collector" can be enjoyed for its elevated level of suspense, its fine cinematography, and its generally high level of acting. Be advised, however, that the film's finale may be a disappointment if you expect all the whodunit puzzle pieces to fall into place, neat and tidy."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159386,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is a fine thriller.\n\nFrom the get-go viewers understand that an intelligent maniac is on the loose, and could strike at any time. That is the very definition of cinematic tension. In addition, the killer uses dark, subterranean spaces to torture and kill victims. That inky darkness, together with a haunting musical score further amplifies suspense.\n\nBut, the solution to the whodunit puzzle is ultimately unsatisfying because the screenwriter withholds important back-story from viewers. This could have been so easily fixed with the addition of a line or two of dialogue and/or a brief added scene near the film's beginning. Even so, good plot misdirection creates ample red herrings, so that the killer's identity is not a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe film's cinematography, production design, and editing are fine. Washington does a good job as the paralyzed cop. But Angelina Jolie is miscast; she pouts her way through the film looking like she's bored out of her mind. The support cast helps a lot, with highly credible performances from delightful Queen Latifah, capable Ed O'Neill, and reliable Michael Rooker.\n\nThe crime scenes tended unfortunately to be in-your-face grizzly. But at least the gore quotient was minimal.\n\nFor dark, moody serial killer films set in NYC, I prefer "Sea Of Love" (1989). Nevertheless, "The Bone Collector" can be enjoyed for its elevated level of suspense, its fine cinematography, and its generally high level of acting. Be advised, however, that the film's finale may be a disappointment if you expect all the whodunit puzzle pieces to fall into place, neat and tidy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159386,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Camera!  Action!  What makes a good movie?  Better yet, what makes a great movie?  In my opinion, a great movie should include almost flawless acting, a finely woven and gripping plot, music that is both beautiful and suitable, and great direction. Of course,  mesmerizing visuals and art direction can also contribute to great films.  So, for all the reasons above, I consider "The City Of Lost Children" the best film of 1996.\n\nThe plot of "The City Of Lost Children" is completely original and it never lets your mind wander off to other places.  It also involves quite a few fascinating and somewhat weird characters in a dreary harbor town called "The City Of Lost Children" (hence the title).   One(that is his name) is a slow-minded circus strongman who searches for his adopted little brother who has been kidnapped by a group of henchmen with robotic eyes called the Cyclops.  One's little brother has been kidnapped and taken to a quickly aging mad scientist named Krank so that his dreams may be stolen.  The mad scientist needs the dreams of children so that he will not age so quickly. The source of this problem is a curse that was put upon him.  Because of this curse, his wife is a midget, he cannot dream, and he has seven identical sons (all of whom have a strange sleeping disorder).  In this movie there is somewhat of a subplot that involves a wicked pair of unseparated siamese twin sisters.  These women run a sort of school where they have the children in it steal for them.  One small, but tough, girl named Miette runs away from the school, finds One, and aides him in his search.  When the two women find out about their little thief, they go to Marcello, a retired man who used to run a circus freakshow, to get what they need to catch and kill the little girl and her newfound friend.  Although this plot seems a bit hard to follow, it all fits together perfectly in the end with wondrous results.  To accompany this odd story,  there is a beautiful soundtrack composed by Angelo Badalmenti with one song ("Who Will Take Your Dreams Away") by Marianne Faithful.  This music fits the mood and plot of the story perfectly and stays with you(as does the movie itself) long after the credits have rolled.\n\nThe casting director of "The City Of Lost Children", Pierre-Jacques Benochou, sure knew what he was doing, because there is not one poor (or mediocre one, for that matter) performance in the whole film.  In fact, I might just say all the performances were virtually flawless.  Ron Perlman's performance as the slow and dimwitted circus strongman One is beautifully acted.  Mr. Perlman should especially be recognized because he is an American actor and this is a subtitled French film.  Daniel Emilfork as the depressed and dreamless mad scientist with a short temper is outstanding and most believable.  Dominique Pinon is wonderful (perhaps the best actor in the whole movie) as the seven rubberfaced identical brothers (yes, he does play all of them, and with fantastic results, too).  The two different actresses who portray the siamese twins, Odile Mallet and Genevieve Brunet, are perfectly wicked and their timing is impeccable.  Last, but not least, the children, with Judith Vittet as Miette in a stand-out performance, all carry out their roles with smashing results.\n\nAnother reason for me choosing "The City Of Lost Children" as the best movie of 1996 is its stunning direction.  This movie was directed by the famous French directing team of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro(a.k.a. "Jeunet and Caro").  The camera angles that are used during the course of this film are a totally different experience and they keep you mesmerized from start to finish.  The directors of this film are, in my opinion, masters of the camera.  The visuals in this movie also contributed to my conclusion that this is the best movie of 1996.  Whatever it might have been, whether the bleak and unique use of colors or the special effects, I was absolutely captivated by what I was seeing on the screen.  What I particularly liked about this film's special effects was that they were not the typical flashy and in-your-face computer special effects that some of today's blockbusters and other genre films seem to have.  I think such special effects distract you from the rest of the movie.  On the contrary, the special effects of "The City Of Lost Children," however, are very subtle.  A final thing I liked about this film were its sets.  From the waterlogged streets of the dank and moldy town to the spectacular gadgetry of Krank's laboratories everything was a magnificent panorama for the eye to behold.\n\nWas the plot great?  Yes.  How was the acting?  Outstanding.  Was the direction done well?  Definitely.  How did the visuals appear?  They were beautifully presented.  From what you have read, whether you have concluded to avoid this movie completely or go out and rent it right away (I do understand that this movie does have a select audience), I am hopeful that you understand the picture I am trying to paint.  Even if the story will not appeal to you, it is still splendidly done.  Overall, though, "The City Of Lost Children" is definitely the best movie of 1996 for me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66486,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1995-05-17","keywords":"psychotronic film,underwater scene,children,dream,aging","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The City of Lost Children","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4236902681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlkNTAzY2MtNmVjYS00Mzk5LWJlNGYtNzI1N2JhZDgwMmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlkNTAzY2MtNmVjYS00Mzk5LWJlNGYtNzI1N2JhZDgwMmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256399/","name":"Daniel Emilfork"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900136/","name":"Judith Vittet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054943/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0545615/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012496/","name":"Gilles Adrien"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Overall, though, "The City Of Lost Children" is definitely the best movie of 1996 for me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66486,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1995-05-17","keywords":"psychotronic film,underwater scene,children,dream,aging","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The City of Lost Children","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4236902681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlkNTAzY2MtNmVjYS00Mzk5LWJlNGYtNzI1N2JhZDgwMmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlkNTAzY2MtNmVjYS00Mzk5LWJlNGYtNzI1N2JhZDgwMmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256399/","name":"Daniel Emilfork","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900136/","name":"Judith Vittet"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070568/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054943/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0545615/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012496/","name":"Gilles Adrien","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Most 12 year olds don't have a job. Perhaps their parents have assigned a few chores around the house to help them learn responsibility, but for the most part, they go to school and play ... the things that kids do. Shia LaBeouf had 2 jobs as a kid. He was a rising actor and he was employer/quasi-guardian of his father. Now in his 30's, LaBeouf has written a screenplay about his childhood and he stars as his father in an attempt to exorcise some personal demons. It also happens to make for compelling cinema.\n\nThe film opens with a montage of cuts between a 20-something LeBeouf (played by Oscar nominee Lucas Hedges) performing stunts on an action movie set (clearly meant to represent TRANSFORMERS) and a serious automobile wreck and subsequent DUI. The wreck caused major damage to his hand and resulted in court-mandated rehabilitation. While in rehab, his therapist (played by Laura San Giacomo) diagnoses him with PTSD ... not military war related, but rather broken family related.\n\nIn this film, LeBeouf has named the character based on himself Otis, and the character based on his own father James Lort. In addition to Hedges playing the early-20's version, another rising actor, Noah Jupe, plays Otis as a 12 year old. As rehabbing Otis puts his childhood memories to paper, we see flashbacks featuring the younger Otis and his father. They live in a dump of a motel, and ride to the TV show set (meant to be "Even Stevens") on dad's motorcycle. James Lort/dad is a former performing clown, recovering addict, and ex-con. He's the kind of guy who talks a big game and blames everyone else for keeping him from succeeding. To put it mildly ... he's a jerk. That's not to say he doesn't have his moments as a caring parent, but those moments are nullified by the bullying and threats of violence towards his young son. That son is desperate to please his dad, yet wise enough to know that he's not to be trusted.\n\nShia LeBeouf dives in head first to play the man who had such an impact on his early years. This, mind you, is the kind of man who offers cigarettes to his young son, makes fun of his pre-pubescent body, and is quite jealous of his budding career. LeBeouf is at his best in a difficult role that surely cuts very deep for him. Supporting roles are played by singer FKA Twigs as the shy neighbor girl who befriends Otis, plus Natasha Lyonne, Maika Monroe, Clifton Collins Jr, and Byron Bowers.\n\nDirector Alma Har'el structures her first narrative feature film (she has previously worked on videos and documentaries) with timelines showing Otis at the two ages. There are no fancy camera tricks. Instead she trusts these talented actors to bring it home ... and that they do very well. Lucas Hedges was Oscar nominated for MANCHESTER BY THE SEA, and he is in the beautiful upcoming film WAVES. Noah Jupe is a star in the making, having previously appeared in A QUIET PLACE, and in the exhilarating upcoming film FORD VS FERRARI. These are some top notch actors at their very best.\n\nAs viewers, we have to remove ourselves from feeling anger and disgust towards the James Lort character. That's easier said than done when he says things like "The only thing my father gave me of any value was pain." It's meant to sum up his reasoning for his own parenting approach. There is a truly brilliant, and well-coordinated scene that acts as a three-way phone conversation between father, son, and estranged wife/mother. The kid is put smack in the middle of the two people who are supposed to love and nurture and protect him. Instead, Otis comes across as the adult.

Most 12 year olds don't have a job. Perhaps their parents have assigned a few chores around the house to help them learn responsibility, but for the most part, they go to school and play ... the things that kids do. Shia LaBeouf had 2 jobs as a kid. He was a rising actor and he was employer/quasi-guardian of his father. Now in his 30's, LaBeouf has written a screenplay about his childhood and he stars as his father in an attempt to exorcise some personal demons. It also happens to make for compelling cinema.\n\nThe film opens with a montage of cuts between a 20-something LeBeouf (played by Oscar nominee Lucas Hedges) performing stunts on an action movie set (clearly meant to represent TRANSFORMERS) and a serious automobile wreck and subsequent DUI. The wreck caused major damage to his hand and resulted in court-mandated rehabilitation. While in rehab, his therapist (played by Laura San Giacomo) diagnoses him with PTSD ... not military war related, but rather broken family related.\n\nIn this film, LeBeouf has named the character based on himself Otis, and the character based on his own father James Lort. In addition to Hedges playing the early-20's version, another rising actor, Noah Jupe, plays Otis as a 12 year old. As rehabbing Otis puts his childhood memories to paper, we see flashbacks featuring the younger Otis and his father. They live in a dump of a motel, and ride to the TV show set (meant to be "Even Stevens") on dad's motorcycle. James Lort/dad is a former performing clown, recovering addict, and ex-con. He's the kind of guy who talks a big game and blames everyone else for keeping him from succeeding. To put it mildly ... he's a jerk. That's not to say he doesn't have his moments as a caring parent, but those moments are nullified by the bullying and threats of violence towards his young son. That son is desperate to please his dad, yet wise enough to know that he's not to be trusted.\n\nShia LeBeouf dives in head first to play the man who had such an impact on his early years. This, mind you, is the kind of man who offers cigarettes to his young son, makes fun of his pre-pubescent body, and is quite jealous of his budding career. LeBeouf is at his best in a difficult role that surely cuts very deep for him. Supporting roles are played by singer FKA Twigs as the shy neighbor girl who befriends Otis, plus Natasha Lyonne, Maika Monroe, Clifton Collins Jr, and Byron Bowers.\n\nDirector Alma Har'el structures her first narrative feature film (she has previously worked on videos and documentaries) with timelines showing Otis at the two ages. There are no fancy camera tricks. Instead she trusts these talented actors to bring it home ... and that they do very well. Lucas Hedges was Oscar nominated for MANCHESTER BY THE SEA, and he is in the beautiful upcoming film WAVES. Noah Jupe is a star in the making, having previously appeared in A QUIET PLACE, and in the exhilarating upcoming film FORD VS FERRARI. These are some top notch actors at their very best.\n\nAs viewers, we have to remove ourselves from feeling anger and disgust towards the James Lort character. That's easier said than done when he says things like "The only thing my father gave me of any value was pain." It's meant to sum up his reasoning for his own parenting approach. There is a truly brilliant, and well-coordinated scene that acts as a three-way phone conversation between father, son, and estranged wife/mother. The kid is put smack in the middle of the two people who are supposed to love and nurture and protect him. Instead, Otis comes across as the adult. We do get some comic relief with the 'world's first daredevil chicken', but this is just not a warm, cuddly father-son fairy tale. This was real life for Shia LeBeouf and he's brave to bring it out in the open, even if it's less confession and more therapeutic session. He deserves it after hearing, "I'm your cheerleader, Honey Boy", and "Trust me, I'm your father."","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Vincent Cassel gives a fine performance as the acclaimed artist Paul Gauguin, who unable to sell his paintings in France, leaves his family in Paris to find inspiration for his work on the island of Tahiti.\n\nThere he meets the Tahitian beauty Tehura (Tuhei Adams), who, while living together, begins to pose for Gauguin's paintings and sketches. However, despite the lush atmospherics of it all, Gauguin finds himself still impoverished, in failing health, and becoming more and possessive and selfish when it comes to young Tehura. The envisioned idyllic life is slipping away.\n\nOverall, despite the powerful performances from Cassel and the debut of Adams, the movie to me just became mostly a slog, although, at times, it seems to come together nicely, but those moments are too few and far between. Thus, just a fair rating for me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2017-09-20","keywords":"painter,artist,starving artist,paris france,year 1891","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Gauguin: Voyage to Tahiti","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1626389273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2MTU5NGYtMDJjOC00NDhhLTk2NDQtNmExOGRkYjRhZjgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2MTU5NGYtMDJjOC00NDhhLTk2NDQtNmExOGRkYjRhZjgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9225337/","name":"Tuheï Adams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956026/","name":"Malik Zidi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435120/","name":"Edouard Deluc"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065288/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0650953/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435120/","name":"Edouard Deluc"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0173541/","name":"Etienne Comar"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1662707/","name":"Thomas Lilti"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Vincent Cassel gives a fine performance as the acclaimed artist Paul Gauguin, who unable to sell his paintings in France, leaves his family in Paris to find inspiration for his work on the island of Tahiti.\n\nThere he meets the Tahitian beauty Tehura (Tuhei Adams), who, while living together, begins to pose for Gauguin's paintings and sketches. However, despite the lush atmospherics of it all, Gauguin finds himself still impoverished, in failing health, and becoming more and possessive and selfish when it comes to young Tehura. The envisioned idyllic life is slipping away.\n\nOverall, despite the powerful performances from Cassel and the debut of Adams, the movie to me just became mostly a slog, although, at times, it seems to come together nicely, but those moments are too few and far between. Thus, just a fair rating for me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2017-09-20","keywords":"painter,artist,starving artist,paris france,year 1891","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Gauguin: Voyage to Tahiti","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1626389273","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2MTU5NGYtMDJjOC00NDhhLTk2NDQtNmExOGRkYjRhZjgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2MTU5NGYtMDJjOC00NDhhLTk2NDQtNmExOGRkYjRhZjgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9225337/","name":"Tuheï Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956026/","name":"Malik Zidi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435120/","name":"Edouard Deluc"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065288/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0650953/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435120/","name":"Edouard Deluc","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0173541/","name":"Etienne Comar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1662707/","name":"Thomas Lilti"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is a movie that captures the old Peckinpah-esquire style of the rugged west and combines wonderfully with Guillermo Arriaga's moody and alienated script. This is a film that could have took a political mood and dealt with the issues of border security and the like, but it smartly refrains from doing so and instead focuses sharply on the heart of society itself - people. \n\nTommy Lee Jones plays Pete, a rancher who has few friends with his closest friends being a woman from town, and a man from Mexico. The woman is the wife of a local diner owner, Rachael (Melissa Leo). She also happens to be extremely bored and engages in extramarital affairs. Pete loves her, but she loves her husband. And possibly the sheriff, and possibly Pete. The other emotional connection in Pete's life, the Mexican, is Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo), an illegal immigrant who finds work and friendship with Pete. Pete loves him like a son, or a brother, or friend, or a combination of all three. Barry Pepper plays Mike, the new border patrolman in town. He is brutal. Perhaps by nature, or not. He is bored; he passes the time sitting outside of his jeep looking at dirty mags. His wife, Lou Ann (January Jones), is also bored. She feels isolated and separated from her husband. She spends her time at the local diner and befriends Rachael. While she sits at home, her husband, the rookie border patrolman, makes a stupid mistake and tries in vain to hide it. The whole town is bored, even the police and the border guards. They find out, the police find out, and in a small town people talk, but more importantly people listen because they have nothing else to do. Pete finds out about Mike's mistake and sets out to carry out Mel's last wishes and bury him in his home town back in Mexico. \n\nThe story has its characters and connects them in ways that we don't always suspect they will connect. No one is a cardboard cut out. Even better, no one is simple. Each character is complex and has their own distinct feelings. A major theme is that of alienation. The characters are alienated not only from each other, but from themselves as well. Earlier i stated that he film took the right road and avoids making a blatant political message. The movie still carries a message though. It is a commentary on life and society. \n\nThe story has parallels to Peckinpah's 'Bring me the Head of Alfedo Garcia.' It has a very Peckinpah style, and features a man who makes a long journey with a dead body. He cares for it and tries to preserve it, even talks to the body sometimes. The film has some great cinematography as well, and the score suits it perfectly. The acting is wonderful, and I have to say that Tommy Lee Jones has rarely ever been better than he is here. Barry Pepper also gives a solid performance. This is Tommy Lee Jones first directing credit in major film and he knocks this one out of the park. Jones clearly has a strong control of his movie and this should go down in history as one of those rare first time wonders. \n\n4/4","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-11-23","keywords":"female nudity,border,u.s. border patrol,buying a house,handcuffed","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3674013977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU4M2VmYmYtMzFjZi00MTBjLThhMWQtYzBjNjdlNTdkMjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU4M2VmYmYtMzFjZi00MTBjLThhMWQtYzBjNjdlNTdkMjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001608/","name":"Barry Pepper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0948267/","name":"Dwight Yoakam"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029146/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0037247/","name":"Guillermo Arriaga"}],"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is a film that could have took a political mood and dealt with the issues of border security and the like, but it smartly refrains from doing so and instead focuses sharply on the heart of society itself - people. \n\nTommy Lee Jones plays Pete, a rancher who has few friends with his closest friends being a woman from town, and a man from Mexico. The woman is the wife of a local diner owner, Rachael (Melissa Leo). She also happens to be extremely bored and engages in extramarital affairs. Pete loves her, but she loves her husband. And possibly the sheriff, and possibly Pete. The other emotional connection in Pete's life, the Mexican, is Melquiades Estrada (Julio Cedillo), an illegal immigrant who finds work and friendship with Pete. Pete loves him like a son, or a brother, or friend, or a combination of all three. Barry Pepper plays Mike, the new border patrolman in town. He is brutal. Perhaps by nature, or not. He is bored; he passes the time sitting outside of his jeep looking at dirty mags. His wife, Lou Ann (January Jones), is also bored. She feels isolated and separated from her husband. She spends her time at the local diner and befriends Rachael. While she sits at home, her husband, the rookie border patrolman, makes a stupid mistake and tries in vain to hide it. The whole town is bored, even the police and the border guards. They find out, the police find out, and in a small town people talk, but more importantly people listen because they have nothing else to do. Pete finds out about Mike's mistake and sets out to carry out Mel's last wishes and bury him in his home town back in Mexico. \n\nThe story has its characters and connects them in ways that we don't always suspect they will connect. No one is a cardboard cut out. Even better, no one is simple. Each character is complex and has their own distinct feelings. A major theme is that of alienation. The characters are alienated not only from each other, but from themselves as well. Earlier i stated that he film took the right road and avoids making a blatant political message. The movie still carries a message though. It is a commentary on life and society. \n\nThe story has parallels to Peckinpah's 'Bring me the Head of Alfedo Garcia.' It has a very Peckinpah style, and features a man who makes a long journey with a dead body. He cares for it and tries to preserve it, even talks to the body sometimes. The film has some great cinematography as well, and the score suits it perfectly. The acting is wonderful, and I have to say that Tommy Lee Jones has rarely ever been better than he is here. Barry Pepper also gives a solid performance. This is Tommy Lee Jones first directing credit in major film and he knocks this one out of the park. Jones clearly has a strong control of his movie and this should go down in history as one of those rare first time wonders. \n\n4/4","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-11-23","keywords":"female nudity,border,u.s. border patrol,buying a house,handcuffed","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3674013977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU4M2VmYmYtMzFjZi00MTBjLThhMWQtYzBjNjdlNTdkMjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU4M2VmYmYtMzFjZi00MTBjLThhMWQtYzBjNjdlNTdkMjNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001608/","name":"Barry Pepper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0948267/","name":"Dwight Yoakam"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029146/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0037247/","name":"Guillermo Arriaga"],"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I think the uninspired, boring story writing was probably the worst aspect of the movie overall. The characters did their job, but they weren't really memorable or stuck to you well.\n\nThe only thing that the movie was able to knock out of the park, however, was definitely the graphics.

I think the uninspired, boring story writing was probably the worst aspect of the movie overall. The characters did their job, but they weren't really memorable or stuck to you well.\n\nThe only thing that the movie was able to knock out of the park, however, was definitely the graphics.

However, the animation part of the graphics weren't great and I definitely saw better, especially when it came to lip-syncing.\n\nOverall, an honest middle-of-the-road movie experience.

When I first saw the preview, I was completely doubtful as to the quality of this movie. I mean, accidental marriage in Vegas? Ashton Kutcher AND Cameron Diaz? Like, together? It was a bit scary.\n\nHowever, after watching it I realized I'd had a lot of fun through the movie. It's only and hour and a half, so it's not going to stretch on forever. Kutcher and Diaz provided enough funny moments to make the movie fairly amusing, but what really surprised me was their chemistry. Maybe it was because I was so negative about it before, but they went together well. There were also a few sweet moments and a few with more tension, which was good. Unfortunately, I found some other parts of the movie sweeter than the end, but it wasn't that bad.\n\nThe screenplay is nothing new, but then what movie is THAT original? Not many. The point is, it's fun and a good time if you want to spend an hour or so relaxing. Even my brother (who is a die hard action fan) didn't mind the movie.\n\nNo matter how original or unexpected a movie is, if it doesn't entertain me, I DON'T CARE. This one was entertaining. Isn't that the point of films? Oh, and the soundtrack was a blast!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":168811,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-05-07","keywords":"jackpot,wedding,drunkenness,hit in the crotch,father son relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What Happens in Vegas ...

When I first saw the preview, I was completely doubtful as to the quality of this movie. I mean, accidental marriage in Vegas? Ashton Kutcher AND Cameron Diaz? Like, together? It was a bit scary.\n\nHowever, after watching it I realized I'd had a lot of fun through the movie. It's only and hour and a half, so it's not going to stretch on forever. Kutcher and Diaz provided enough funny moments to make the movie fairly amusing, but what really surprised me was their chemistry. Maybe it was because I was so negative about it before, but they went together well. There were also a few sweet moments and a few with more tension, which was good. Unfortunately, I found some other parts of the movie sweeter than the end, but it wasn't that bad.\n\nThe screenplay is nothing new, but then what movie is THAT original? Not many. The point is, it's fun and a good time if you want to spend an hour or so relaxing. Even my brother (who is a die hard action fan) didn't mind the movie.\n\nNo matter how original or unexpected a movie is, if it doesn't entertain me, I DON'T CARE. This one was entertaining. Isn't that the point of films? Oh, and the soundtrack was a blast!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":168811,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-05-07","keywords":"jackpot,wedding,drunkenness,hit in the crotch,father son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What Happens in Vegas ...

Marty, Gloria and Melman don't have as much to do but they aren't completely side-lined. The penguins and King Julien steal every scene they're in. And the new characters are just delightful, especially Vitaly and DuBois. The voice acting is top notch, Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett Smith and David Schwimmer all do very appealing jobs. Sacha Baron Cohen is as witty as ever as King Julien, likewise with the penguins with Tom McGrath standing out as Skipper. The dogs are fun too. Bryan Cranston is subtly menacing, Jessica Chastain is charming and Martin Short is funny, but the jewel(and possibly the best single voice-over of the three movies) is Frances McDormand, whose DuBois is note-perfect.\n\nIn conclusion, a very good sequel and movie and my vote for the best of the Madagascar movies. 8/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":169583,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-06-13","keywords":"animal,circus,penguin,lemur,giraffe","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1169137689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTkxMDU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU0NzIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIxNTkxMDU4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTU0NzIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe and Gloria the Hippo join a traveling circus in an effort to get back home to New York."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000586/","name":"Jada Pinkett Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001674/","name":"Chris Rock"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201509/","name":"Eric Darnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0569891/","name":"Tom McGrath"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0970447/","name":"Conrad Vernon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201509/","name":"Eric Darnell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000876/","name":"Noah Baumbach"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123666/","name":"Mark Burton"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger.

He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Furthermore, why is Branch depressed again, and where the hell did DJ Suki go? What I did like about it however, is the impressive animation and the fact that they are diverse to other cultures by having certain music genres from other countries such as Korea, Africa and Scotland. If you are a fan of Trolls, I would recommend it, otherwise it's best not to watch this movie as you might get bored.

The problem with this movie is that they have used so many clichés that it's not even funny. In fact, they used nearly every common cliché you can think of. Furthermore, why is Branch depressed again, and where the hell did DJ Suki go? What I did like about it however, is the impressive animation and the fact that they are diverse to other cultures by having certain music genres from other countries such as Korea, Africa and Scotland. If you are a fan of Trolls, I would recommend it, otherwise it's best not to watch this movie as you might get bored. Personally, I am glad this sequel went straight to digital because of how forgettable it was.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18660,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

"Fourmi " (=ant;the football wizard is too short to be signed to Arsenal )is the story of a redemption.Theo knows that ,if he does not qualify for the selection,his father's life is irreparably doomed ;so he's compelled to lie to his coach (André Dussolier) and his assistant (who seems to prefer pastry cook to football,so do I).\n\nOnly his good friend,Karim is in secret ;as for the youngsters ' performances ,it's uneven :it goes from good (Laurent,Karim) to mediocre (Max ,the computer wizzard :how could you believe this giddy jerk would be able to write an email using the perfect club jargon,? the young actor acts as if he does not care)\n\nThe subject of the movie is a man's redemption ;it renders the denouement null and void ,a crowd-pleaser ,the expected event ; the movie would have been a hundred times more convincing without it , and reductio ad aburdum that a lie can be vital to save a human life .And that a man can help himself ,and ,after a while does not need his son's prowesses to be a human being again ( the bedroom he paints for him speaks volumes about his metamorphosis).And Mr Damiens was up to scratch!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-04","keywords":"alcoholic,competition,boy,fraud,father son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3418340889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRhMGJmYTMtMGI4OC00Y2E2LWJiZDgtZTU5ZWVlMTc0NGUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRhMGJmYTMtMGI4OC00Y2E2LWJiZDgtZTU5ZWVlMTc0NGUxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1460782/","name":"François Damiens","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9521992/","name":"Maleaume Paquin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244707/","name":"André Dussollier"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1272853/","name":"Julien Rappeneau"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170513/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0663623/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10965776/","name":"Artur Laperla","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1272853/","name":"Julien Rappeneau","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6504693/","name":"Mario Torrecillas"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But I was very disappointed.\n\nEssentially, the BBC has transformed Maigret into a hard-boiled British detective with none of the subtlety of Georges Simenon's French detective. \n\nOf course they take liberties with the stories, and this is normal and to be expected with TV / movie dramatizations of books, but the dialog is very disappointing and not at all the Maigret of Simenon.\n\nIt's not terrible, but Michael Gambon's Maigret is not good either. Better to obtain and watch the Bruno Cremer version, even though it requires you know French or read subtitles.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":716,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1992-02-09","keywords":"character name as series title,whodunit,red herring,detective,surname as series title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002091/","name":"Michael Gambon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404232/","name":"Geoffrey Hutchings","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0303177/","name":"Jack Galloway"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103289/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Antonio Banderas plays the famous and rowdy bandit,he is perfect in title role.Remainder casting is frankly well:Alan Arkin,Colm Feore(Griffith),Michel McKean,Kyle Chandler..Another films about Villa feats are : the classic ¨Viva Villa¨with Wallace Beery,forever belongs this role;¨Villa¨with Rodolfo Hoyos and Brian Keith; ¨Villa riders¨with Yul Brynner,¨Pancho Villa¨with Telly Savalas and Clint Walker.\n\nThe picture is based on true events,thus : Pancho Villa born in Chihuahua with the name Doroteo Arango,from his peasant upbringing he became an outlaw in his youth and adopted the name Francisco Villa from another outlaw.He played a leading role in the Mexican Revolution(1910-1920),winning many victories (as Torreon battle narrated in the film).For a time Villa,who seemed in line for leadership of Mexico,enjoyed the agreeable interest of the United States government;but William Randolph Hearsts media empire's press campaign against him and USA authorities then dropped Villa and supported his rival,Carranza.Villa's resentment resulted in the revenge raid on Columbus(deeds narrated in another films but no here) by General Pershing's column.Unable to suppress Villa by force,the Mexican government purchased his retirement from the political arena as a weary, disillusioned political liability with a handsome pension and large estate.Villa was assassinated in 1923 when gunmen ambushed his car.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3255,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2003-09-07","keywords":"revisionist western,man murders a woman,pancho villa,battle,bandit","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3568697625","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY0MWY4MTUtY2U1OC00MjZjLTk1NWYtNjU0NTdiZGJiZjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjY0MWY4MTUtY2U1OC00MjZjLTk1NWYtNjU0NTdiZGJiZjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0047248/","name":"Eion Bailey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000273/","name":"Alan Arkin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000915/","name":"Bruce Beresford"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093881/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060770/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005861/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0312205/","name":"Larry Gelbart"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There has never been a show or a film that came as close to showing what life must have been like in those lawless young towns that got built nearly over night wherever gold was found. A magnet for all kind of fortune seekers (gold diggers, whores, outlaws – but also settlers who were just hoping to build a better life), the town of Deadwood was notorious even by the standards of the time. In the show, this "cesspool of vice" is brought back to life with great attention to historical detail. You'll find no romanticised view of pioneers who lived and died by "the code of honour", but real people whose moral standards are – in most cases – murky at best. And the world they inhabit is a rough, dirty, violent place where only the fiercest – and the most cunning – survive. \n\nAs far as the historical characters depicted in the show are concerned, the writers naturally had to take some liberties (after all, nobody knows exactly who said or did what at the time), but the depiction of the era and the historical background are very accurate. Yet this is not a history lesson; it's an immensely entertaining western-show blessed with some of the best writers and actors working in television and film today – and especially the cast of 'Deadwood' really can't get enough praise: there is not a single performance here that isn't excellent. Of course, the one who steals the show is Ian McShane. His Al Swearengen is one of the most morally complex and fun-to-watch characters I've ever seen (and he misses absolutely no opportunity to show you just what the first five letters in "SWEAR-engen" stand for). The power-struggles in Deadwood he is involved in – and since he wants to maintain his position at the top of the food-chain he's involved in all of them – are equalled in complexity and entertainment value only by those in top-notch shows like 'Game of Thrones', 'House of Cards' or 'Breaking Bad'. And the lengths Al is willing to go to achieve his goals secure him a place in the top ten of "all-time great bad-asses".\n\nSo my verdict: While certainly not for the easily offended or those who prefer a "sanitized version" of the old west, 'Deadwood' offers a fascinating look at a time we mostly know from myths and legends and gives us a chance to revisit those and see them from a different angle. Great, intelligent and informative entertainment. 9 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":97527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There has never been a show or a film that came as close to showing what life must have been like in those lawless young towns that got built nearly over night wherever gold was found. A magnet for all kind of fortune seekers (gold diggers, whores, outlaws – but also settlers who were just hoping to build a better life), the town of Deadwood was notorious even by the standards of the time. In the show, this "cesspool of vice" is brought back to life with great attention to historical detail. You'll find no romanticised view of pioneers who lived and died by "the code of honour", but real people whose moral standards are – in most cases – murky at best. And the world they inhabit is a rough, dirty, violent place where only the fiercest – and the most cunning – survive. \n\nAs far as the historical characters depicted in the show are concerned, the writers naturally had to take some liberties (after all, nobody knows exactly who said or did what at the time), but the depiction of the era and the historical background are very accurate. Yet this is not a history lesson; it's an immensely entertaining western-show blessed with some of the best writers and actors working in television and film today – and especially the cast of 'Deadwood' really can't get enough praise: there is not a single performance here that isn't excellent. Of course, the one who steals the show is Ian McShane. His Al Swearengen is one of the most morally complex and fun-to-watch characters I've ever seen (and he misses absolutely no opportunity to show you just what the first five letters in "SWEAR-engen" stand for). The power-struggles in Deadwood he is involved in – and since he wants to maintain his position at the top of the food-chain he's involved in all of them – are equalled in complexity and entertainment value only by those in top-notch shows like 'Game of Thrones', 'House of Cards' or 'Breaking Bad'. And the lengths Al is willing to go to achieve his goals secure him a place in the top ten of "all-time great bad-asses".\n\nSo my verdict: While certainly not for the easily offended or those who prefer a "sanitized version" of the old west, 'Deadwood' offers a fascinating look at a time we mostly know from myths and legends and gives us a chance to revisit those and see them from a different angle. Great, intelligent and informative entertainment. 9 stars out of 10.\n\nFavorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/\n\nLesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/\n\nFavorite Low-Budget and B-movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/\n\nFavorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":97527,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS films are an example of an "A" in this category. Last year's GEOSTORM was a "B" (it was so over-the-top that it was fun, especially when the meteorologist declared - as if he was reciting Shakespeare - "Oh my God, it's a GEOSTORM!"). Unfortunately, a "C" example of this is THE HURRICANE HEIST.\n\nDirected by Rob Cohen - who brought us the original FAST AND FURIOUS film lo' those many years ago - THE HURRICANE HEIST tells the tale of a HEIST set during a...anyone?...HURRICANE. That's pretty much all you need to know of the plot. The rest is action, escapes, weather gone bad, bad guys being bad guys and good guys being good guys.\n\nThe good guys are Toby Kebbel (so good as the motion capture bad-guy ape in DAWN OF THE PLANET OF THE APES), perennial "B"-movie actress Maggie Grace (TAKEN, LOST and the immortal HOT GIRL, FAST CAR, EATING A BANANA) and Ryan Kwanten (I guess he was in TRUE BLOOD). What do these good guys have in common? They are not hard to look at on the screen. The two men also have really bad Southern accents.\n\nThe bad guys are led by Ralph Ineson ( a perennial "that guy" in such films as STAR WARS: THE LAST JEDI, GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY and KINGSMAN: THE SECRET SERVICE) and a host of "red shirts". The problem is that Ineson plays his bad guy role as a "that guy" and the "red shirts" have no personality at all. One guy tries to be the "loose cannon" but he doesn't go far enough, nor does Ineson or ANY of the bad guys.\n\nOh...did I mention Ben Cross (Sarek in the new STAR TREK films)? Cross leaped off the screen in the Oscar winning film CHARIOTS OF FIRE way back in 1981 and was going to be "the next big thing". How has that worked out for him? I'm sure he's making a nice living, but...\n\nBut...you don't come to this kind of films for the acting. You come to it for the insane premise, the over-the-top acting, the out-of-this-world stunts and special effects. Unfortunately, THE HURRICANE HEIST plays each one of these "safely". The premise is insane, just not insane enough. The acting is melodramatic - just not over-the-top. The script doesn't really have any "oh-my-gosh, did he just say that" lines and the action, stunts and special effects are pretty good, (maybe even good), but not great.\n\nA pretty mediocre time at the movies. It did serve it's purpose, I turned my brain off for two hours. I just wish it didn't power down as well.\n\nLetter Grade: C (thanks for trying)\n\n5 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19893,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"2018-03-09","keywords":"disaster movie,hurricane,heist,category 5 hurricane,meteorologist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3874076697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM0NWYwZjQtNDhlNy00NGE1LWJiOTctMzRiOGJmZmUzYzk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM0NWYwZjQtNDhlNy00NGE1LWJiOTctMzRiOGJmZmUzYzk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Under the threat of a hurricane, opportunistic criminals infiltrate a US Mint facility to steal $600 million for the ultimate heist.

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is a more confident, assured outing than the first film and while it does not draw from Mignola's comics for its plot it is perhaps better off for it, lacking the usual burden of comparison and expectations. "The Golden Army" is more fantastical than the first film and is less sci-fi oriented but this is the sort of thing Del Toro does exceptionally well as a writer. He never lets the fantasy become the focus of the film, instead concentrating on characters and delivering action scenes that can only be described as, forgive the crass immaturity, kickass.\n\nAs entertaining as many comic book-to-film adaptations are it is a rare event when one can call one of these films a true artistic achievement. I am convinced without a shadow of a doubt that Guillermo Del Toro's entire career has been leading up to this film, particularly regarding his work as screenwriter here. The comedy feels less forced and is worked incredibly well into the script here, so much so that it doesn't feel remotely unnatural when the scene of comic drunken singing leads directly without a break into one of the film's most intensely dramatic sequences. Del Toro's handling of character has never been better, not even with "The Devil's Backbone", which is still my favorite of his films, and his sheer skill and ability when it comes to telling a fairytale-esquire fantasy is astonishing, as proved in the prologue to this film. In short this is Del Toro at the top of his game and providing artistry the likes of which we rarely if ever see in summer blockbusters. It's only fair that an astonishingly brilliant comic like "Hellboy" by an astonishingly brilliant artist like Mike Mignola is adapted this well and by someone as talented at what they do as he is.\n\nHow refreshing it is, a week after the release of "Hancock", which to me epitomizes everything wrong with action film-making today, that we get "The Golden Army" which features hands down some of the finest action scenes we have ever seen in this sort of film. Just stunningly beautiful, well-shot, well-crafted, the sort of thing that leaves one wondering how much time and effort went into it and endlessly thankful that some really talented people went to the trouble of making the film. \n\nThe film is generally just superb on a technical level. Why am I even saying this? Of course it is. Danny Elfman composing, Guillermo Navarro serving as cinematographer, top-notch editors, fantastic special effects wizards. It's a world-class crew that made this film. I shouldn't be surprised at its quality but "The Golden Army" really just floored and astonished me with how good it is. The cast is also excellent, proving once again that you don't need 'big names' to carry a movie.

"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" is a more confident, assured outing than the first film and while it does not draw from Mignola's comics for its plot it is perhaps better off for it, lacking the usual burden of comparison and expectations. "The Golden Army" is more fantastical than the first film and is less sci-fi oriented but this is the sort of thing Del Toro does exceptionally well as a writer. He never lets the fantasy become the focus of the film, instead concentrating on characters and delivering action scenes that can only be described as, forgive the crass immaturity, kickass.\n\nAs entertaining as many comic book-to-film adaptations are it is a rare event when one can call one of these films a true artistic achievement. I am convinced without a shadow of a doubt that Guillermo Del Toro's entire career has been leading up to this film, particularly regarding his work as screenwriter here. The comedy feels less forced and is worked incredibly well into the script here, so much so that it doesn't feel remotely unnatural when the scene of comic drunken singing leads directly without a break into one of the film's most intensely dramatic sequences. Del Toro's handling of character has never been better, not even with "The Devil's Backbone", which is still my favorite of his films, and his sheer skill and ability when it comes to telling a fairytale-esquire fantasy is astonishing, as proved in the prologue to this film. In short this is Del Toro at the top of his game and providing artistry the likes of which we rarely if ever see in summer blockbusters. It's only fair that an astonishingly brilliant comic like "Hellboy" by an astonishingly brilliant artist like Mike Mignola is adapted this well and by someone as talented at what they do as he is.\n\nHow refreshing it is, a week after the release of "Hancock", which to me epitomizes everything wrong with action film-making today, that we get "The Golden Army" which features hands down some of the finest action scenes we have ever seen in this sort of film. Just stunningly beautiful, well-shot, well-crafted, the sort of thing that leaves one wondering how much time and effort went into it and endlessly thankful that some really talented people went to the trouble of making the film. \n\nThe film is generally just superb on a technical level. Why am I even saying this? Of course it is. Danny Elfman composing, Guillermo Navarro serving as cinematographer, top-notch editors, fantastic special effects wizards. It's a world-class crew that made this film. I shouldn't be surprised at its quality but "The Golden Army" really just floored and astonished me with how good it is. The cast is also excellent, proving once again that you don't need 'big names' to carry a movie. Just about everyone here is excellent, particularly Perlman with another excellent turn as Hellboy and the underrated Selma Blair as Liz Sherman. \n\n"Hellboy II: The Golden Army" provides essentially everything a Del Toro or Mignola fan would want. I imagine it will entertain and charm many outside those circles as well with its fantastic action sequences, engaging characters, and wonderful sense of humor. I would personally go as far as calling "Hellboy II: The Golden Army" one of the top five or so comic book movies ever made.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":259903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie was directed by Roger Donaldson; who's directed such popular hits as 'COCTAIL', 'CADILLAC MAN', 'THE BOUNTY', 'SPECIES' and 'DANTE'S PEAK' (which also stars Brosnan). It was written by Michael Finch and Karl Gajdusek and based on the book 'There Are No Spies' (which is the seventh installment in 'The November Man' series) by Bill Granger. It costars Luke Bracey, Olga Kurylenko, Bill Smitrovich and Will Patton. I found it to be pretty entertaining and surprisingly dark, and violent, but still nothing too new or interesting to offer fans of the genre.\n\nBrosnan plays Peter Devereaux; an ex-CIA agent who retired after a student of his, David Mason (Bracey), accidentally killed a kid (while the two were doing an assignment together in Montenegro). Since that time Peter has started a relationship with another CIA operative, named Natalia Ulanova (Mediha Musilovic). He comes out of retirement to aid her on a deep cover assignment in Russia, when she's murdered by Mason; under the orders of CIA chief Perry Weinstein (Patton). Peter then wants revenge on the CIA, for killing Natalia, and will stop at nothing to find out what vital information she uncovered and why she was killed for it.\n\nThe story is that of a pretty routine espionage thriller but it does take some pretty dark turns, here and there. Both Brosnan and Bracey's characters do some pretty questionable 'anti-heroic' things that, at times, leave the viewer questioning who they're supposed to root for. So in that way I really enjoyed the movie. Brosnan does slip back into the ultimate spy role with plenty of ease and Donaldson does a pretty effective job delivering the action. Kurylenko looks stunning as usual (and even uncannily resembles a young Catherine Zeta-Jones in some scenes). The film might not have much original to offer, fans of the genre, but it's still a lot of fun; I'd even say it's better than about half of the James Bond movies.\n\nWatch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/NiZxP8LDXto","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64462,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's a fairly easy genre to master, and an easy way to make a good movie. This is one of the best examples, since Smith and Lawrence really do compliment each other so well; Smith's the sleek, cool one who is popular with the ladies, while Lawrence is often nervous, and pretty much a direct opposite of Smith.

Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!\n\nDirector, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson &amp; Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth! \n\nIn the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of "Super-Star". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do so What a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!) \n\nOn the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already aware audiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .\n\nFor my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .\n\nTo highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .\n\nBefore rushing out to see it, just a little warning. For those who yearn for Action-packed blockbusters, Begins might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled! And for those who crave really intense human drama, since, at the end of the day, this is still a comic book "super-hero", not some conflicted politician, or not even anything close Let's try to keep things in perspective, O.K.?

A chief of an international aid agency in Africa called Wren (Charlize Theron) runs the International Council in Geneva , Switzerland , coordinating the international activities common to the operational centres , as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters . Then , Wren arrives in Africa and meets a relief aid doctor Miguel Leon (Javier Bardem) who belongs to ¨Médecins Sans Frontières¨ (MSF , vast majority of staff are volunteers) , also known as ¨Doctors Without Borders¨ and both of whom fall in love . The doctor Wren joins a group of obstinate doctors (Adèle Exarchopoulos , Jared Harris , Jean Reno , Denise Newman) who help unfortunate and distressed African people and undergo risked operations to wounded townsfolk . Meanwhile , in Monrovia , Liberia , takes place a state coup , and then they get together to flee from the capital to Sierra Leona . They embark in a dangerous journey which will take various countries risking his own life and pursued by nasty guerrillas .\n\nIntelligent drama with plenty of emotion , moving scenes and sensational performances . This is a deliberately paced flick , a satisfying journey of love , justice and self-discovery amidst political/social revolutions . It displays great feeling , thrills , and provoking melodrama in which a couple takes on strong choices surrounding humanitarianism and tough lives through civil unrest . This brooding flick sometimes results to be slow-moving , relying heavily on the long love affair and both of them compliment each other with their destine to help the unfortunate natives of African countries . Being developed in sensibility and intelligence , here are narrated ethic , moral issues with great sense of ductility and in ¨Terence Malick¨ style . As the stubborn doctors expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race , religion , creed or political affiliation . Cast is frankly good and giving top-notch interpretations . As the Spanish Javier Bardem providing an awesome acting , he grants his character a self-righteous drive that is made poignant for her determination and sheer will . Very magnetic performance by Charlize Theron as member of an aid agency directing efforts to provide medical care in acute crises , she gives the right balance of self-righteousness which makes her performance more real , she also creates her character human , heart and determination with her role , not a stereotype . The movie contains thrilling and violent scenes like the breathtaking battle when the military revolutionaries going into the capital Monrovia in blood and fire , as well as rampage , ravage and the indiscriminate massacres carried out by the extremely violent revolutionary guerrillas . And including gory scenes , such as grisly killings in cold blood and an astonishing surgical Cesarian . Beautiful , haunting and mesmerizing cinematography by Barry Ackroyd . Perceptible , and at times rousing musical score by the prestigious composer Hans Zimmer , including some really sensitive songs in African sounds . \n\nThe motion picture was professionally -though in complex narrative filled with flashbacks- directed by Sean Penn . Here Penn tells an African story full of death and violence and presents it with impressive truth , though being both , overlong and touching . Sean Penn tops his last directional effort with an intense drama that is moving , scary and down right forthright . This "The Last Face" (2016) will appeal to Javier Bardem and Charlize Theron fans .","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4629,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A chief of an international aid agency in Africa called Wren (Charlize Theron) runs the International Council in Geneva , Switzerland , coordinating the international activities common to the operational centres , as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters . Then , Wren arrives in Africa and meets a relief aid doctor Miguel Leon (Javier Bardem) who belongs to ¨Médecins Sans Frontières¨ (MSF , vast majority of staff are volunteers) , also known as ¨Doctors Without Borders¨ and both of whom fall in love . The doctor Wren joins a group of obstinate doctors (Adèle Exarchopoulos , Jared Harris , Jean Reno , Denise Newman) who help unfortunate and distressed African people and undergo risked operations to wounded townsfolk . Meanwhile , in Monrovia , Liberia , takes place a state coup , and then they get together to flee from the capital to Sierra Leona . They embark in a dangerous journey which will take various countries risking his own life and pursued by nasty guerrillas .\n\nIntelligent drama with plenty of emotion , moving scenes and sensational performances . This is a deliberately paced flick , a satisfying journey of love , justice and self-discovery amidst political/social revolutions . It displays great feeling , thrills , and provoking melodrama in which a couple takes on strong choices surrounding humanitarianism and tough lives through civil unrest . This brooding flick sometimes results to be slow-moving , relying heavily on the long love affair and both of them compliment each other with their destine to help the unfortunate natives of African countries . Being developed in sensibility and intelligence , here are narrated ethic , moral issues with great sense of ductility and in ¨Terence Malick¨ style . As the stubborn doctors expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race , religion , creed or political affiliation . Cast is frankly good and giving top-notch interpretations . As the Spanish Javier Bardem providing an awesome acting , he grants his character a self-righteous drive that is made poignant for her determination and sheer will . Very magnetic performance by Charlize Theron as member of an aid agency directing efforts to provide medical care in acute crises , she gives the right balance of self-righteousness which makes her performance more real , she also creates her character human , heart and determination with her role , not a stereotype . The movie contains thrilling and violent scenes like the breathtaking battle when the military revolutionaries going into the capital Monrovia in blood and fire , as well as rampage , ravage and the indiscriminate massacres carried out by the extremely violent revolutionary guerrillas . And including gory scenes , such as grisly killings in cold blood and an astonishing surgical Cesarian . Beautiful , haunting and mesmerizing cinematography by Barry Ackroyd . Perceptible , and at times rousing musical score by the prestigious composer Hans Zimmer , including some really sensitive songs in African sounds . \n\nThe motion picture was professionally -though in complex narrative filled with flashbacks- directed by Sean Penn . Here Penn tells an African story full of death and violence and presents it with impressive truth , though being both , overlong and touching . Sean Penn tops his last directional effort with an intense drama that is moving , scary and down right forthright . This "The Last Face" (2016) will appeal to Javier Bardem and Charlize Theron fans .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4629,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Of all the puzzling elements in this bizarre epic, the most inexplicable is Christian Bale as Moses. Not the choice of Christian Bale - commercial operation, remember - no, that I understand, what's inexplicable is his performance. We know now Christian Bale is a great actor. Great. The Fighter alone puts him right up there with some of the best of his generation so why then he's so bad, but so bad here. His Moses is absent. Not a moment of truth, not a moment of real connection. Was he a hostage, performing against his will? That's what I felt, that he didn't want to be there and that alone made me watch the whole film with disdain. What a disheartening experience. I give it a 2 and not a 1 out of respect for the crew, because their work is real and present on the screen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":161817,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Of all the puzzling elements in this bizarre epic, the most inexplicable is Christian Bale as Moses. Not the choice of Christian Bale - commercial operation, remember - no, that I understand, what's inexplicable is his performance. We know now Christian Bale is a great actor. Great. The Fighter alone puts him right up there with some of the best of his generation so why then he's so bad, but so bad here. His Moses is absent. Not a moment of truth, not a moment of real connection. Was he a hostage, performing against his will? That's what I felt, that he didn't want to be there and that alone made me watch the whole film with disdain. What a disheartening experience. I give it a 2 and not a 1 out of respect for the crew, because their work is real and present on the screen.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":161817,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

French director Luc Besson (Leon, The Fifth Element) arrived at the "Yes Planet" theater in Ramat-Gan, Israel early afternoon, to attend the show. Right before the screening began, he asked the audience to open it's heart, and added something about the film being aimed mainly for kids. He was right.\n\nMaybe it's that bitter 26-year-old guy in me that just couldn't let go of that aching sarcasm that prevented me from really enjoying this half CGI animated/half live action film. Maybe it's the fact that i've just seen so many similar products through the course of my life, that I found it heard to be excited or (god forbid) enthusiastic during this one. Whatever the cause, I couldn't help but reaching the eventual conclusion that Arthur and the Minimoys didn't live up to it's potential. If Besson had just moved one step forward with his imagination, if the twists had been just a tad more original, if the ending hadn't felt so quick and rushed - I could have had a much better time.\n\nThe plot line is easy to follow: 10 year-old Arthur, played by Freddie Highmore of Charlie and the Chocolate fame, lives in a small town with his grandmother, portrayed by Mia Farrow (Rosemary's Baby, The Purple Rose of Cairo). It's the early 1960's and Arthur, who is neglected by his parents, escapes his loneliness by hearing stories of his absent grandfather's journeys to imaginative lands. Reality, however, is grim, as Grandpa has been missing for three years and Grandma must raise a large sum of money in 48 hours, or her land will be seized by the local authorities. Determined to save the property, Arthur sets out on a journey to the land of the Minimoys, extremely small beings who live in his garden, in search of expensive rubies that can put an end to Grandma's debts. From here on out the story turns CGI, as Arthur is shrinked to the size of an average Minimoy himself. On his journey, he falls in love with princess Selenia (voiced by Madonna), befriends a rastaman underground dweller named Max (Snoop Dog) and faces the evil being referred to as "M" (David Bowie). \n\nWhile the animation is colorful and filled with imagination, the plot moves so fast you don't have much time to really notice the details. Also, there are some supposedly subtle remarks about sex, marriage and corrupt leaders which I don't think are fully appropriate for kids.\n\nBottom Line, Arthur and the Minimoys is an OK ride, but nothing we haven't seen before. From the recent animated The Ant Bully, through the classic 1980's Honey I Shrunk the Kids, the famed story of King Arthur and even The Matrix - it's all homaged, if not copied, in this new entry.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34167,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

French director Luc Besson (Leon, The Fifth Element) arrived at the "Yes Planet" theater in Ramat-Gan, Israel early afternoon, to attend the show. Right before the screening began, he asked the audience to open it's heart, and added something about the film being aimed mainly for kids. He was right.\n\nMaybe it's that bitter 26-year-old guy in me that just couldn't let go of that aching sarcasm that prevented me from really enjoying this half CGI animated/half live action film. Maybe it's the fact that i've just seen so many similar products through the course of my life, that I found it heard to be excited or (god forbid) enthusiastic during this one. Whatever the cause, I couldn't help but reaching the eventual conclusion that Arthur and the Minimoys didn't live up to it's potential. If Besson had just moved one step forward with his imagination, if the twists had been just a tad more original, if the ending hadn't felt so quick and rushed - I could have had a much better time.\n\nThe plot line is easy to follow: 10 year-old Arthur, played by Freddie Highmore of Charlie and the Chocolate fame, lives in a small town with his grandmother, portrayed by Mia Farrow (Rosemary's Baby, The Purple Rose of Cairo). It's the early 1960's and Arthur, who is neglected by his parents, escapes his loneliness by hearing stories of his absent grandfather's journeys to imaginative lands. Reality, however, is grim, as Grandpa has been missing for three years and Grandma must raise a large sum of money in 48 hours, or her land will be seized by the local authorities. Determined to save the property, Arthur sets out on a journey to the land of the Minimoys, extremely small beings who live in his garden, in search of expensive rubies that can put an end to Grandma's debts. From here on out the story turns CGI, as Arthur is shrinked to the size of an average Minimoy himself. On his journey, he falls in love with princess Selenia (voiced by Madonna), befriends a rastaman underground dweller named Max (Snoop Dog) and faces the evil being referred to as "M" (David Bowie). \n\nWhile the animation is colorful and filled with imagination, the plot moves so fast you don't have much time to really notice the details. Also, there are some supposedly subtle remarks about sex, marriage and corrupt leaders which I don't think are fully appropriate for kids.\n\nBottom Line, Arthur and the Minimoys is an OK ride, but nothing we haven't seen before. From the recent animated The Ant Bully, through the classic 1980's Honey I Shrunk the Kids, the famed story of King Arthur and even The Matrix - it's all homaged, if not copied, in this new entry.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34167,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Arthur and the Great Adventure was a rather messy sequel that made the same mistakes as its predecessor and made even more on its way. It does have some good things too. The backgrounds have some great detail and it is colourful to look at, so most of the animation is good. The soundtrack is bouncy and has an adventurous feel to it. Freddie Highmore is still likable in the title role while Mia Farrow is as kindly and compassionate as in the first film and Selena Gomez is an improvement over Madonna, actually sounding like a young princess and closer to Highmore's age rather than somebody trying to sound younger. The story is very thinly plotted though and reads a lot like filler, not helped also by very hyperactive pacing and an abrupt conclusion, which felt more like the start of a film than the end. Arthur's adventure and search is tiresome and takes too long to get going, and there is too much of the father character, an important character but not that important. The live action scenes are still awkwardly staged and don't mesh particularly well with the animated sequences, while the dialogue lacks freshness or flow with some ill-judged and timed comic relief. Maltarzard, one of the first film's stronger characters, is a very weak villain this time round, here a character that is under-utilised and underwritten. Jimmy Fallon is even more irritating here now the material is weaker, Snoop Dogg fares better but also struggles. Will.i.am is out of place, but the worst case was Lou Reed, who sounds really bored and monotone. No attempt whatsoever is made to make Maltarzard sound like he did in Arthur and the Invisibles, and his character design here might leave youngsters who saw this film without seeing the first traumatised. In conclusion, not a truly terrible film but really not that great or good either. 4/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8719,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is nothing like that.\n\nJack Black's Gulliver starts out in the real world of the present day, with a smart phone. That's all you really need to know about when this took place. \n\nHe's not happy with his life in the mail room, and he wants more. A relationship with travel writer Darcy, and more opportunities to do the real work of the New York Tribune.\n\nThe Internet makes things easy. When I was in high school and college, there was plagiarism, but it was more challenging because what we know today as the Internet didn't exist. Gulliver has an easy time impressing Darcy and gets sent to the Bermuda Triangle. Oh, so this is how it will work. \n\nAnd it's actually a pretty exciting scene as Gulliver gets sent into another dimension. Then he has the experience that Danson had, only funnier. This version of the story, pretty much limited to Lilliput, will go for laughs.\n\nAnd Lilliput is quite a complete nation, but with very small people compared to Gulliver. The castle where the royal family lives is huge. There is a city with lots of people, with varying ethnic backgrounds, and a countryside outside that city. And the Lilliputians have wars against other very small people from other nations.\n\nOnly after Gulliver shows his value in fighting a war is he treated with respect. He is a hero. And then things get quite silly. Every movie Gulliver has ever seen becomes a detail of his life, and pop culture references show up in abundance. We later see a giant R2D2 from "Star Wars", combined with "Transformers", used in battle, for example. All because Gulliver's plans for a video game become a fighting robot.\n\nMeanwhile, the prisoner Horatio vies with the nasty Edward for the heart of Princess Mary. Horatio is released only because Gulliver is his friend. \n\nThere is one scene where Mary is kidnapped, and I'm not sure whether it is atrocious writing or atrocious acting. No, it's actually brilliant writing and good acting, because most of the acting in this movie is quite good. I mean for the material. It takes real effort to make the acting look really bad. \n\nI am curious about one thing. Of course Gulliver loses cell phone service when he gets close to the Bermuda Triangle. How then is it possible he can receive the voice mails he missed--AFTER he crosses over? And these voice mails are quite important--if you think about it, there's an interesting plot twist coming. \n\nThe battle scenes are pretty impressive. I watch several CW super hero shows, and it's a lot like that. Even Horatio gets involved. \n\nThere is one cute scene in the world where everyone is big. It only has a little girl, who is quite big compared to Gulliver. Imagine what she would look like to Lilliputians. \n\nAnd the movie has a big musical number which is quite well done. Again, it seems silly to have the entire cast performing a song Gulliver likes. Also, the music here is quite old compared to, say, a romantic comedy starring teenagers. It comes closer to what I like. Let's say that.\n\nNo, it doesn't rank as the most impressive of the productions based on the literary work. No, it is not literary work on its own. But it is enjoyable and somewhat well done.

The first, and main problem, was the story. There were some times when it bared some resemblance to one of the best children's books ever written, up there with Peter Pan and the Hans Christian Anderson Fairy tales, for imagination and complexity. However, I especially disliked the dog meat factory subplot, that's where it got really clumsy and it made the climax feel really cluttered. The songs were also nothing to write home about. They were fun to listen to (especially the Weasel song), but they were definitely forgettable. The direction, by I think Terry Jones(also actor), lacked at times the director's usual silliness and fun. There were some scenes, like the train scene where the action felt a bit rushed. However, there were a number of redeeming qualities to the film. Some scenes, like the introduction to Rat, were beautifully shot, and reminded me of Three Men in a Boat. The sets and scenery are very colourful and pretty and the costumes didn't bother me all that much, admittedly though some of the special effects were so-so. The script was good, very witty at times, with some priceless lines especially with Toad, Badger and St John, while maintaining the book's gentleness and drollness which I liked. The performances were in general excellent especially Nicol Williamson as Badger, who brought a much needed gruffness to the character as well as having a gift for comedy. Steve Coogan was touching as Mole. Eric Idle and Terry Jones were very funny in their roles, Idle is wonderfully sympathetic and jovial while Jones has a ball as the juiciest character. The courtroom scene was hilarious because of Toad's increasingly silly breaking-into- song moments, and was the highlight of the film. John Cleese and Stephen Fry were good(Cleese especially), but their appearances were too brief. Anthony Sher was adequately menacing as Chief Weasel, but like everyone else involved, he has been better. All in all, a likable, colourful and funny but unfortunately at times clumsy film, with a 7/10.

This is nothing like that.\n\nJack Black's Gulliver starts out in the real world of the present day, with a smart phone. That's all you really need to know about when this took place. \n\nHe's not happy with his life in the mail room, and he wants more. A relationship with travel writer Darcy, and more opportunities to do the real work of the New York Tribune.\n\nThe Internet makes things easy. When I was in high school and college, there was plagiarism, but it was more challenging because what we know today as the Internet didn't exist. Gulliver has an easy time impressing Darcy and gets sent to the Bermuda Triangle. Oh, so this is how it will work. \n\nAnd it's actually a pretty exciting scene as Gulliver gets sent into another dimension. Then he has the experience that Danson had, only funnier. This version of the story, pretty much limited to Lilliput, will go for laughs.\n\nAnd Lilliput is quite a complete nation, but with very small people compared to Gulliver. The castle where the royal family lives is huge. There is a city with lots of people, with varying ethnic backgrounds, and a countryside outside that city. And the Lilliputians have wars against other very small people from other nations.\n\nOnly after Gulliver shows his value in fighting a war is he treated with respect. He is a hero. And then things get quite silly. Every movie Gulliver has ever seen becomes a detail of his life, and pop culture references show up in abundance. We later see a giant R2D2 from "Star Wars", combined with "Transformers", used in battle, for example. All because Gulliver's plans for a video game become a fighting robot.\n\nMeanwhile, the prisoner Horatio vies with the nasty Edward for the heart of Princess Mary. Horatio is released only because Gulliver is his friend. \n\nThere is one scene where Mary is kidnapped, and I'm not sure whether it is atrocious writing or atrocious acting. No, it's actually brilliant writing and good acting, because most of the acting in this movie is quite good. I mean for the material. It takes real effort to make the acting look really bad. \n\nI am curious about one thing. Of course Gulliver loses cell phone service when he gets close to the Bermuda Triangle. How then is it possible he can receive the voice mails he missed--AFTER he crosses over? And these voice mails are quite important--if you think about it, there's an interesting plot twist coming. \n\nThe battle scenes are pretty impressive. I watch several CW super hero shows, and it's a lot like that. Even Horatio gets involved. \n\nThere is one cute scene in the world where everyone is big. It only has a little girl, who is quite big compared to Gulliver. Imagine what she would look like to Lilliputians. \n\nAnd the movie has a big musical number which is quite well done. Again, it seems silly to have the entire cast performing a song Gulliver likes. Also, the music here is quite old compared to, say, a romantic comedy starring teenagers. It comes closer to what I like. Let's say that.\n\nNo, it doesn't rank as the most impressive of the productions based on the literary work. No, it is not literary work on its own. But it is enjoyable and somewhat well done. If you're the type of person who can enjoy Jack Black, you will probably like this."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66807,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is nothing like that.\n\nJack Black's Gulliver starts out in the real world of the present day, with a smart phone. That's all you really need to know about when this took place. \n\nHe's not happy with his life in the mail room, and he wants more. A relationship with travel writer Darcy, and more opportunities to do the real work of the New York Tribune.\n\nThe Internet makes things easy. When I was in high school and college, there was plagiarism, but it was more challenging because what we know today as the Internet didn't exist. Gulliver has an easy time impressing Darcy and gets sent to the Bermuda Triangle. Oh, so this is how it will work. \n\nAnd it's actually a pretty exciting scene as Gulliver gets sent into another dimension. Then he has the experience that Danson had, only funnier. This version of the story, pretty much limited to Lilliput, will go for laughs.\n\nAnd Lilliput is quite a complete nation, but with very small people compared to Gulliver. The castle where the royal family lives is huge. There is a city with lots of people, with varying ethnic backgrounds, and a countryside outside that city. And the Lilliputians have wars against other very small people from other nations.\n\nOnly after Gulliver shows his value in fighting a war is he treated with respect. He is a hero. And then things get quite silly. Every movie Gulliver has ever seen becomes a detail of his life, and pop culture references show up in abundance. We later see a giant R2D2 from "Star Wars", combined with "Transformers", used in battle, for example. All because Gulliver's plans for a video game become a fighting robot.\n\nMeanwhile, the prisoner Horatio vies with the nasty Edward for the heart of Princess Mary. Horatio is released only because Gulliver is his friend. \n\nThere is one scene where Mary is kidnapped, and I'm not sure whether it is atrocious writing or atrocious acting. No, it's actually brilliant writing and good acting, because most of the acting in this movie is quite good. I mean for the material. It takes real effort to make the acting look really bad. \n\nI am curious about one thing. Of course Gulliver loses cell phone service when he gets close to the Bermuda Triangle. How then is it possible he can receive the voice mails he missed--AFTER he crosses over? And these voice mails are quite important--if you think about it, there's an interesting plot twist coming. \n\nThe battle scenes are pretty impressive. I watch several CW super hero shows, and it's a lot like that. Even Horatio gets involved. \n\nThere is one cute scene in the world where everyone is big. It only has a little girl, who is quite big compared to Gulliver. Imagine what she would look like to Lilliputians. \n\nAnd the movie has a big musical number which is quite well done. Again, it seems silly to have the entire cast performing a song Gulliver likes. Also, the music here is quite old compared to, say, a romantic comedy starring teenagers. It comes closer to what I like. Let's say that.\n\nNo, it doesn't rank as the most impressive of the productions based on the literary work. No, it is not literary work on its own. But it is enjoyable and somewhat well done. If you're the type of person who can enjoy Jack Black, you will probably like this.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66807,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'll try my best to be objective in this review, though. The plot is good, and as the film barely takes 90 minutes it's fairly fast-paced(well, for a Jim Carrey comedy, anyway); I don't think there ever passes 5 minutes without one single joke. The acting is fairly good; Jim Carrey is in his element, so it's no surprise that he's good, but I did find both Maura Tierney and Cary Elwes pretty good too. I know that Elwes is English, not American, and after seeing another movie in which he has a strong English accent(Robin Hood: Men in Tights), I was impressed at how well he does American parts as well. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is great, partly because it's, well, Carrey, but also because unlike some of Carrey's previous roles, this is fairly "clean", so teenagers and some kids will be able to enjoy it as well. The theme of the film is great; I mean, we all know that we lie several times a day(heck, it's even been scientifically proved), but what about if we, for one whole day, couldn't tell one single lie? Great theme, provokes some thought and is executed fairly well in the film, though I do think it could have been done a tad better. Overall, I don't have any major complaints with the film though; I guess it could be argued that most of what Carrey does in this film, the comedy and all, is stuff he's done before, but that's OK; it's not any less entertaining here, regardless of the fact that we've seen it(or something similar to it) earlier. The dialog is great, with some very memorable and quotable lines. All in all, a typical Carrey film, which can be a good thing as well as bad; Carrey does exactly what you expect him to, and he's very entertaining and all, but it never transcends the standard level of the typical Carrey comedy. On a final note, I think this(as well as his other work) proves that Tom Shadyac is the best there is at bringing out Carrey's talents(he also directed Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Bruce Almighty). I recommend it to any fan of Jim Carrey and/or Tom Shadyac. 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":288855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nicholson and Hunt both won Oscars and they're simply great but Kinnear is no less effective as Nicholson gay neighbour. Plus that dog is amazing as well. This film really relies on great performances and there's no shortage of that here.\n\nAs Good As It Gets is also remarkably well written. So well defined characters and completely involving, you quite simply grow to love them and sympathize with their plight. Nicholson's remarks are terrific, each one very quotable (personal fav; I think of a man and I take away reason and accountability).\n\nDirection is first rate, Brooks made Terms of Endearment so it's well established that he's quite capable of making great films. As Good As It Gets is very nearly as good it gets.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":281445,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's not just a comedy, you can't quite label it a drama piece, it just is what it is; simply great.\n\nWhat works here so well are the actors and the script. Nicholson and Hunt both won Oscars and they're simply great but Kinnear is no less effective as Nicholson gay neighbour. Plus that dog is amazing as well. This film really relies on great performances and there's no shortage of that here.\n\nAs Good As It Gets is also remarkably well written. So well defined characters and completely involving, you quite simply grow to love them and sympathize with their plight. Nicholson's remarks are terrific, each one very quotable (personal fav; I think of a man and I take away reason and accountability).\n\nDirection is first rate, Brooks made Terms of Endearment so it's well established that he's quite capable of making great films. As Good As It Gets is very nearly as good it gets.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":281445,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT2H19M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Everyone I had spoken to that had seen it had told me that this film was terrible. Every review I had read about it says it is really bad  but my attitude towards it was "How bad can it be?". The truth is  I actually quite enjoyed it.\n\nThe movie is based on an old TV show of the same name. 2 police officers are forced to work with each other, but they are both completely different to each other. They are trying to hunt down a drug dealer that has some cocaine in his possession that is completely undetectable. Not even the police dogs can smell it.\n\nThe comedy in this movie is not great. I laughed out loud once throughout the entire movie. But that is not to say it was not funny. There were a few moments in the film that made me smile and I thought were entertaining. I do wish it was funnier though. The story was quite good, but nothing we have not seen a million times before in buddy cop movies.\n\nThe action as really good in places. The car chases were really good and the stunts reminded me of watching the classic TV shows that I loved as a kid, Knight Rider and the Dukes of Hazzard. It was great to see the old red Gran Torino with the white stripe along the side. I love that car  I don't really remember it from TV as I never watched the show, but I know the car. During the credits at the end, you can see some of the car stunts that go wrong during filming. These are awesome, but it is a shame to see the lovely cars getting smashed up.\n\nI like the actors in this movie. The film stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. These guys are funny guys, but sometimes it just doesn't work. I thought Ben played his part well and Owen played his part well too, but for some reason the chemistry between them both felt like something was missing. I could not imagine them as partners and even after watching them for 90 minutes, I still didn't really see them as partners. But nonetheless, they both did well and I enjoyed watching them. There were a lot of other famous faces in this film that I didn't know were in it  Snoop Dogg, Fred Williamson, Vince Vaughn, Juliette Lewis, Jason Bateman, Amy Smart, Carmen Electra and Chris Penn. Also I loved the cameo at the end from the original Starsky &amp; Hutch, David Soul &amp; Paul Michael Glaser from the TV show. I loved it and thought it was a great ending to the film.\n\nOK, so the film as a whole was not brilliant, the comedy was not up to par and the acting was not great in places, the story could have been better too but this was still really entertaining. It did not deserve the bashing by all the reviewers that it took.\n\nI will give this film 7 out of 10.\n\n"A floater. Nothing harder to solve than a floater. No prints, body's usually bloated, it's next to impossible. All right, I say we push it out and hope the current pushes it down to the next precinct."\n\nFor more reviews, please like my Facebook page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140541,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was great to see the old red Gran Torino with the white stripe along the side. I love that car  I don't really remember it from TV as I never watched the show, but I know the car. During the credits at the end, you can see some of the car stunts that go wrong during filming. These are awesome, but it is a shame to see the lovely cars getting smashed up.\n\nI like the actors in this movie. The film stars Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson. These guys are funny guys, but sometimes it just doesn't work. I thought Ben played his part well and Owen played his part well too, but for some reason the chemistry between them both felt like something was missing. I could not imagine them as partners and even after watching them for 90 minutes, I still didn't really see them as partners. But nonetheless, they both did well and I enjoyed watching them. There were a lot of other famous faces in this film that I didn't know were in it  Snoop Dogg, Fred Williamson, Vince Vaughn, Juliette Lewis, Jason Bateman, Amy Smart, Carmen Electra and Chris Penn. Also I loved the cameo at the end from the original Starsky &amp; Hutch, David Soul &amp; Paul Michael Glaser from the TV show. I loved it and thought it was a great ending to the film.\n\nOK, so the film as a whole was not brilliant, the comedy was not up to par and the acting was not great in places, the story could have been better too but this was still really entertaining. It did not deserve the bashing by all the reviewers that it took.\n\nI will give this film 7 out of 10.\n\n"A floater. Nothing harder to solve than a floater. No prints, body's usually bloated, it's next to impossible. All right, I say we push it out and hope the current pushes it down to the next precinct."\n\nFor more reviews, please like my Facebook page:\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140541,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Actually, despite a lazy script full of nonstop crude and sex jokes, and moments that could be really awful, this movie is above the very low bar. Jack Black and Michael Cera take this bad material and make something mediocre out of it, which still isn't saying much.\n\nZed (Jack Black) is a gatherer who tries to fit in with the hunter clan, but he's just too silly for their tastes. Oh (Michael Cera) is also a gatherer and is a somewhat unpopular with the ladies. After an accident involving fire, this mismatched pair has to leave and they do through various pieces of biblical history, including meeting Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd), and meeting Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Abraham (Hank Azaria), who apparently had a thing for cutting foreskin. The movie is a hodge podge of scenes thrown together with very little plot, but by the end Zed and Oh have to save the lives of two girls from their village.\n\nJack Black and Michael Cera are pretty good here. Jack Black does his typical over the top stoner performance and Michael Cera gives the emotional boy performance. Even David Cross and Oliver Platt manage to squeeze some laughs out of their performances. But nobody really has a lot of material to work with, though at the same time the material isn't the worst out there. It's bad, and oftentimes relies on some outwardly sexual material. In fact, this is the least subtle PG-13 rated film I've seen where sexual or crude jokes are involved. This includes scenes of eating poop and throwing testicles. If something sexual happens, it's not only just implied, but it's flaunted.\n\nOne big problem is the lack of plot in the movie. It grows boring going from setpiece to setpiece, never establishing a real plot until the end, and despite being only around 100 minutes, it still feels way too long. The climax is ridiculous and quite boring, and this movie is too filled with scenes that aren't particularly horrible, but they aren't particularly funny, and all too often this movie is just a laugh free staring at the screen. It managed to attain quite consistent mediocrity, with some chuckles every once in a while. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't good either, by any means.\n\nMy rating: ** out of ****. 105 mins.

He became a hit actor in the likes of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective (a personal childhood favourite), The Mask and Dumb and Dumber. He tried hard for an Oscar nom, but always contended with winning Golden Globes. And for years now, he has basically been bouncing around dramas, comedies, and dramedies. So now, he has tackled a remake (of a comedy no less), and the results as per the last few years, are mixed at best.\n\nCarrey is Dick, an employee at Globodyne (read: Enron) who is promoted just in time to help sail the company into oblivion on television. He tells his wife Jane (Tea Leoni) to leave her job only hours before hand, and upon returning stunning home, realizes that he may be in a bit of trouble. As the months go on, the pair's assets slowly begin to dwindle, and hope for continued survival begins to evaporate. So with nothing left to do, they turn to life of petty crime and hope for the best.\n\nIt is not an original concept at all, but Carrey and Leoni do a valiant job keeping this boat floating. While the film does have a few hilarious moments, the rest of it is bogged down by mere snicker-filled sequences or just scenes that are totally unfunny. It's not like these two actors are having any trouble being funny, it's that the material is not funny. Judd Apatow did wonders with The 40-Year-Old Virgin, but he fumbles here pretty hard with his writing partner Nicholas Stoller, who does not have nearly enough credits to his name. A parody on what happened at Enron was inevitable, but this just seems lackluster and barely thought out. Subplots are brought in, but barely resolved, and the key storyline just feels very weak by the end. It's not terrible, it just feels a tad bit incomplete.\n\nThe sorry thing about the entire film is the fact that much of it just feels like an extended montage with little payoff. It is only ninety minutes long, so it feels like a lot was trimmed down or cut right out. But the film suffers as a result. If it was longer, it undoubtedly could have had more potential for more funny moments, and as a whole, feel more complete.\n\nWhile Carrey and Leoni do their best, it's Leoni who gives a stronger performance. Yes, Carrey is right at home with his zany character, and totally overshadows Leoni in every single aspect. But he just lacks that integral element of human comedy here, that made him so famous in the first place. It's unfortunate, and makes me wonder if the old Carrey will ever return, or if we'll have to contend with semi-funny Carrey for the rest of his career. Leoni is much better, and feels more in tune with what she's doing. \n\nEven more unfortunate is the wasted supporting cast does very little. Alec Baldwin as the sleazy CEO Jack McCallister is sparingly unfunny, as is Richard Jenkins as the right hand man Frank Bascombe, who spends most of the movie drunk and not doing anything (besides setting up for the finale). The rest of the cast has little to no screen time, or are simply silly supporting characters that just feel like excess waste in the entire scheme of things.\n\nFor all of it's faults, the film is a worth while watch. As said, I did laugh at some of it. A bit of work on the screenplay would have benefited everyone here. Just do not go in expecting a comedy classic with Jim Carrey. If so, you will be sadly disappointed.\n\n6.5/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138632,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

New York cop Nicolas Cage does not have a tip for diner waitress Bridget Fonda so promises to split his earnings if he wins the state's lottery. Amazingly he does win. His share is $4 million and true to his word he gives half to Fonda to wife's Rosie Perez's dismay. Perez is the boss in a loveless marriage. Cage and Fonda then start to fall in love with each other and Perez decides to divorce Cage just out of spite and try to get the entire $4 million for herself. A really beautiful romantic film that works due to quiet, but highly effective performances by Cage and Fonda. Perez steals every scene here and the film's good screenplay makes it a nice success. 4 stars out of 5."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36808,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

New York cop Nicolas Cage does not have a tip for diner waitress Bridget Fonda so promises to split his earnings if he wins the state's lottery. Amazingly he does win. His share is $4 million and true to his word he gives half to Fonda to wife's Rosie Perez's dismay. Perez is the boss in a loveless marriage. Cage and Fonda then start to fall in love with each other and Perez decides to divorce Cage just out of spite and try to get the entire $4 million for herself. A really beautiful romantic film that works due to quiet, but highly effective performances by Cage and Fonda. Perez steals every scene here and the film's good screenplay makes it a nice success. 4 stars out of 5.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36808,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="de">Year One: Directed by Harold Ramis. With Jack Black, Michael Cera, Oliver Platt, David Cross.

Actually, despite a lazy script full of nonstop crude and sex jokes, and moments that could be really awful, this movie is above the very low bar. Jack Black and Michael Cera take this bad material and make something mediocre out of it, which still isn't saying much.\n\nZed (Jack Black) is a gatherer who tries to fit in with the hunter clan, but he's just too silly for their tastes. Oh (Michael Cera) is also a gatherer and is a somewhat unpopular with the ladies. After an accident involving fire, this mismatched pair has to leave and they do through various pieces of biblical history, including meeting Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd), and meeting Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Abraham (Hank Azaria), who apparently had a thing for cutting foreskin. The movie is a hodge podge of scenes thrown together with very little plot, but by the end Zed and Oh have to save the lives of two girls from their village.\n\nJack Black and Michael Cera are pretty good here. Jack Black does his typical over the top stoner performance and Michael Cera gives the emotional boy performance. Even David Cross and Oliver Platt manage to squeeze some laughs out of their performances. But nobody really has a lot of material to work with, though at the same time the material isn't the worst out there. It's bad, and oftentimes relies on some outwardly sexual material. In fact, this is the least subtle PG-13 rated film I've seen where sexual or crude jokes are involved. This includes scenes of eating poop and throwing testicles. If something sexual happens, it's not only just implied, but it's flaunted.\n\nOne big problem is the lack of plot in the movie. It grows boring going from setpiece to setpiece, never establishing a real plot until the end, and despite being only around 100 minutes, it still feels way too long. The climax is ridiculous and quite boring, and this movie is too filled with scenes that aren't particularly horrible, but they aren't particularly funny, and all too often this movie is just a laugh free staring at the screen. It managed to attain quite consistent mediocrity, with some chuckles every once in a while. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't good either, by any means.\n\nMy rating: ** out of ****. 105 mins. PG-13 for crude sexual humor, drug use, and language.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94936,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-08-12","keywords":"horniness,sodom,cain and abel,biblical satire,prehistory","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Year One: Superbowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2134442777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjI0MDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzODkyMg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjI0MDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzODkyMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the Year One commercial which aired during the 2009 Superbowl."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085312/","name":"Jack Black"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1312575/","name":"Olivia Wilde"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035477/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1969144/","name":"Gene Stupnitsky"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1072409/","name":"Lee Eisenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One nasty road accident later, the annoyingly whiny female passenger of the car they just hit is dragged off into the woods by a mostly unseen creature which rips the woman to shreds - and good riddance. Ellie and Jimmy do not escape unscathed themselves. The creature has mildly injured them both and soon, brother and sister are experiencing heightened senses and suffering the Mark of the Beast on the palm of their hands. For Jimmy, it's a blessing in disguise as he returns to high school and battles the school bully. For Ellie, it's the first step on the path towards discovering who the real monster is, and the suspects are numerous. Will she and her brother discover the identity of the beast in time to save themselves from the curse? Or will they too become full fledged werewolves at the next full moon?\n\n"Cursed" doesn't take itself very seriously as a horror film, or as a comedy. It seems to be trying to decide which it wanted to be, and hadn't made up its mind in time for the closing credits. There are a few genuine laughs to be found throughout, and some nifty references to the bygone days of Universal Creature Features, but for the most part this is a silly, airbrushed effort, filled with Beautiful People acting stupidly. I should have considered myself warned when I saw Scott Baio's name in the opening credits. The werewolf itself has a few good scenes, but I was kind of disappointed to see the legendary Rick Baker's name in the credits, and then find myself face to face with a CGI beast later on. And what was Christina Ricci doing in this? Did she lose a bet with Wes Craven or something?\n\nThis film might have fared better in the 80s, but it seems somewhat lifeless and unimaginative these days. I'm just glad I had a free pass, otherwise I would be feeling profoundly ripped off right about now.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31037,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One nasty road accident later, the annoyingly whiny female passenger of the car they just hit is dragged off into the woods by a mostly unseen creature which rips the woman to shreds - and good riddance. Ellie and Jimmy do not escape unscathed themselves. The creature has mildly injured them both and soon, brother and sister are experiencing heightened senses and suffering the Mark of the Beast on the palm of their hands. For Jimmy, it's a blessing in disguise as he returns to high school and battles the school bully. For Ellie, it's the first step on the path towards discovering who the real monster is, and the suspects are numerous. Will she and her brother discover the identity of the beast in time to save themselves from the curse? Or will they too become full fledged werewolves at the next full moon?\n\n"Cursed" doesn't take itself very seriously as a horror film, or as a comedy. It seems to be trying to decide which it wanted to be, and hadn't made up its mind in time for the closing credits. There are a few genuine laughs to be found throughout, and some nifty references to the bygone days of Universal Creature Features, but for the most part this is a silly, airbrushed effort, filled with Beautiful People acting stupidly. I should have considered myself warned when I saw Scott Baio's name in the opening credits. The werewolf itself has a few good scenes, but I was kind of disappointed to see the legendary Rick Baker's name in the credits, and then find myself face to face with a CGI beast later on. And what was Christina Ricci doing in this? Did she lose a bet with Wes Craven or something?\n\nThis film might have fared better in the 80s, but it seems somewhat lifeless and unimaginative these days. I'm just glad I had a free pass, otherwise I would be feeling profoundly ripped off right about now.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31037,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was a direct continuation of the first, with several new layers added. The whole thing was one long moody and bloody action movie, nearly perfectly recapturing the mood from the first movie. The acting itself was a bit more intense in the first movie, I thought, while the sequel was perhaps slightly too fast-paced to give the characters much room.\n\nThe one thing where I felt the sequel fell short of my expectations was a part of the central plot. Underworld: Evolution was exciting and engaging, with much more and much deeper story than in the average action movie, but one of the key points did not satisfy. They spend almost the whole second half of the movie trying to locate the sarcophagus of the first werewolf. This is exciting, because you expect that something wild and interesting will happen when they find it. But... they find it, release the guy, fight him for a couple of minutes and kill him. That's it. Except for the fight, he doesn't have any real role to play in the story. That was a let-down. And a serious one.\n\nBut other than that I was quite satisfied. It was cool to see all that British talent, lending a touch of real class to the project!\n\nMy rating: 7 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":192062,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was a direct continuation of the first, with several new layers added. The whole thing was one long moody and bloody action movie, nearly perfectly recapturing the mood from the first movie. The acting itself was a bit more intense in the first movie, I thought, while the sequel was perhaps slightly too fast-paced to give the characters much room.\n\nThe one thing where I felt the sequel fell short of my expectations was a part of the central plot. Underworld: Evolution was exciting and engaging, with much more and much deeper story than in the average action movie, but one of the key points did not satisfy. They spend almost the whole second half of the movie trying to locate the sarcophagus of the first werewolf. This is exciting, because you expect that something wild and interesting will happen when they find it. But... they find it, release the guy, fight him for a couple of minutes and kill him. That's it. Except for the fight, he doesn't have any real role to play in the story. That was a let-down. And a serious one.\n\nBut other than that I was quite satisfied. It was cool to see all that British talent, lending a touch of real class to the project!\n\nMy rating: 7 out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":192062,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

To be honest, if it hadn't been for the return of Raze, I might not have given this a chance at all; Kevin Grevioux is just plain a bad-ass. That's his *real voice*! Seriously, listen to interviews with him. While I would have liked more of him in this, I'm honest enough to admit that the entire 80 minute running time could have had him in every shot, and I'd still be saying that it's not enough. For Tatopoulos having relatively little experience at directing(I guess he got tired of being consultant for when giant mutated lizards attack), he does rather well. And this definitely has a *gorgeous* Gothic look, and the dark tone of the first two. The cinematography and editing are great, and the use of hand-held is effective, although several bits go by so fast that you can't tell what is going on. Nearly every(and certainly every lead) performance is impressive; Sheen continues the stellar work, Nighy(apart from being over the top at points) is marvelous, of course, and I wouldn't mind seeing Mitra be the lead in something else. I hadn't seen her in this large a part before, and she does well. The action is cool, intense and fun; of course, given that this is a prequel, you may miss the shoot-outs and car-chases of the prior 2 entries. With that said, the sword-fighting is great. The FX are excellent, and smoothly integrated. To its credit, at its core, this is a story about slaves rising up against their masters, and it does engage pretty well. There is plenty of brutal, bloody violence, a little sexuality(hot, though not graphic; and this has eye candy for both genders) and brief male, infant nudity in this. The DVD comes with an informative and amusing commentary track, three well-done featurettes of 9, 20 and 13 minutes length, respectively, a music video and a handful of trailers. I recommend this to any fan of the franchise(and this is best watched after the others). 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153253,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Draper\n\nOne must see this movie with an innocent, to glean the full joy of this precious childhood fantasy in film. I had that privilege with my seventeen year old Niece, Allison. Ah, to be seventeen again. Such a magical age. But I digress, back to the movie.\n\nEvery frame in this dream like story is an oil brushed painting. This film is so visually beautiful it will take your breath away. From dodging cannon balls in pink cotton candy clouds, to sailing ships in the sky, and a live golden sprite called Tinkerbell, such imagery will carry the young at heart to Never Land, forever and a day. And the score sweeps to match the brush of such sights the eye beholds.\n\nThe script was actually pretty simple, but is it? The director, P.J. Hogan, chose to follow J. M. Barrie's book, a sweet little English Victorian children's fairy tale with adult overtones, that tells the story of Pan, the boy who never grows up. This memory is in the thought of every responsible adult, in a whimsical wisp of a dream that is nostalgia.\n\nSo the story is set, the imagery is magic, the music is perfect, but always, that is the easy part. The writer, director, and most importantly, the cast must pull off the story to make it really sing. This is after all just a movie, and it is dictated that a movie should be generally profitable. I care not one wit for this, as I seek a diversion from reality, and "Peter Pan" the movie took me to childhood's comfort. This cast really works.\n\nThere is Peter Pan of course. The Pan, the tempter at the bedroom window. Jeremy Sumpter is Peter Pan. He is a daunting young man, very athletic, and he has that melting smile of the mischievous boy that seems to affect the female heart. Yet, he is still a cocky cut-throat little soldier, ready to take on Hook and his band of pirates.\n\nJeremy finally breaks the mold, successfully, of middle aged gamine women who had played Pan in the past, and it is refreshing for sure to see Peter the way he should really be. As a young and brash boy, with dirty feet and hands, blond tousled hair, in one hand a sword, and in the other an acorn - a kiss, for Wendy. Jeremy as Peter has some rather heartbreaking moments that affected my male heart, and like all men, I suddenly felt a longing to be a lost boy.\n\nWendy's father sans Captain Hook, is traditionally one in the same, and this movie rendition is no different. The disciplinarian, and forbidden male dominator, Jason Isaacs perfectly portrays Wendy's Father and Captain Hook, in a delicious dichotomy of stodgy Victorian Dad and the vile evil villain of a pirate. Hook is not to be ignored for he is a key character in this tale. Hook is bad, but we can admire him. And for one moment, Wendy wants to be a pirate and join Hook and his motley crew, as "Red Handed Jill" - ah - a great pirate name, as Hook would remark with gusto.\n\nOlivia Williams is cast as Wendy's Mother. Olivia is one of the most beautiful women alive today. This is necessary, as she must impart a genetic note upon her daughter. Wendy is as beautiful too - just not quite grown up yet. Olivia as Mother of her kidnapped children, is heartbreaking, as night after night, she sleeps in their room, and insists the window be kept open for their return. And when they do, such joy, and Olivia's maternal instincts convince a stodgy husband to adopt the lost boys.\n\nThen there is the fairy sprite "Tinkerbell". She is a key player. Tink is the temptress, the reason Peter Pan stays young. Yet she holds faith in her magical wings and cements the story's chapters together. Tinkerbell is portrayed by the current French coquette that wishes to be Bridgett Bardot, Ludvine Sagnier, who has been seen in French films, in various states of undress. Oh, how perfect, because Tink is a nymph, a sprite, a fairy, and has no concept of "clothing." She is perfect for this role of jealous female as a golden spiteful insect. And you will believe you can fly, if sprinkled with her pixie dust.\n\nTo round out the cast, Smee is notable as Hook's comic relief, and Dame Redgrave as Wendy's Aunt adds a necessary Victorian touch, the little girl who plays Tiger Lilly is precious, the mermaids are menacing, and Wendy's brothers with the lost boys throw in the delicious little boy gang. Hook's pirate crew is truly funny and revolting at the same time. Tictoc the croc is really big, and a very real looking digital monster. And who could forget Nana, the Newfoundland nurse dog, who's own brand of protective mischief plays a part in the film.\n\nBut it is Wendy, precious and wise Wendy, that really, is what this tale is all about. A young girl on the cusp of womanhood. That is the most tender and fragile of times. She is in love for the first time in her life, with Peter - recalcitrant at parents and teachers authority. A budding beauty that seeks the freedom that Peter Pan gives. A most complex creature this nubile young lady. She is the focus of the story of Peter Pan.\n\nWhat female actress could fit the bill? Well the makers of the movie looked for someone perfect, interviewed some 300 girls, and in doing so, found the perfect Windy. Rachael Hurd-Wood is an unknown, just pre-teen English lass with lush and long light brown hair, big blue eyes, a body so demure in flannel nightgown, she has dimples and a slightly toothy grin framed by full promising red lips, and such wonderfully perfect cheekbones which mark a little girl as a future beautiful woman. Prior to Peter Pan, she only acted in school plays. She captured my heart and soul as she did Peter's.\n\nAnd now, because of this part, Rachael is Windy always and forever. She takes on the roll as mother to the lost boys in a touching caretaker way. Yet she is tomboyish and brave enough to sword fight both Pan and Hook. And Wendy is the conscience of civilization. When Peter tempts her "come with me . . . we will never, never, have to worry about grownup things again." Wendy looks at him sadly and remarks "never is an awfully long time." But then Peter smiles and then Wendy smiles, and suddenly we are flying above the rooftops of London in our pajamas to Never Land. Wow! That's love. That's magic. That is the lure of Never Land.\n\nIf as a parent, you are reticent to take your child to this wonderful film, it would be as if you would have prevented said offspring from seeing "The Wizard of Oz." You must share this story with them, as it has all the whimsy of childhood magic that an adult can participate in, with, and as if, a child.\n\nThis is a wonderful film.  One that adult and child can enjoy together. A true classic and I highly recommend it.  Oh, and while you are at it, buy Barrie's book as well, and read it to yourself and to your children, as Peter's shadow watches over you."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67946,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Olivia is one of the most beautiful women alive today. This is necessary, as she must impart a genetic note upon her daughter. Wendy is as beautiful too - just not quite grown up yet. Olivia as Mother of her kidnapped children, is heartbreaking, as night after night, she sleeps in their room, and insists the window be kept open for their return. And when they do, such joy, and Olivia's maternal instincts convince a stodgy husband to adopt the lost boys.\n\nThen there is the fairy sprite "Tinkerbell". She is a key player. Tink is the temptress, the reason Peter Pan stays young. Yet she holds faith in her magical wings and cements the story's chapters together. Tinkerbell is portrayed by the current French coquette that wishes to be Bridgett Bardot, Ludvine Sagnier, who has been seen in French films, in various states of undress. Oh, how perfect, because Tink is a nymph, a sprite, a fairy, and has no concept of "clothing." She is perfect for this role of jealous female as a golden spiteful insect. And you will believe you can fly, if sprinkled with her pixie dust.\n\nTo round out the cast, Smee is notable as Hook's comic relief, and Dame Redgrave as Wendy's Aunt adds a necessary Victorian touch, the little girl who plays Tiger Lilly is precious, the mermaids are menacing, and Wendy's brothers with the lost boys throw in the delicious little boy gang. Hook's pirate crew is truly funny and revolting at the same time. Tictoc the croc is really big, and a very real looking digital monster. And who could forget Nana, the Newfoundland nurse dog, who's own brand of protective mischief plays a part in the film.\n\nBut it is Wendy, precious and wise Wendy, that really, is what this tale is all about. A young girl on the cusp of womanhood. That is the most tender and fragile of times. She is in love for the first time in her life, with Peter - recalcitrant at parents and teachers authority. A budding beauty that seeks the freedom that Peter Pan gives. A most complex creature this nubile young lady. She is the focus of the story of Peter Pan.\n\nWhat female actress could fit the bill? Well the makers of the movie looked for someone perfect, interviewed some 300 girls, and in doing so, found the perfect Windy. Rachael Hurd-Wood is an unknown, just pre-teen English lass with lush and long light brown hair, big blue eyes, a body so demure in flannel nightgown, she has dimples and a slightly toothy grin framed by full promising red lips, and such wonderfully perfect cheekbones which mark a little girl as a future beautiful woman. Prior to Peter Pan, she only acted in school plays. She captured my heart and soul as she did Peter's.\n\nAnd now, because of this part, Rachael is Windy always and forever. She takes on the roll as mother to the lost boys in a touching caretaker way. Yet she is tomboyish and brave enough to sword fight both Pan and Hook. And Wendy is the conscience of civilization. When Peter tempts her "come with me . . . we will never, never, have to worry about grownup things again." Wendy looks at him sadly and remarks "never is an awfully long time." But then Peter smiles and then Wendy smiles, and suddenly we are flying above the rooftops of London in our pajamas to Never Land. Wow! That's love. That's magic. That is the lure of Never Land.\n\nIf as a parent, you are reticent to take your child to this wonderful film, it would be as if you would have prevented said offspring from seeing "The Wizard of Oz." You must share this story with them, as it has all the whimsy of childhood magic that an adult can participate in, with, and as if, a child.\n\nThis is a wonderful film.  One that adult and child can enjoy together. A true classic and I highly recommend it.  Oh, and while you are at it, buy Barrie's book as well, and read it to yourself and to your children, as Peter's shadow watches over you.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67946,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He did all his own stunts, being paired on screen with his one time trapeze partner Nick Cravat as his mute sidekick. In these days of CGI overkill it's refreshing to see smartly choreographed action set pieces with real people performing breathtaking feats of agility. The support cast is filled with familiar faces from the period all giving good value in their respective roles.\n\nThe whole enterprise is lavishly mounted and shot in glorious vivid Technicolor. This was possibly one of the last of this type before Cinemascope and widescreen in general became the norm. As mentioned previously, accuracy isn't an issue here. In the finale we encounter prototypes of Gatlin guns, tanks and flamethrowers among other things!\n\nI hadn't seen this since childhood, so I took the opportunity of catching it on the BBC at the weekend. With 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' still relatively fresh in my mind, it seemed appropriate to revisit this old classic. I'm happy to say that it's lost none of its appeal, quite the opposite in fact.

He did all his own stunts, being paired on screen with his one time trapeze partner Nick Cravat as his mute sidekick. In these days of CGI overkill it's refreshing to see smartly choreographed action set pieces with real people performing breathtaking feats of agility. The support cast is filled with familiar faces from the period all giving good value in their respective roles.\n\nThe whole enterprise is lavishly mounted and shot in glorious vivid Technicolor. This was possibly one of the last of this type before Cinemascope and widescreen in general became the norm. As mentioned previously, accuracy isn't an issue here. In the finale we encounter prototypes of Gatlin guns, tanks and flamethrowers among other things!\n\nI hadn't seen this since childhood, so I took the opportunity of catching it on the BBC at the weekend. With 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' still relatively fresh in my mind, it seemed appropriate to revisit this old classic. I'm happy to say that it's lost none of its appeal, quite the opposite in fact. Rollicking good fun - recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6050,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"1952-09-27","keywords":"psychotronic film,camp,man tied up,blindfold,walking underwater","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000044/","name":"Burt Lancaster","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186576/","name":"Nick Cravat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0058982/","name":"Eva Bartok"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0802563/","name":"Robert Siodmak"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136681/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452134/","name":"Roland Kibbee"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Draper\n\nOne must see this movie with an innocent, to glean the full joy of this precious childhood fantasy in film. I had that privilege with my seventeen year old Niece, Allison. Ah, to be seventeen again. Such a magical age. But I digress, back to the movie.\n\nEvery frame in this dream like story is an oil brushed painting. This film is so visually beautiful it will take your breath away. From dodging cannon balls in pink cotton candy clouds, to sailing ships in the sky, and a live golden sprite called Tinkerbell, such imagery will carry the young at heart to Never Land, forever and a day. And the score sweeps to match the brush of such sights the eye beholds.\n\nThe script was actually pretty simple, but is it? The director, P.J. Hogan, chose to follow J. M. Barrie's book, a sweet little English Victorian children's fairy tale with adult overtones, that tells the story of Pan, the boy who never grows up. This memory is in the thought of every responsible adult, in a whimsical wisp of a dream that is nostalgia.\n\nSo the story is set, the imagery is magic, the music is perfect, but always, that is the easy part. The writer, director, and most importantly, the cast must pull off the story to make it really sing. This is after all just a movie, and it is dictated that a movie should be generally profitable. I care not one wit for this, as I seek a diversion from reality, and "Peter Pan" the movie took me to childhood's comfort. This cast really works.\n\nThere is Peter Pan of course. The Pan, the tempter at the bedroom window. Jeremy Sumpter is Peter Pan. He is a daunting young man, very athletic, and he has that melting smile of the mischievous boy that seems to affect the female heart. Yet, he is still a cocky cut-throat little soldier, ready to take on Hook and his band of pirates.\n\nJeremy finally breaks the mold, successfully, of middle aged gamine women who had played Pan in the past, and it is refreshing for sure to see Peter the way he should really be. As a young and brash boy, with dirty feet and hands, blond tousled hair, in one hand a sword, and in the other an acorn - a kiss, for Wendy. Jeremy as Peter has some rather heartbreaking moments that affected my male heart, and like all men, I suddenly felt a longing to be a lost boy.\n\nWendy's father sans Captain Hook, is traditionally one in the same, and this movie rendition is no different. The disciplinarian, and forbidden male dominator, Jason Isaacs perfectly portrays Wendy's Father and Captain Hook, in a delicious dichotomy of stodgy Victorian Dad and the vile evil villain of a pirate. Hook is not to be ignored for he is a key character in this tale. Hook is bad, but we can admire him. And for one moment, Wendy wants to be a pirate and join Hook and his motley crew, as "Red Handed Jill" - ah - a great pirate name, as Hook would remark with gusto.\n\nOlivia Williams is cast as Wendy's Mother. Olivia is one of the most beautiful women alive today. This is necessary, as she must impart a genetic note upon her daughter. Wendy is as beautiful too - just not quite grown up yet. Olivia as Mother of her kidnapped children, is heartbreaking, as night after night, she sleeps in their room, and insists the window be kept open for their return. And when they do, such joy, and Olivia's maternal instincts convince a stodgy husband to adopt the lost boys.\n\nThen there is the fairy sprite "Tinkerbell". She is a key player. Tink is the temptress, the reason Peter Pan stays young. Yet she holds faith in her magical wings and cements the story's chapters together. Tinkerbell is portrayed by the current French coquette that wishes to be Bridgett Bardot, Ludvine Sagnier, who has been seen in French films, in various states of undress. Oh, how perfect, because Tink is a nymph, a sprite, a fairy, and has no concept of "clothing." She is perfect for this role of jealous female as a golden spiteful insect. And you will believe you can fly, if sprinkled with her pixie dust.\n\nTo round out the cast, Smee is notable as Hook's comic relief, and Dame Redgrave as Wendy's Aunt adds a necessary Victorian touch, the little girl who plays Tiger Lilly is precious, the mermaids are menacing, and Wendy's brothers with the lost boys throw in the delicious little boy gang. Hook's pirate crew is truly funny and revolting at the same time. Tictoc the croc is really big, and a very real looking digital monster. And who could forget Nana, the Newfoundland nurse dog, who's own brand of protective mischief plays a part in the film.\n\nBut it is Wendy, precious and wise Wendy, that really, is what this tale is all about. A young girl on the cusp of womanhood. That is the most tender and fragile of times. She is in love for the first time in her life, with Peter - recalcitrant at parents and teachers authority. A budding beauty that seeks the freedom that Peter Pan gives. A most complex creature this nubile young lady. She is the focus of the story of Peter Pan.\n\nWhat female actress could fit the bill? Well the makers of the movie looked for someone perfect, interviewed some 300 girls, and in doing so, found the perfect Windy. Rachael Hurd-Wood is an unknown, just pre-teen English lass with lush and long light brown hair, big blue eyes, a body so demure in flannel nightgown, she has dimples and a slightly toothy grin framed by full promising red lips, and such wonderfully perfect cheekbones which mark a little girl as a future beautiful woman. Prior to Peter Pan, she only acted in school plays. She captured my heart and soul as she did Peter's.\n\nAnd now, because of this part, Rachael is Windy always and forever. She takes on the roll as mother to the lost boys in a touching caretaker way. Yet she is tomboyish and brave enough to sword fight both Pan and Hook. And Wendy is the conscience of civilization. When Peter tempts her "come with me . . . we will never, never, have to worry about grownup things again." Wendy looks at him sadly and remarks "never is an awfully long time." But then Peter smiles and then Wendy smiles, and suddenly we are flying above the rooftops of London in our pajamas to Never Land. Wow! That's love. That's magic. That is the lure of Never Land.\n\nIf as a parent, you are reticent to take your child to this wonderful film, it would be as if you would have prevented said offspring from seeing "The Wizard of Oz." You must share this story with them, as it has all the whimsy of childhood magic that an adult can participate in, with, and as if, a child.\n\nThis is a wonderful film.  One that adult and child can enjoy together. A true classic and I highly recommend it.  Oh, and while you are at it, buy Barrie's book as well, and read it to yourself and to your children, as Peter's shadow watches over you."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67946,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Draper\n\nOne must see this movie with an innocent, to glean the full joy of this precious childhood fantasy in film. I had that privilege with my seventeen year old Niece, Allison. Ah, to be seventeen again. Such a magical age. But I digress, back to the movie.\n\nEvery frame in this dream like story is an oil brushed painting. This film is so visually beautiful it will take your breath away. From dodging cannon balls in pink cotton candy clouds, to sailing ships in the sky, and a live golden sprite called Tinkerbell, such imagery will carry the young at heart to Never Land, forever and a day. And the score sweeps to match the brush of such sights the eye beholds.\n\nThe script was actually pretty simple, but is it? The director, P.J. Hogan, chose to follow J. M. Barrie's book, a sweet little English Victorian children's fairy tale with adult overtones, that tells the story of Pan, the boy who never grows up. This memory is in the thought of every responsible adult, in a whimsical wisp of a dream that is nostalgia.\n\nSo the story is set, the imagery is magic, the music is perfect, but always, that is the easy part. The writer, director, and most importantly, the cast must pull off the story to make it really sing. This is after all just a movie, and it is dictated that a movie should be generally profitable. I care not one wit for this, as I seek a diversion from reality, and "Peter Pan" the movie took me to childhood's comfort. This cast really works.\n\nThere is Peter Pan of course. The Pan, the tempter at the bedroom window. Jeremy Sumpter is Peter Pan. He is a daunting young man, very athletic, and he has that melting smile of the mischievous boy that seems to affect the female heart. Yet, he is still a cocky cut-throat little soldier, ready to take on Hook and his band of pirates.\n\nJeremy finally breaks the mold, successfully, of middle aged gamine women who had played Pan in the past, and it is refreshing for sure to see Peter the way he should really be. As a young and brash boy, with dirty feet and hands, blond tousled hair, in one hand a sword, and in the other an acorn - a kiss, for Wendy. Jeremy as Peter has some rather heartbreaking moments that affected my male heart, and like all men, I suddenly felt a longing to be a lost boy.\n\nWendy's father sans Captain Hook, is traditionally one in the same, and this movie rendition is no different. The disciplinarian, and forbidden male dominator, Jason Isaacs perfectly portrays Wendy's Father and Captain Hook, in a delicious dichotomy of stodgy Victorian Dad and the vile evil villain of a pirate. Hook is not to be ignored for he is a key character in this tale. Hook is bad, but we can admire him. And for one moment, Wendy wants to be a pirate and join Hook and his motley crew, as "Red Handed Jill" - ah - a great pirate name, as Hook would remark with gusto.\n\nOlivia Williams is cast as Wendy's Mother. Olivia is one of the most beautiful women alive today. This is necessary, as she must impart a genetic note upon her daughter. Wendy is as beautiful too - just not quite grown up yet. Olivia as Mother of her kidnapped children, is heartbreaking, as night after night, she sleeps in their room, and insists the window be kept open for their return. And when they do, such joy, and Olivia's maternal instincts convince a stodgy husband to adopt the lost boys.\n\nThen there is the fairy sprite "Tinkerbell". She is a key player. Tink is the temptress, the reason Peter Pan stays young. Yet she holds faith in her magical wings and cements the story's chapters together. Tinkerbell is portrayed by the current French coquette that wishes to be Bridgett Bardot, Ludvine Sagnier, who has been seen in French films, in various states of undress. Oh, how perfect, because Tink is a nymph, a sprite, a fairy, and has no concept of "clothing." She is perfect for this role of jealous female as a golden spiteful insect. And you will believe you can fly, if sprinkled with her pixie dust.\n\nTo round out the cast, Smee is notable as Hook's comic relief, and Dame Redgrave as Wendy's Aunt adds a necessary Victorian touch, the little girl who plays Tiger Lilly is precious, the mermaids are menacing, and Wendy's brothers with the lost boys throw in the delicious little boy gang. Hook's pirate crew is truly funny and revolting at the same time. Tictoc the croc is really big, and a very real looking digital monster. And who could forget Nana, the Newfoundland nurse dog, who's own brand of protective mischief plays a part in the film.\n\nBut it is Wendy, precious and wise Wendy, that really, is what this tale is all about. A young girl on the cusp of womanhood. That is the most tender and fragile of times. She is in love for the first time in her life, with Peter - recalcitrant at parents and teachers authority. A budding beauty that seeks the freedom that Peter Pan gives. A most complex creature this nubile young lady. She is the focus of the story of Peter Pan.\n\nWhat female actress could fit the bill? Well the makers of the movie looked for someone perfect, interviewed some 300 girls, and in doing so, found the perfect Windy. Rachael Hurd-Wood is an unknown, just pre-teen English lass with lush and long light brown hair, big blue eyes, a body so demure in flannel nightgown, she has dimples and a slightly toothy grin framed by full promising red lips, and such wonderfully perfect cheekbones which mark a little girl as a future beautiful woman. Prior to Peter Pan, she only acted in school plays. She captured my heart and soul as she did Peter's.\n\nAnd now, because of this part, Rachael is Windy always and forever. She takes on the roll as mother to the lost boys in a touching caretaker way. Yet she is tomboyish and brave enough to sword fight both Pan and Hook. And Wendy is the conscience of civilization. When Peter tempts her "come with me . . . we will never, never, have to worry about grownup things again." Wendy looks at him sadly and remarks "never is an awfully long time." But then Peter smiles and then Wendy smiles, and suddenly we are flying above the rooftops of London in our pajamas to Never Land. Wow! That's love. That's magic. That is the lure of Never Land.\n\nIf as a parent, you are reticent to take your child to this wonderful film, it would be as if you would have prevented said offspring from seeing "The Wizard of Oz." You must share this story with them, as it has all the whimsy of childhood magic that an adult can participate in, with, and as if, a child.\n\nThis is a wonderful film.  One that adult and child can enjoy together. A true classic and I highly recommend it.  Oh, and while you are at it, buy Barrie's book as well, and read it to yourself and to your children, as Peter's shadow watches over you.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67946,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He's a surgeon from sophisticated, worldly London who moves to (fictional) Portwenn on the coast of Cornwall because he suddenly becomes ill at the sight of blood. This is not a good omen for a surgeon. He quits to become a general practitioner and he's satisfied, thanks very much, with checkups, prescriptions and referrals.\n\nThe foul-mannered, blunt-spoken Doc smugly considers himself above the crowd, but he soon learns he is really BELOW the crowd, out of step with Portwenn's eccentricities, value systems and peculiar burghers, who make the mere lunatics of London look normal by comparison.\n\nMartin Clunes is terrific in the lead role. He is a tall, charismatic and not exactly handsome actor who looks like he would be more comfortable playing cops and heavies. He is, instead, a consummate comic actor. His facial and physical comedy, his frequent bouts of exasperation and bewilderment, are things to behold. (Note: some wags have compared him to 'House,' from the popular TV drama of the same name. House is played by Hugh Laurie, another splendid Brit, and that's about where the comparison begins and ends. They are two very different characters in two very different shows.)\n\nPortwenn's local population, with its twisted logic that somehow makes perfect sense, is represented through the tour-de-force acting of supporting players: Bert (Ian McNeice, who always dazzles playing offbeat, world-weary philosophical characters); Louise (the charming and beautiful Caroline Catz), who either loves Martin or wants to kill him; corn-rowed Elaine (lovely Lucy Punch) as the ditzy assistant with her own set of secretarial ethics; and Doc's Aunt Joan (the great Stephanie Cole, who has been delighting audiences since the 1960s).\n\nDominic Minghella, he of the Minghella mob of talented artists (brother Anthony directed 'The English Patient'), is the brains behind this brilliant controlled chaos.\n\nDon't miss this program. TV shows that are both funny AND intelligent are the rarest of TV fare.\n\nAnd a fast footnote: let us all bow our heads and pray that Hollywood doesn't try to remake this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Do not see this movie.\n\nGreen Zone was a very surprising experience for me. I was on the way to the cinema expecting, as several posters quoted, 'Born goes epic'. Instead, I got a nice combination of politics, moral dilemmas, and maybe even some very light philosophy.\n\nThe film takes a popular, but still a controversial &amp; for many people shameful, view on the Iraq war. The plot is complex but relatively easy to follow thanks to a(sometimes too) straight-forward set up, good directing, and sensible scene sequences. The plot does not bring you any traditional action flick twists and rarely pushes you to the edge of the seat, but makes up for it by making you think about some of the more real and worrying aspects of war and politics. The characters could have used some more development and dynamic, but on the bright side it was nice to not have every single thing rotate around Bourne. On the contrary, throughout the whole movie the focus was on a wider picture rather than on any of the more specific details in the story itself. It was nice to see the lines between bad &amp; good drawn in such a blurry manner. I was confused and indecisive in labelling characters as on the goody or the baddie side. The plot had an interesting ending, slightly ruined by a cheesy line from one of the characters, but brilliantly made up for by a fantastic scene of Baghdad at night. I found that whilst the epilogue of the movie was needed to explain consequences, something like a few sentences appearing on a black screen would have finished the movie in a much nicer mood than that in which it finished in reality. The plot took up an intellectual viewpoint on the Iraq war and gave me something to think about on the subject of both the Iraq war and the idea of war in general. This was something that you rarely see in movies like this, and made the movie the enjoyable experience that it is.\n\nThe directing &amp; cinematography in the movie were nothing special. Several style ideas were re-used from the Bourne movies, and action was not always as gripping as one might want, or at least expect. However, it was never bad either - all sequences kept a consistent standard of dialogue, special effects, and the little action that there was.\n\nThe acting in the movie was one of the few things that I expected. Matt Damon delivered his usual performance: a cool, in-control soldier committed to get to the bottom of things. The supporting actors all delivered their parts well enough, with Greg Kinnear holding his usual cunning, conniving, corrupt, money-thirsty politician role. However, because, as mentioned before, the film focused on a wider picture, the acting did not put me off the movie in any way whatsoever.

Do not see this movie.\n\nGreen Zone was a very surprising experience for me. I was on the way to the cinema expecting, as several posters quoted, 'Born goes epic'. Instead, I got a nice combination of politics, moral dilemmas, and maybe even some very light philosophy.\n\nThe film takes a popular, but still a controversial &amp; for many people shameful, view on the Iraq war. The plot is complex but relatively easy to follow thanks to a(sometimes too) straight-forward set up, good directing, and sensible scene sequences. The plot does not bring you any traditional action flick twists and rarely pushes you to the edge of the seat, but makes up for it by making you think about some of the more real and worrying aspects of war and politics. The characters could have used some more development and dynamic, but on the bright side it was nice to not have every single thing rotate around Bourne. On the contrary, throughout the whole movie the focus was on a wider picture rather than on any of the more specific details in the story itself. It was nice to see the lines between bad &amp; good drawn in such a blurry manner. I was confused and indecisive in labelling characters as on the goody or the baddie side. The plot had an interesting ending, slightly ruined by a cheesy line from one of the characters, but brilliantly made up for by a fantastic scene of Baghdad at night. I found that whilst the epilogue of the movie was needed to explain consequences, something like a few sentences appearing on a black screen would have finished the movie in a much nicer mood than that in which it finished in reality. The plot took up an intellectual viewpoint on the Iraq war and gave me something to think about on the subject of both the Iraq war and the idea of war in general. This was something that you rarely see in movies like this, and made the movie the enjoyable experience that it is.\n\nThe directing &amp; cinematography in the movie were nothing special. Several style ideas were re-used from the Bourne movies, and action was not always as gripping as one might want, or at least expect. However, it was never bad either - all sequences kept a consistent standard of dialogue, special effects, and the little action that there was.\n\nThe acting in the movie was one of the few things that I expected. Matt Damon delivered his usual performance: a cool, in-control soldier committed to get to the bottom of things. The supporting actors all delivered their parts well enough, with Greg Kinnear holding his usual cunning, conniving, corrupt, money-thirsty politician role. However, because, as mentioned before, the film focused on a wider picture, the acting did not put me off the movie in any way whatsoever. The one other thing which the movie lacked almost entirely throughout was humour. It's always nice to get a giggle in between moral implications and people dying all over the place.\n\nI have given the movie 7 out of 10 in total, with seven points for wider plot depth, intellectual aspects, directing &amp; cinematography, CGI &amp; special effects, and the last three points deduced for acting, immediate plot depth, action sequences, and humour, or rather the lack of it. It's a pleasant and original surprise, and something that will make you think after leaving the cinema.\n\nMK","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134093,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-03-17","keywords":"political military conspiracy,interrogation by torture,american,female reporter,speech","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Zone: International Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi447415577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4NDIwMzQyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4NDIwMzQyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Discovering covert and faulty intelligence causes a U.S. Army officer (Damon) to go rogue as he hunts for Weapons on Mass Destruction in an unstable region.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005042/","name":"Jason Isaacs","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339030/","name":"Paul Greengrass"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2418487/","name":"Rajiv Chandrasekaran"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I thought Jaimie Alexander was great and demonstrated her talent in this role more than I've seen from her in past roles such as Thor and The Brink. Sullivan Stapleton's acting was admittedly a little wooden in the pilot, but I liked his tough guy persona in Strike Back &amp; think he'll grow into this role with time also.

I thought Jaimie Alexander was great and demonstrated her talent in this role more than I've seen from her in past roles such as Thor and The Brink. Sullivan Stapleton's acting was admittedly a little wooden in the pilot, but I liked his tough guy persona in Strike Back &amp; think he'll grow into this role with time also. Yes, the story line is completely far-fetched and unrealistic. Yes, the plot does borrow from different formulas we've seen before, but not in a way that's a total rip off from other movies or TV. It doesn't have the originality of Mr Robot or the grittiness of True Detective, but it's fun popcorn entertainment.

However I wonder about that since it received no mention and as a minimum, Tatiana Maslany's performance in the lead character role is one of the best ever in any media. Tatiana plays the multiple clones effortlessly. Whether American, British, Eastern European, anti-social, nonconformist, conformist, straight, LGBTQ I am never questioning the character. I was a fan and regular viewer of United States of Tara, but Tatiana's performance eclipses Toni Collette's. As I watched each week of the first season, I went from mildly entertained by her transformation to completely believing there were multiple actresses in the show. I would watch the opening credits thinking there were missing actresses! Jordan Gavaris is also great as Tatiana's brother. He brings just the right level of doubt yet support to the character. The story lines, settings, direction are also very good. As video science fiction, I think this is one of the best shows I have seen. It explores many different ethic and moral views - personal, scientific and social - with just enough creepiness to both entertain and make me think.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":105233,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-03-30","keywords":"female protagonist,suicide,brainwashed assassin,mad scientist,genetic enhancement","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1137209/","name":"Tatiana Maslany","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1851313/","name":"Dylan Bruce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2849998/","name":"Jordan Gavaris"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069372/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1528935/","name":"Kim Coghill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3784672/","name":"Andrew De Angelis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3709826/","name":"Jeff Detsky"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Orphan Black - Season 3 teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1926017305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMzA2NzgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk3MDIwNTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyMzA2NzgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzk3MDIwNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sarah comes face to face with a new Castor clone in this sneak peek of Episode 1, which premieres Saturday, April 18th at 9/8c on BBC America."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
