It reminds me of Castle, the story about a father and a crime solving duo. The story lines are smooth and the comedy is natural. The most important thing here is that while it is being compared to classic shows, it has a present twist. From a personal point of few, this feels fresh to me and that's why I like it. I hope this as long run. After Castle ended, I had nothing of this genre to watch! A comedy, crime series helps in reviving my mood. Its not about the art, the originality nor the clichés for me, its about the successful characterisation which transcends the realm of the 2 dimensional television and plays out as a reality in my head. I'm giving 8/10 for just that. The show has managed to reach out to me and I would like to show my appreciation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3723,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His name certainly guarantees a bit of box office  attraction for his new Canadian series Private Eyes. \n\nI did a bit of a double take when I saw he was born in 1969 making him as I write this 49 years old. Granted he was no teen when he was playing one, but I have to say he looks pretty good for his age. We should all age so well.\n\nPriestley whom I remember on a long ago interview said he was a hockey player as a kid plays an ex-hockey player and is now trying to reinvent himself as a private detective. He works for Cindy Simpson who took over her dad's detective agency and he's come in as an operative.\n\nThe series has a Remington Steele like quality to it with the chemistry between Priestley and Simpson. Hopefully it will have as long a run as Remington Steele did.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3972,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-05-26","keywords":"hockey,body part in title,body part in series title,two word series title,two word title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000594/","name":"Jason Priestley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120797/","name":"Cindy Sampson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281284/","name":"Barry Flatman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150938/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2850421/","name":"Tim Kilby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0259275/","name":"Shelley Eriksen"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Private Eyes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi576699417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyZDgwYjYtYmU5Yy00NjdkLWIxZWMtNWMxMWUzZjZjYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyZDgwYjYtYmU5Yy00NjdkLWIxZWMtNWMxMWUzZjZjYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Private Eyes"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His name certainly guarantees a bit of box office  attraction for his new Canadian series Private Eyes. \n\nI did a bit of a double take when I saw he was born in 1969 making him as I write this 49 years old. Granted he was no teen when he was playing one, but I have to say he looks pretty good for his age. We should all age so well.\n\nPriestley whom I remember on a long ago interview said he was a hockey player as a kid plays an ex-hockey player and is now trying to reinvent himself as a private detective. He works for Cindy Simpson who took over her dad's detective agency and he's come in as an operative.\n\nThe series has a Remington Steele like quality to it with the chemistry between Priestley and Simpson. Hopefully it will have as long a run as Remington Steele did.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3972,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-05-26","keywords":"hockey,body part in title,body part in series title,two word series title,two word title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000594/","name":"Jason Priestley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120797/","name":"Cindy Sampson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281284/","name":"Barry Flatman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150938/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2850421/","name":"Tim Kilby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0259275/","name":"Shelley Eriksen"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Private Eyes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi576699417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyZDgwYjYtYmU5Yy00NjdkLWIxZWMtNWMxMWUzZjZjYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyZDgwYjYtYmU5Yy00NjdkLWIxZWMtNWMxMWUzZjZjYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Private Eyes"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His name certainly guarantees a bit of box office  attraction for his new Canadian series Private Eyes. \n\nI did a bit of a double take when I saw he was born in 1969 making him as I write this 49 years old. Granted he was no teen when he was playing one, but I have to say he looks pretty good for his age. We should all age so well.\n\nPriestley whom I remember on a long ago interview said he was a hockey player as a kid plays an ex-hockey player and is now trying to reinvent himself as a private detective. He works for Cindy Simpson who took over her dad's detective agency and he's come in as an operative.\n\nThe series has a Remington Steele like quality to it with the chemistry between Priestley and Simpson. Hopefully it will have as long a run as Remington Steele did.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3972,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-05-26","keywords":"hockey,body part in title,body part in series title,two word series title,two word title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000594/","name":"Jason Priestley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120797/","name":"Cindy Sampson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281284/","name":"Barry Flatman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150938/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2850421/","name":"Tim Kilby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0259275/","name":"Shelley Eriksen"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Private Eyes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi576699417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyZDgwYjYtYmU5Yy00NjdkLWIxZWMtNWMxMWUzZjZjYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmYyZDgwYjYtYmU5Yy00NjdkLWIxZWMtNWMxMWUzZjZjYTUzXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Private Eyes"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Gideon is saying that the human mind is the deadliest weapon of all, &amp; we are capable of anything &amp; everything of achieving all kinds of possibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Criminal Minds is the kind the of show that anyone can enjoy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":173540,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

 --- Description: Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit: Created by Dick Wolf. With Mariska Hargitay, Ice-T, Dann Florek, Richard Belzer. This series follows the Special Victims Unit, a specially trained squad of detectives in the N.Y.P.D., who investigate sexually related crimes." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt0203259/","name":"Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNlNjcwNGItOWRkNi00MzI0LTg3OGMtYzdjZDA4YmU4M2U1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODUxOTU0OTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"This series follows the Special Victims Unit, a specially trained squad of detectives in the N.Y.P.D., who investigate sexually related crimes.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0203259/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"stamper","dateCreated":"2005-01-25","inLanguage":"English","name":"Maybe the best crime-series at the moment and very underrated I feel","reviewBody":"When I am communicating with other people interested in crime series it is remarkable how many people seem to watch either CSI or CSI: Miami or both. Rarely (actually never) have I heard talk about this show, unless I brought it up myself and ended up discussing it with them. Of course I do not know the situation in America and other countries regarding this show, but I feel it is very underrated in the Netherlands. Of course this has a lot to do with it's programming spot. While CSI is usually on Saturday's at 8:30 or 9:30 p.m. and CSI: Miami on Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m., SVU's spot has been Sunday's around 11p.m. for quite some time now. That's hardly what I call a prime time spot. Just to compare I looked up the share's of those 3 shows on the internet. CSI has a share of 26 in the US and 17,5 in the Netherlands. For CSI:Miami these numbers are 15,0 and 13,2 and for SVU they are 17,0 and 7,7. This doesn't mean much, but once bring the number of households into it, it gets a lot clearer. CSI has about 18,6 million viewers in the US while CSI:Miami and SVU have 10,5 and 11,9 viewers respectively. In the Netherlands these figures are 1,175 million; 910 thousand and 370 thousand. This means that SVU has less than one-third of the viewers CSI has and MUCH less than half the viewers CSI: Miami has. In America SVU has two-thirds of the viewers of CSI and about 10% more than CSI:Miami. In my opinion this has a lot to do with the extremely bad programming spot SVU has gained in the Netherlands and the fact that the program is not advertised as vigorously as the two CSI's, for I feel it cannot have anything to do with it's quality.\n\nThe thing that makes SVU stand out so much in opinion, is that the stories depicted are very realistic and heart felt. I personally appreciate it very much, that there are no cheap attempts to make you cry by extending dramatic scenes or underscoring them with sad music. Mostly the sad parts happen quite suddenly and are relatively short. Maybe that's just another 'trick' to get you to cry without being as obvious as many soap opera's. TO me though, it makes the stories appeal much more life-like and truly gut-wrenching and sad.\n\nAlso all of the characters are good. If you watch long enough, you can get bits and pieces of information on everyone of them, thus discovering what makes them tick. I must admit that the series has changes it's emphasis a bit in recent years. In the first year there were numerous episode's that featured theme's or events from the investigator's home environment (especially Stabler's). This trend has somewhat diminished over the years, yet you can still see each individual's background shining through into their work ethics. One thin I really had to get used to was Richard Belzer's (Det. John Munch) role getting smaller. It seems to me that in the first few years of the series he was present much more and he made much more cynical remarks, something I really enjoyed. But overall the series has not changed for the worse, for I feel it has actually improved. While a few years ago I'd given this series an 8 out of 10 I'm much more inclined now to rate it even higher. What I've come to appreciate these last 2 or three years, were the additions of Ice-T (Det. Fin Tutuola), B.D. Wong (Dr. George Huang) and Stephanie March (A.D.A. Alex Cabbot) to the team. Stephanie March's character provides the viewer not only with an insight to what the D.A's job is, but her involvement in the series also shows what difficult decisions need to be made at times when the victim becomes the pursued or when a suspect cannot legally be brought to justice. Huang's intense involvement lately is in my opinion the biggest and best evolution the series has undergone (up until now). Not only because there have been few if any series which placed the work of the forensic psychiatrist is in the spotlight, but also it is much more realistic than for instance the media's depiction of profilers in The Silence of the Lambs or the TV-series Profiler. Also I think it is good (in addition to being very interesting) to show the public that not every offender is purely bad, but there is often much more when you go beyond the surface. As for Ice-T's character, I think he really completes the mix in the show, as the tough street cop. Him and Belzer are an ideal couple, just like Benson (Mariska Hargitay) and Stabler (Christopher Meloni).\n\nThe reasons, I personally feel SVU is the best crime series on the tube at the moment, are easily summarized. It has very much diversity, it offers insight into the psyche's of both victim's and perpetrators and it is realistic in every aspect. \n\n9 out of 10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-09-20","keywords":"shared universe,ampersand in title,punctuation in title,sexually motivated,sexually motivated assault","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002127/","name":"Mariska Hargitay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005221/","name":"Christopher Meloni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001384/","name":"Ice-T"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069685/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080319/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit - The Second Year","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3079995673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5NWEwMTMtYWYzMS00ZWNmLTk4N2EtNWZiZTA3NThkMzJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And he will do it ,even though it will be short-lived.(an admirable scene)\n\nUnfortunately , when you've got no child, you 're not "normal ": the quarrel during the grand-parents' golden wedding is revealing ,and François 's humiliation knows no bound .\n\nEllipsis is a common procedure in film narrative ,but here it's brilliantly used: ; after they've seen François rock the baby in his arms , there's no scene between the four protagonists of the affair ; Noémie ,the cheated wife ,waits to be home .\n\nRecommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-07","keywords":"paternity,wood,sawmill,husband wife relationship,infidelity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2478489881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NWQzNjEtYzkwZS00NTAyLWJmNjItZTczYTJiMGRkNjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NWQzNjEtYzkwZS00NTAyLWJmNjItZTczYTJiMGRkNjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504267/","name":"Jalil Lespert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2864046/","name":"Louise Bourgoin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235461/","name":"Mélanie Doutey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292833/","name":"Raphaël Jacoulot"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011118/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6940903/","name":"Benjamin Adam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8166889/","name":"Fadette Drouard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292833/","name":"Raphaël Jacoulot"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In general the movie feels like two movies stitched together harshly with only one plot line fully developed, the story of the main heroine (although in the first part of the movie she doesn't seem a main character). Acting overall is top notch and dialogue delivery is super real-like and despite at times unfitting soundtrack and too many close-up shots the movie pays too much attention to unnecessary dialogue and filler scenes and in the end it doesn't seem whole.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":780,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-28","keywords":"algeria,title directed by female,f rated,triple f rated,one word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1136312601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDcwODZmYmQtMjFjZS00N2IzLTkyZGEtNjJjODNlZDNkNDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDcwODZmYmQtMjFjZS00N2IzLTkyZGEtNjJjODNlZDNkNDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000272/","name":"Fanny Ardant","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308039/","name":"Louis Garrel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9860935/","name":"Dylan Robert"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494069/","name":"Maïwenn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049689/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0555809/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0218843/","name":"Mathieu Demy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494069/","name":"Maïwenn"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Past mid-point I started to ask myself when it would truly begin, for the story never felt intriguing to me, neither did the characters (although there were one or two scenes with Johnny Deep that were enjoyable). By the end of it I had to search for an explanation of the movie, on the internet, since I was convinced that I had missed some key elements somewhere; but no, to my big surprise I seemingly managed to stay focused enough to catch it all. So what is there to this movie?\n\nIn my opinion, it's very focused on delivering a message, so much that it takes away from what could have been at least somewhat of an interesting story; the message itself is clear not long after the beginning of the movie and once you get it, you've had it all.\n\nAnd what about my interest in history? Well, the movie takes place in "the Empire" and the soldiers came from "the capital", more than that I don't know. Some more action could've helped a little, but no, there's barely any action either to save it. You are in for a slow-paced movie, with a weak story and decent acting, trying to deliver a message.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8828,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-01-06","keywords":"loyalty,judge,screenplay adapted by author,barbarian","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2417147417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MmEzYTktYjRmOS00OWNmLTgxMmYtOGNlN2QwNmZhODYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MmEzYTktYjRmOS00OWNmLTgxMmYtOGNlN2QwNmZhODYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Magistrate of an isolated frontier settlement on the border of an unnamed empire looks forward to an easy retirement until the arrival of Colonel Joll, whose task it is to report on the activities of the "barbarians" and on the security situation on the border."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1458734/","name":"Ciro Guerra"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362409/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0200829/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168792/","name":"J.M.

Past mid-point I started to ask myself when it would truly begin, for the story never felt intriguing to me, neither did the characters (although there were one or two scenes with Johnny Deep that were enjoyable). By the end of it I had to search for an explanation of the movie, on the internet, since I was convinced that I had missed some key elements somewhere; but no, to my big surprise I seemingly managed to stay focused enough to catch it all. So what is there to this movie?\n\nIn my opinion, it's very focused on delivering a message, so much that it takes away from what could have been at least somewhat of an interesting story; the message itself is clear not long after the beginning of the movie and once you get it, you've had it all.\n\nAnd what about my interest in history? Well, the movie takes place in "the Empire" and the soldiers came from "the capital", more than that I don't know. Some more action could've helped a little, but no, there's barely any action either to save it. You are in for a slow-paced movie, with a weak story and decent acting, trying to deliver a message.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8828,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-01-06","keywords":"loyalty,judge,screenplay adapted by author,barbarian","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2417147417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MmEzYTktYjRmOS00OWNmLTgxMmYtOGNlN2QwNmZhODYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM4MmEzYTktYjRmOS00OWNmLTgxMmYtOGNlN2QwNmZhODYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Magistrate of an isolated frontier settlement on the border of an unnamed empire looks forward to an easy retirement until the arrival of Colonel Joll, whose task it is to report on the activities of the "barbarians" and on the security situation on the border.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1458734/","name":"Ciro Guerra"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362409/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0200829/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168792/","name":"J.M.

(I want to ask him if there's a reason why one of his themes sounds like "We Three Kings" gone awry.) I'm writing this comment primarily to respond to the wacky criticisms of LEMONY that I've been reading here on IMDb. Most fall into two categories: 1) people who don't "get" the movie and haven't read the books (and therefore are offended by its dark tone), or 2) adolescents who are obsessed with the books and are disappointed that their little dreams of how the movie should be haven't been perfectly realized (e.g., "the boy doesn't have glasses, so this movie stinks").\n\nLet me address the second group. WAKE UP!! The Lemony Snicket books are a pre-packaged, heavily-marketed series that was deliberately created to appeal to your age group...the Harry Potterites. Unlike the history of J.

One Snicket book does NOT equal one Potter book in length or quality; therefore it's perfectly suitable that they put three Snickets together for this movie. The little gimmicks that made the early books amusing (the author's asides to define words, the translations of the baby's gurgles) become tediously annoying tics in the later books.

In fact, the movie even softened the tone a bit with the touching flashbacks about the missing parents, building a "sanctuary," etc.\n\nAnd what's with the wonderful, yet thrown-away closing credits?

I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":681307,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I don't like children movies with all their stupid messages. I saw this movie rather just to pass the time than to watch it for its sake. And Whoa! I was drawn in this river in first 5 minutes. And what a experience it has been! Right from the start as the narrator describes his world, you are immediately there. You feel yourself in the characters place. The movie does that for you. This is very uncommon movie and it has set a milestone for 3D, not because of its technical aspects, but because of the Depth this movie has. This movie is as much for a 7 year old as it is for an old man who has seen a lot of life. This movie will entertain each viewer in his own way. This is a masterpiece! This movie isn't what it sounds on the surface. It has layers of meanings attached to it. Look at just the title: How to train your Dragon!. If you see it carefully you will notice that there is more to it than meets the eye. Watch the movie and you will know what i mean. This movie cleverly comments on Human Fear, War, Friendship, prejudices, courage, Love. ........................... Don't miss this movie or you will miss one of the few periods when you really LIVE. Note: Just remember to carry your heart with you when you see this movie. It will fill your heart with nothing but what should truly belong there. 10/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":681307,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This way, the film gives a strong empowering look on life and identities, a good message for girls and boys alike.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":252,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2020-10-14","keywords":"year 1863,american west,calamity jane character,teenage girl,female protagonist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3971006745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE5MjAzNTYtMTdlMy00MGYwLTk3ZjItZGQ5MzlkZWU3ZjFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzE5MjAzNTYtMTdlMy00MGYwLTk3ZjItZGQ5MzlkZWU3ZjFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10450153/","name":"Salomé Boulven","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0484005/","name":"Alexandra Lamy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866496/","name":"Alexis Tomassian"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2916570/","name":"Rémi Chayé"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0181248/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332406/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0441479/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2916570/","name":"Rémi Chayé","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0208150/","name":"Fabrice de Costil","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5364427/","name":"Sandra Tosello"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Our hero Martin Rauch starts the series in exile in Angola, teaching German to kids, many of whom are displaced by a proxy war fought by Africans representing manipulative communist and western interests, until he is cornered back into action by his deplorable Aunt Lenora.\n\nThere are three great facets to the whole package; the acting, the script and the overall design. Because of the language (it's in German), and the subtitles, I think I study the faces more and the expressions, the upper body leakage. The writing and story structure expertly manages to weave in real events from 1986; Chernobyl, AIDS, the Berlin nightclub bombing and the US retaliation in the bombing of Libya. But it also catches the style of the era very effectively with Mad Men style graphic titles, a sharp eye for punk fashions, especially in West Berlin, as well as big shoulder pads; all of which is complemented by snappy soundtrack, bookended each episode by the English version of Major Tom by Peter Schilling. Poignantly, just a few days after Mark Hollis died, up popped Talk Talk's Such a Shame for the pivotal scene of one of the early African adventures.\n\nThis tale is darker, I'd say, than three years previous, where it bordered on Carry on Communism at times. The government of the DDR is even crueller and more corrupt than before. There's certainly no playing it for laughs in how the Stasi treat the Fischer family.\n\nCynicism abounds and no-one really tells the truth about what they really want and what their purpose is. Everyone's a bit mean, and dishonest at the same time. The ending seems at once both hopeless and desperately sad, the ever presence of a wall that divides families, a people, a country.

Whilst I am not sure I'd consider "Vikings" to be amongst the very top tier of shows I've watched in my lifetime; I've certainly enjoyed my time with the Norsemen.\n\nRagnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel) is a farmer and raider who becomes a legendary figure amongst the Viking people by establishing consistent navigation techniques and leading successful raids on the various Kingdom's that would become Britain. Rising to become King, his legacy is cemented by the actions of his sons, particularly Bjorn Ironside (Alexander Ludwig) and Ivar The Boneless (Alex Hogh Andersen) who would rule countries and influence politics far from their homelands.\n\nThe first few episodes don't really convey the scale of the ones that would eventually follow. There are lots of great characters that appear across the run but at the start the show rests on Travis Fimmel's shoulders and he's really good. Ragnar is not a good man, or father and the danger of the character always is present in Fimmel's wild eyes but you still understand why his men fought for him and elevated him so highly that his sons could trade of his name.

Whilst I am not sure I'd consider "Vikings" to be amongst the very top tier of shows I've watched in my lifetime; I've certainly enjoyed my time with the Norsemen.\n\nRagnar Lothbrok (Travis Fimmel) is a farmer and raider who becomes a legendary figure amongst the Viking people by establishing consistent navigation techniques and leading successful raids on the various Kingdom's that would become Britain. Rising to become King, his legacy is cemented by the actions of his sons, particularly Bjorn Ironside (Alexander Ludwig) and Ivar The Boneless (Alex Hogh Andersen) who would rule countries and influence politics far from their homelands.\n\nThe first few episodes don't really convey the scale of the ones that would eventually follow. There are lots of great characters that appear across the run but at the start the show rests on Travis Fimmel's shoulders and he's really good. Ragnar is not a good man, or father and the danger of the character always is present in Fimmel's wild eyes but you still understand why his men fought for him and elevated him so highly that his sons could trade of his name. His sons each derive some aspect of him, Ubbe played by Jordan Patrick Smith is the explorer he wanted to be, Bjorn the noble King, Hvitserk, played by Marco Ilso, is the sufferer and addict and Ivar the vicious warlord. I don't really think any of the characters across the run were poorly performed and it's interesting to look back now and remember some of those characters and the stories that only played for a while.\n\nThe scale of the show gets bigger and bigger and the battle scenes more and more expansive. I don't feel as strongly as others that the show drops off as it refocuses on the sons of Ragnar but I would accept that some of the stories don't quite end at their natural point or have deviations that don't go anywhere.\n\nIt's not, for me, in that top tier "West Wing", "Game of Thrones", "The Wire" category, but it's not far below and I'm happy to have visited Kattegat for these last few years.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":461818,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-03-03","keywords":"sex scene,king,hero,sword and shield,viking","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935395/","name":"Katheryn Winnick","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0803890/","name":"Gustaf Skarsgård","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1573253/","name":"Alexander Ludwig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079853/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0304458/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330730/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0386694/","name":"Michael Hirst"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch the Final Season Now","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3793207577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2FkYzZhZjYtNTA3Ny00MmY4LTk5N2ItMzIwMmQ0MWY0NWU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2FkYzZhZjYtNTA3Ny00MmY4LTk5N2ItMzIwMmQ0MWY0NWU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Final Season Now"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Spoiler","reviewBody":"The movie from time to time flashes across my mind after I discovered the songs of Yves Montand. He sang well and I always want to see whether he acted well.\n\nJust my luck that DVD of this title was and is still not easily available in town. Why? It is not a movie for green whippersnappers or precocious imps but the well-aged wise. It was filmed some twenty years ago and I then exactly lacked twenty years' maturity. My big thank you to the 27th French Cinepanorama held in this month, after having gained twenty more years experience in life, now I know how to enjoy this movie. If I saw the movie right after it was freshly produced in 1983, I am very sure I would not understand the main plot or subplot, the observant director Claude Sautet, not to mention his ideas. After all, Yves Montand is now lying six feet under inside the cemetery Père-Lachaise in Paris and Jacques Villeret (Gilbert)'s head has gone half-bald in the French box-office hit "Le Dîner de cons" where he plays the tricked "François Pignon".\n\nThe restaurant setting reminds me the frantic and noisy kitchen in "Dinner Rush": shouting chef, cooking heat, fire and smell, the orderly mess, clicking sound of cutlery and crockery, conflict between waiters and chef.\n\nThere are usually many subplots in Sautet's works because he was able to capture human sentiments, especially those of ordinary people leading ordinary life, well in details and display it with an undertone of melancholy humour, even for serious subjects like human alienation, one of the ideas showcased in Garçon!.\n\nResourceful Alex was once a tap dancer, though not very accomplished, he seems to be respected in the dancing room. With limited funds and resources, this maturing restaurant waiter aspires to start an amusement park on the beach and he makes it! "Jerry Maguire" is the American version of Alex. Both men are capable of winning the heart of many. Every one around them likes them. They go around women one after one pretty successfully, it's nothing novel to see that they have two or three at one time. For instance, Alex has frequent trysts with rich poodle Gloria, from whom he tactfully draws out a free-interest loan of FFr100,000. Besides, he is concurrently after Claire, an English language instructor whom he knew seventeen years ago at her father's wedding on a boat. On top of these two relationships, he keeps a punctuated contact with the down-and-out Coline.\n\nOn the surface, both Jerry and Alex are candies to all. Cruelly and honestly, it is Gilbert, Alex's room-mate and colleague, who is sharp at pointing out their common blind spot: they are not related to anybody, both American Jerry and French Alex only think about themselves. What different is, Jerry's ending gives us hope while the final rainy scene of Alex at his well-received amusement park tells us what reality tends to be like: remaining alone.\n\nWhen Alex is successful with his career, his dream park, all his women left: both Gloria and Claire return to their husbands, Coline follows a younger waiter of the restaurant. To Alex, the lyrics of the golden oldie should be revised to be "And 'NOT' in my hour of need, I truly am, indeed, alone again, naturally."","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":728,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"genre":["Drama","Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1983-11-09","keywords":"french,france,seaside,one word title,exclamation point in title","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0598971/","name":"Yves Montand"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305368/","name":"Nicole Garcia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898317/","name":"Jacques Villeret"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767110/","name":"Claude Sautet"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067540/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046777/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767110/","name":"Claude Sautet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196362/","name":"Jean-Loup Dabadie"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After all, Yves Montand is now lying six feet under inside the cemetery Père-Lachaise in Paris and Jacques Villeret (Gilbert)'s head has gone half-bald in the French box-office hit "Le Dîner de cons" where he plays the tricked "François Pignon".\n\nThe restaurant setting reminds me the frantic and noisy kitchen in "Dinner Rush": shouting chef, cooking heat, fire and smell, the orderly mess, clicking sound of cutlery and crockery, conflict between waiters and chef.\n\nThere are usually many subplots in Sautet's works because he was able to capture human sentiments, especially those of ordinary people leading ordinary life, well in details and display it with an undertone of melancholy humour, even for serious subjects like human alienation, one of the ideas showcased in Garçon!.\n\nResourceful Alex was once a tap dancer, though not very accomplished, he seems to be respected in the dancing room. With limited funds and resources, this maturing restaurant waiter aspires to start an amusement park on the beach and he makes it! "Jerry Maguire" is the American version of Alex. Both men are capable of winning the heart of many. Every one around them likes them. They go around women one after one pretty successfully, it's nothing novel to see that they have two or three at one time. For instance, Alex has frequent trysts with rich poodle Gloria, from whom he tactfully draws out a free-interest loan of FFr100,000. Besides, he is concurrently after Claire, an English language instructor whom he knew seventeen years ago at her father's wedding on a boat. On top of these two relationships, he keeps a punctuated contact with the down-and-out Coline.\n\nOn the surface, both Jerry and Alex are candies to all. Cruelly and honestly, it is Gilbert, Alex's room-mate and colleague, who is sharp at pointing out their common blind spot: they are not related to anybody, both American Jerry and French Alex only think about themselves. What different is, Jerry's ending gives us hope while the final rainy scene of Alex at his well-received amusement park tells us what reality tends to be like: remaining alone.\n\nWhen Alex is successful with his career, his dream park, all his women left: both Gloria and Claire return to their husbands, Coline follows a younger waiter of the restaurant. To Alex, the lyrics of the golden oldie should be revised to be "And 'NOT' in my hour of need, I truly am, indeed, alone again, naturally."","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":728,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Drama","Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1983-11-09","keywords":"french,france,seaside,one word title,exclamation point in title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0598971/","name":"Yves Montand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0305368/","name":"Nicole Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898317/","name":"Jacques Villeret"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767110/","name":"Claude Sautet"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067540/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046777/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0767110/","name":"Claude Sautet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196362/","name":"Jean-Loup Dabadie"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But when he drinks it he becomes a sexy and evil femme fatale Hyde.\n\nSounds like a bad film? It is not. \n\nThis is one of few interesting horror films from Hammer at 70's. Director Roy Ward Baker(Vampyre Lowers) has made a film that really takes you at the late of 19's century. Ralph Bates(Horror of Frankenstein) is good as "the Ripper" Jekyll. In this version Jekyll has to do evil before he drinks the elixir. That make story more interesting. Jekyll first robs the graves with criminals called Burke and Hare(famous real life body snatchers from Edinburgh). Then he has to kill to do good. And when he finally takes a drink things are rally getting on. Martine Beswick(One million years B.C.) is beautiful, sexy and wicked as sister Hyde.\n\nIt is a good film. But still... I think that(as a fan of Robert Louis Stevenson's story)this could work better if writer/producer Brian Clemens would have made two films. One of Jekyll &amp; Hyde, another of Jack the Ripper. But after all this, it is worth to see.\n\nBut do not watch that comedy Dr. Jekyll and ms. Hyde.

We see first how Jack the Ripper kills one whore. Then we see that Ripper actually is Dr. Jekyll. Jekyll has killed womens to produced he's "elixir of life". But when he drinks it he becomes a sexy and evil femme fatale Hyde.\n\nSounds like a bad film? It is not. \n\nThis is one of few interesting horror films from Hammer at 70's. Director Roy Ward Baker(Vampyre Lowers) has made a film that really takes you at the late of 19's century. Ralph Bates(Horror of Frankenstein) is good as "the Ripper" Jekyll. In this version Jekyll has to do evil before he drinks the elixir. That make story more interesting. Jekyll first robs the graves with criminals called Burke and Hare(famous real life body snatchers from Edinburgh). Then he has to kill to do good. And when he finally takes a drink things are rally getting on. Martine Beswick(One million years B.C.) is beautiful, sexy and wicked as sister Hyde.\n\nIt is a good film. But still... I think that(as a fan of Robert Louis Stevenson's story)this could work better if writer/producer Brian Clemens would have made two films. One of Jekyll &amp; Hyde, another of Jack the Ripper. But after all this, it is worth to see.\n\nBut do not watch that comedy Dr. Jekyll and ms. Hyde.

It's a magnificent film, recreating the known offensive by Nazi Panzer tanks on the Belgian front during 1944-45 .What happened during those desperate days that could have changed the course of war is now history . It's well recreated by Ken Annakin for Warner Bros, in Cinerama production with Technicolor cinematography by Jack Hildyard. The producer, Milton Sperling was well-qualified for his job but he was a marine officer and he had 10 combat cameramen, covering three battles during the war and made three documentaries out of those events. Sperling tells that making this film recalled his owns experiences in the war and made it quite possible for the sound effects you heard today to be as realistic as those he heard when was listening to them whining overhead.The making was a logistical problem as almost that of setting up a campaign and putting a film together under any circumstances was very difficult because working under very bad weather conditions. So this whole film was put together, photographed and edited, scored and prepared for release in a matter of about eight months. We scoured Europe,there are places where such tanks do exist,sometimes in junkyards, sometimes in existing armies and just by chance, one finds a cache of tanks, guns,old planes and various other relics .The equipment managed to assemble these great numbers of tanks after looking about for months and months. So what we see on the screen are truly the Tiger tanks that were fought in the battle and the Western Front, no wonder the battle scenes looked so authentic .Robert Shaw ,with his blue eyes blazing, is the fanatical tank commander, he was chosen because he can play virtually anything that's given to him.It was rather an obvious choice , there are so few good actors and he's capable of doing anything. Henry Fonda is terrific, as obstinate officer who finds vital German attacking position. In the remaining supporting cast appear Telly Savallas as a roguish sergeant, James McArthur as an unexperienced young lieutenant, George Montgomery as a valiant veteran sergeant, among others.\n\nThe Battle of Bulge film is based on true events about the Ardennes offensive, the real deeds are the following : It was a Hitler's plan code-named ¨Watch on the Rhine¨for a breakthrough by Field Marshal Von Rundstedt aimed at the US line in the Ardennes 16 Dec 1944 . Hitler aimed to isolate the Allied forces north of the corridor which would be created by a drive through the Ardennes, creating a German salient or bulge. There were 77.000 Allied casualties and 130.000 German, including Hitler's last powerful reserve of elite Panzer units. Although US troops were encircled for some weeks at Bastogne, the German counteroffensive failed. Three armies were deployed in the operation- Dietrich's 6th Panzer,the 5th Panzer, and the 7th Panzer-together with a 'Trojan Horse' force of English-speaking in US uniforms under Otto Skorzeny. The offensive opened 16 Dec along 113 Km of the front , aiming at the US 1st Army and General Omar Bradley's 12th Army Group. Initial progress was good as the Allies were unprepared for action along a section of the front hitherto so quiet it had been nicknamed ¨the Ghost Front¨and bad weather grounded Allied air support. However, the Germans failed to capture vital fuel dumps and the dogged Allied defense of St Vith and Bastogne seriously set the operation back. Bastogne was an important road junction, lay in the path of the German advance and was held by the US 101 Airbone Division. It was besieged by German forces 18 Dec and strongly attacked , the defenses were breached in two places . However the attacks were repulsed and was relieved by the US 4th Armored Division, though fierce fighting continued in the area for some days. The Allies quickly recovered from the initial shock and, while north of the Bulge General Bernard Montgomery blocked the German advance at the Meuse, to the south Bradley's forces also struck back, with General Patton breaking through to relieve Bastogne 26 Dec. By the end of Dec the weather improved, allowing the Allied air forces to play a part in the battle and by 3 Jan 1945 the Allies took the offensive , by 16 Jan the Bulge has been eliminated.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15539,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I think it is one of the best movies made in Europe in the first years after the WW2. It is quiet and simple, but very powerful at the same time. Without any killing or death in it, this film shows the absurdness and tragedy of war better than any other I have seen. At the same time, for me this was a very good insight in the spirit of French resistance. But above all, it is about a collapse of dreams, a conflict between one's conscience and ideology, and a realisation of how senseless human feelings, aspirations and the whole existence is made by the war. Very deep and impressive.

At the end of what ends up being his six month stay at the house, he does end up having a profound effect on the uncle and niece, despite that effect being largely unacknowledged, as his stay in France has a profound effect on him, opening up his eyes to the reality of the war based largely on his first ever visit into Paris." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0039822/","name":"Le silence de la mer","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJjM2ZkZTEtZDM0My00YzU2LWEzNTMtMWExNDY3OWNmYjlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"1941 in a small town in Nazi occupied France.

I think it is one of the best movies made in Europe in the first years after the WW2. It is quiet and simple, but very powerful at the same time. Without any killing or death in it, this film shows the absurdness and tragedy of war better than any other I have seen. At the same time, for me this was a very good insight in the spirit of French resistance. But above all, it is about a collapse of dreams, a conflict between one's conscience and ideology, and a realisation of how senseless human feelings, aspirations and the whole existence is made by the war. Very deep and impressive.

I had heard of Yasujiro Ozu's "Tokyo Story" for several years but never had an opportunity to see it until Criterion resuscitated it as part of their DVD collection. Over fifty years old, this wondrous 1953 film resonates just as deeply today. Those outside Japan rarely get to see a Japanese film classic that doesn't involve samurai warriors in medieval battles. This one, however, is a subtly observed family drama set in post-WWII Japan, and it is the quietude and lack of pretense of Ozu's film-making style that makes this among the most moving of films.\n\nThe plot centers on Shukishi and Tomi, an elderly couple, who traverse the country from their southern fishing village of Onomichi to visit their adult children, daughter Shige and son Koichi, in Tokyo. Leading their own busy lives, the children realize their obligation to entertain them and pack them off to Atami, a nearby resort targeted to weekend revelers. Returning to Tokyo unexpectedly, Tomi visits their kindly daughter-in-law, Noriko, the widow of second son Shoji, while Shukishi gets drunk with some old companions. The old couple realizes they have become a burden to their children and decide to return to Onomichi. They also have a younger daughter Kyoko, a schoolteacher who lives with them, and younger son Keizo works for the train company in Osaka. By now the children, except for Kyoko and the dutiful Noriko, have given up on their parents, even when Tomi takes ill in Osaka on the way back home. From this seemingly convoluted, trivial-sounding storyline, fraught with soap opera possibilities, Ozu has fashioned a heartfelt and ultimately ironic film that focuses on the details in people's lives rather than a single dramatic situation.\n\nWhat fascinates me about Ozu's idiosyncratic style is how he relies on insinuation to carry his story forward. In fact, some of the more critical events happen off-camera because Ozu's simple, penetrating observations of these characters' lives remain powerfully insightful without being contrived. Ozu scholar David Desser, who provides insightful commentary on the alternate audio track, explains this concept as "narrative ellipses", Ozu's singularly effective means of providing emotional continuity to a story without providing all the predictable detail in between. Ozu also positions his camera low throughout his film to replicate the perspective of someone sitting on a tatami mat. It adds significantly to the humanity he evokes. There are no melodramatic confrontations among the characters, no masochistic showboating, and the dialogue is deceptively casual, as even the most off-hand remark bears weight into the story. The film condemns no one and its sense of inevitability carries with it only certain resigned sadness. What amazes me most is how the ending is so cathartic because the characters feel so real to me, not because there are manipulative plot developments, even death, which force me to feel for them.\n\nI just love the performances, as they have a neo-realism that makes them all the more affecting. Chishu Ryu and Chieko Higashiyama are wonderfully authentic as Shukishi and Tomi, perfectly conveying the resignation they feel about their lives and their children without slipping into cheap sentimentality. Higashiyama effortlessly displays the sunny demeanor of a grandmother, so when sadness does take over in her life, it becomes all the more haunting. In particular, she has a beautiful scene where Tomi looks forlornly at her grandchild wondering what he will be when he grows up and whether she will live to see what happens. Even more heartbreaking is the scene where Shukishi and Tomi sit in Ueno Park realizing their children have no time for them and are resigned to the fact that they need to find a place to sleep for the night. The closest the film has to a villain is Shige, portrayed fearlessly by Haruko Sugimura, who is able to show respect, pettiness and conniving in a realistically mercurial fashion. Watch her as she complains about the expensive cakes her husband bought for her parents (as she selfishly eats them herself) or how she finagles Koichi to co-finance the trip to Atami or how she shows her frustration when her parents come home early from the spa. So Yamamura (familiar to later Western audiences as Admiral Yamamoto in "Tora! Tora! Tora!") displays the right amount of indifference as Koichi, and Kyoko Kagawa has a few sharp lines toward the end of the film as the disappointed Kyoko.\n\nBut the best performance comes from the legendary Setsuko Hara, a luminous actress whose beauty and sensitivity remind me of Olivia de Havilland during the same era. As Noriko, she is breathtaking in showing her character's modesty, her unforced generosity in spite of her downscale status and her constant smile as a mask for her pain. She has a number of deeply affecting moments, for instance, when Noriko explains to Shukishi and Tomi how she misses her husband, even though it is implied he was a brutalizing alcoholic; or the touching goodbye to Kyoko; or her pained embarrassment over the high esteem that Shukishi holds for her kindness. Don't expect fireworks or any shocking moments, just a powerfully emotional film in spite of its seemingly modest approach. The two-disc DVD set has the commentary from Desser on the first disc, as well as the trailer. On the second disc, there are two excellent documentaries. One is a comprehensive 1983, two-hour feature focused on Ozu's life and career, and the second is a 40-minute tribute from several international movie directors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57009,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1953-11-03","keywords":"estrangement,family reunion,post world war two,japanese,generation gap","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2320022553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNGEwMTctYjgwZC00ZTMyLTk4MTMtNjA5MjQwNWMxMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNGEwMTctYjgwZC00ZTMyLTk4MTMtNjA5MjQwNWMxMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753479/","name":"Chishû Ryû"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383261/","name":"Chieko Higashiyama"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0945522/","name":"Sô Yamamura"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654868/","name":"Yasujirô Ozu"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007001/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0633792/","name":"Kôgo Noda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654868/","name":"Yasujirô Ozu"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One is a comprehensive 1983, two-hour feature focused on Ozu's life and career, and the second is a 40-minute tribute from several international movie directors.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57009,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1953-11-03","keywords":"estrangement,family reunion,post world war two,japanese,generation gap","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2320022553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNGEwMTctYjgwZC00ZTMyLTk4MTMtNjA5MjQwNWMxMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIxNGEwMTctYjgwZC00ZTMyLTk4MTMtNjA5MjQwNWMxMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753479/","name":"Chishû Ryû","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383261/","name":"Chieko Higashiyama","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0945522/","name":"Sô Yamamura"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654868/","name":"Yasujirô Ozu"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007001/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0633792/","name":"Kôgo Noda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654868/","name":"Yasujirô Ozu"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Although the bandit leader has the men and the weapons, they lack a person with the leadership abilities to complete the mission. Likewise, nobody trusts Lobero to keep his end of the bargain. For that reason, the decision is made to have Max try to persuade "Chris" (George Kennedy) to lead the mission for $600 in gold. Naturally, he also needs some good men he can trust so he recruits a few of them on the way to Mexico.

Although the bandit leader has the men and the weapons, they lack a person with the leadership abilities to complete the mission. Likewise, nobody trusts Lobero to keep his end of the bargain. For that reason, the decision is made to have Max try to persuade "Chris" (George Kennedy) to lead the mission for $600 in gold. Naturally, he also needs some good men he can trust so he recruits a few of them on the way to Mexico.

A forgotten classic that on second viewing still has the same impact when we saw it at a retrospective of the master's work some time back. Fellini was instrumental in creating this magnificent movie about con men that operated in Italy in the years that followed the end of WWII. Fellini worked on the screen play with his collaborators, Tullio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano; they gave life to all these swindlers and made them human. Nino Rota's music and Otello Martinelli's cinematography compliment the film and make it even better.\n\nFellini was a director that got a lot from his actors, as he shows in "Il Bidone". Working with Broderick Crawford, and again with Richard Basehart, he was able to have both men give excellent performances, especially Mr. Crawford, who looks as though he is nothing but Italian because he convinces us he is the hard man he is portraying.\n\nThe three friends, Augusto, Picasso, and Roberto, go from one scheme to the next, never thinking about who are they stealing from. The best caper occurs at the beginning of the film as the trio arrives at the farm of the two older women with the promise of riches hidden in their land. Mr. Crawford's bishop is perfect. So is the assistant priest of Richard Basehart. Franco Fabrizi is the driver. The solution for getting the money away from the poor women is something not to be believed.\n\nAugusto's life is an empty one. He goes from one job to another trying to outsmart his victims. It's not until Augusto meets his daughter Patrizia by chance, that he begins to feel what might be some remorse for his actions as he notices his beautiful daughter now grown and on her way to making something out of her life. His conscience begins to bother him because he realizes the evil of his ways.\n\nThe other best sequence in the film involves the party at Vargas' house where the swindlers have been invited to celebrate the arrival of the new year. We watch as Iris, Picasso's wife, realizes what her husband and the others are really up to. Roberto, the ladies' man, steals the gold cigarette case, not realizing that he is at the home of another con man and his actions will not go unnoticed, but even the embarrassment he goes through in front of the guests will make him give up his life.\n\n"Il Bidone" is a fine example of the Italian cinema of those years as it shows an artist of the caliber of Federico Fellini in top form. The film will delight people that haven't been exposed to that part of Mr. Fellini's career seldom seen these days.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1955-10-07","keywords":"italy,con man,peasant,new year's eve,nightclub","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002024/","name":"Broderick Crawford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000865/","name":"Richard Basehart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0556399/","name":"Giulietta Masina"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000019/","name":"Federico Fellini"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032224/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005342/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000019/","name":"Federico Fellini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0280919/","name":"Ennio Flaiano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684083/","name":"Tullio Pinelli"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The supporting cast is also quite good if more generalized in their characterizations, more a fault of the screenplay than the performers. There is one especially fine supporting performance from Lionel Jeffries as the maniacal Lord Queensbury. Jeffries plays Queensbury as a crazed brute, a type of man we can no longer countenance in these days, though I suspect they are still out there waiting for their chance to pounce on those who they fear and do not understand.\n\nSonia Dresdel is Lady Wilde, Oscar's dotty mother at the end of her life.

Other people in Wilde's life, Constance, his wife, and Ada Leverson, his stalwart friend and life-long supporter, are tantalizingly glimpsed but little is revealed of their inner workings.

This might sound boring but it isn't.\n\nJames Mason appears in the first trial as the defending witness, for Lord Queensbury, and a more vicious, narrow-minded lawyer could hardly be found, even these days.\n\nThe technical credits are competent if nothing special; the music, melodramatic in a soap-opera-ish way, the sets plush and too clean. But somehow the power and tragedy of Wilde's story comes through all the gilding of the script, peppered with some of Wilde's wiser quotes, well-placed, naturally, in the text. There is nothing preachy or moralistic which is a relief, compared to the highly politicized scripts being written since this film was made.\n\nIt is interesting to note Nicholas Roeg as the camera operator.

Although the bandit leader has the men and the weapons, they lack a person with the leadership abilities to complete the mission. Likewise, nobody trusts Lobero to keep his end of the bargain. For that reason, the decision is made to have Max try to persuade "Chris" (George Kennedy) to lead the mission for $600 in gold. Naturally, he also needs some good men he can trust so he recruits a few of them on the way to Mexico. But even then the odds are not in his favor and when Lobero pulls out at the last minute the chances of success decrease even more. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay western which managed to keep my interest for the most part.

Although the bandit leader has the men and the weapons, they lack a person with the leadership abilities to complete the mission. Likewise, nobody trusts Lobero to keep his end of the bargain. For that reason, the decision is made to have Max try to persuade "Chris" (George Kennedy) to lead the mission for $600 in gold. Naturally, he also needs some good men he can trust so he recruits a few of them on the way to Mexico. But even then the odds are not in his favor and when Lobero pulls out at the last minute the chances of success decrease even more. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was an okay western which managed to keep my interest for the most part. Of course, it suffers in comparison to the original film, "The Magnificent Seven" but that probably goes without saying . Be that as it may, I have rated it accordingly.

Few of the scenes are allowed to resolve themselves,while a few shots needed to be cut much shorter (the Ancestral Ghosts and their overlong, unfunny dance, for instance - 20 seconds would've been enough) leaving one to assume that many minutes of the story were trashed by Ealing's "mortician".\n\nThe story would have been well served if we could have seen a few positive effects upon the Town, when the Pier became a Ship. Just a few shots of people crowding into sad restaurants and seaside rooming houses, while they awaited a 'berth' on the Arabella, would have built much expectation and suspense. I bet that such scenes WERE filmed but later chopped, as there are several references to the Arabella bringing much business to the Town, but we never see that. \n\nI cannot recall another movie like this, where drama, dialogue, and music cues are cut-off by disturbing "fades-outs" of sound and picture. But if the MGM idiots (who also dumped its entire warehouse/library into pits along a highway) had anything to do with this, one should not be surprised.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1013,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1957-12-21","keywords":"pier,seasickness,arcade,cruise ship,english channel","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000027/","name":"Alec Guinness"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0516742/","name":"Harry Locke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684891/","name":"Frederick Piper"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0294243/","name":"Charles Frend"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040024/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165021/","name":"T.E.B.

Few of the scenes are allowed to resolve themselves,while a few shots needed to be cut much shorter (the Ancestral Ghosts and their overlong, unfunny dance, for instance - 20 seconds would've been enough) leaving one to assume that many minutes of the story were trashed by Ealing's "mortician".\n\nThe story would have been well served if we could have seen a few positive effects upon the Town, when the Pier became a Ship. Just a few shots of people crowding into sad restaurants and seaside rooming houses, while they awaited a 'berth' on the Arabella, would have built much expectation and suspense. I bet that such scenes WERE filmed but later chopped, as there are several references to the Arabella bringing much business to the Town, but we never see that. \n\nI cannot recall another movie like this, where drama, dialogue, and music cues are cut-off by disturbing "fades-outs" of sound and picture. But if the MGM idiots (who also dumped its entire warehouse/library into pits along a highway) had anything to do with this, one should not be surprised.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1013,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1957-12-21","keywords":"pier,seasickness,arcade,cruise ship,english channel","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000027/","name":"Alec Guinness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0516742/","name":"Harry Locke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684891/","name":"Frederick Piper"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0294243/","name":"Charles Frend"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040024/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0165021/","name":"T.E.B.

Robert works in the countryside in a private school owned by the headmaster Michael Carmichael (Peter Cushing), who is married with Molly Carmichael (Joan Collins). On the eve of moving to the country with her husband, Peggy spends the night at the board house of Mrs. Beamish (Gillian Lind) and is attacked by a man with mechanical arm in her room. Mrs. Beamish calls the doctor but they do not believe in Peggy. On the next morning, she heads with Robert to the country and moves to the cottage in the school. But soon Peggy is attacked by the same man but Robert does not believe in her. Then she meets The Headmaster and realizes that he has a mechanical arm.

No character is oversimplified; even the appalling jihadists are granted their humanity. I've seen "Boyhood" and "Birdman", the apparent favorites for the Oscar. "Timbuktu" utterly blows both those fine movies out of the water.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16885,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2014-12-10","keywords":"desert,islamic fundamentalism,tuareg,mali,timbuktu","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Timbuktu","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3522738713","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjE3MTAxZTEtZGE5My00YzllLTk3YjgtNGQ1OTY3NzlkZmNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjE3MTAxZTEtZGE5My00YzllLTk3YjgtNGQ1OTY3NzlkZmNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Timbuktu","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6784754/","name":"Ibrahim Ahmed","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0229139/","name":"Abel Jafri","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6158234/","name":"Toulou Kiki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0803066/","name":"Abderrahmane Sissako"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167020/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0500028/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0484354/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0803066/","name":"Abderrahmane Sissako","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6158235/","name":"Kessen Tall"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Victorian part of the film emerges from the dawning of the concept of abnormal psychology (just before Freud) and is really convincing. Streep shows us that her character cannot move on emotionally until she has worked out her own madness. That constitutes a remarkable and complex performance of insanity and self-awareness inhabiting a single psyche. She earns the gentle movement out of the tunnel and onto the calm lake. The turbulence of the unconscious -- that threatening sea of which Irons has warned her -- has been subdued. Seems to me the flaw lies in the 'modern story' (as some here have pointed out). It may be that the Streep character is trying to find a subtext for her fictional heroine, but it looks like the old ennui, so that, while her lack of concern for the relationship is understandable, his obsession with it is not. Though the garden party at the end almost gets it there. Were we shown her decision there? If so, I missed it. I like the concept of the 'two endings' and their contrast, but the ending in the 20th century was a so what? The one in the 19th century was complex and included much of the pain that the relationship had caused both characters. A little more attention to the contemporary love affair -- to suggest that it was more than just a romp on location -- would have helped that dimension of the film per se and also suggested what the Victorian lovers had earned within their Hardyesque world.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12969,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1981-10-16","keywords":"love,actress,tragedy,victorian era,filmmaking","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The French Lieutenant's Woman","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1067779353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjhlNDJiMTgtNDhiOS00YWU1LTk0MzgtZWI0MjQ1NDY0ZDRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjhlNDJiMTgtNDhiOS00YWU1LTk0MzgtZWI0MjQ1NDY0ZDRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000658/","name":"Meryl Streep"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000460/","name":"Jeremy Irons"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0574436/","name":"Hilton McRae"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718554/","name":"Karel Reisz"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103522/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0288826/","name":"John Fowles"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0056217/","name":"Harold Pinter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718554/","name":"Karel Reisz"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Or any of the characters? Maybe, but it certainly didn't come across in the film. The apathy of the characters was matched by my apathy for this film.\n\nAny attempts at building suspense or atmosphere fail with long lingering shots making up the bulk of this film. This would have made a much better short without the many many 10 second long lingering shots of expressionless faces or landscapes with, at best, mediocre framing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":279,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-06-05","keywords":"bus,classroom,mathematics class,taking a photograph,youth","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi233290777","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWRhNWU4NTEtZjcyYi00YWZjLWFmZjMtZDBhMGJjNjhiNDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWRhNWU4NTEtZjcyYi00YWZjLWFmZjMtZDBhMGJjNjhiNDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9783900/","name":"Thomas Daloz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10662362/","name":"Néa Lüders","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9783901/","name":"Salvatore Ferro"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2126391/","name":"Blaise Harrison"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076118/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0321775/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625796/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2126391/","name":"Blaise Harrison","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1768265/","name":"Mariette Désert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4025265/","name":"Dimitri Kourtchine"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Like the bridge, which serves as allegory, the two "lovers?" ( probably better termed co-dependents in an abusive relationship) have to be nearly destroyed before they can be rebuilt. Possessive, selfish, self-destructive, they lead each other into the abyss until the woman finds redemption through traditional values and the man finds redemption through prison.

I related to this so much; it had so much depth and realism that it was pure, unadulterated joy to watch.\n\nMaybe it was that I wasn't expecting much or that I had something incredibly different pictured in my head but, whatever it was, it floored me completely.\n\nFor me, this film was a perfect blend of action, adventure, comedy, and romance, with a dash of slice-of-life to boot and make the concoction its own thing. I would gladly have it over and over again.\n\nAnd do not get me started on the music and the visuals; absolutely sublime. What gorgeous cinematography, add to it beautiful vocals and decadent tunes, it becomes magic.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":299380,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There isn't a great deal that's new about Yi'nan Diao's "The Wild Goose Lake". Walter Hill, Jean-Pierre Melville or more recently Michael Mann could have made this but Diao's use of flashbacks to propel the story and his superb use of locations certainly give this an edge. Despite the fatalistic tone it's hardly what you would call existential despite moving at a fairly leisurely pace. The plot isn't always easy to follow and sometimes it's hard to know who belongs to whose gang or who's a cop and who isn't.\n\nAs a cop killer on the run, Ge Hu is as cool as they come; in another lifetime Delon or Belmondo might have played this part and Lun-Mei Kwei is excellent as the film's femme fatale. In the end there is more atmosphere than action and the film's look finally overwhelms its content but it's great that in this day and age this kind of gangster film is being made and that China has taken such a fundamentally American genre and twisted it to its own ends.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There isn't a great deal that's new about Yi'nan Diao's "The Wild Goose Lake". Walter Hill, Jean-Pierre Melville or more recently Michael Mann could have made this but Diao's use of flashbacks to propel the story and his superb use of locations certainly give this an edge. Despite the fatalistic tone it's hardly what you would call existential despite moving at a fairly leisurely pace. The plot isn't always easy to follow and sometimes it's hard to know who belongs to whose gang or who's a cop and who isn't.\n\nAs a cop killer on the run, Ge Hu is as cool as they come; in another lifetime Delon or Belmondo might have played this part and Lun-Mei Kwei is excellent as the film's femme fatale. In the end there is more atmosphere than action and the film's look finally overwhelms its content but it's great that in this day and age this kind of gangster film is being made and that China has taken such a fundamentally American genre and twisted it to its own ends.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5788,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

All of these films share the same basic formula of 4 or 5 seemingly unrelated stories that ultimately converge on a particular holiday in a big city. If you're familiar with Gary Marshall's illustrious career including iconic films like "Pretty Woman" (1990) and going all the way back to 70s TV with "Happy Days" and "Laverne &amp; Shirley" (and yes! He is married to Penny "Laverne" Marshall who makes a brief but funny cameo in this movie), then you know basically what to expect: good clean fun that won't necessarily change your life or fix the ozone layer, but it's great entertainment for a night. Eeeh slightly on the sappy/predictable side, but heck, what do you expect from a PG-13 movie?\n\nAs with Marshall's other films, the appeal lies largely in a superstar studded cast. Robert De Niro, Halle Berry, Ashton Kutcher, Hilary Swank, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jon Bon Jovi (wait... Who?), and buckets of cameos like James Belushi, Ludicrous (argh, IMDb's auto spell checker keeps messing up the spelling), Cary Elwes and Alyssa Milano whose scene actually got cut. However my biggest criticism is that, by splitting the screen time between so many show-stealers in so many little segments, nobody really gets a chance to shine. And for example you may be a little annoyed that a master thespian like Robert De Niro is on screen for only a combined 10 minutes, if even that. Thus, the big names come across as somewhat gimmicky.\n\nMy next biggest criticism is that the jokes and gags weren't that great. At times it felt like the movie was trying too hard to make a lukewarm joke work. You know, like when you start to tell a lame joke at the office water cooler, then in your mind you realize how lame it is, so you try to dramatize it with flourishes and big arm gestures. Yeah because that always works. Not that I do that. Much.\n\nBut then you realize that this really is a tale in the tradition of 70s sitcom, predictable, slightly flat, but with its own distinct style that might make you catch yourself grinning.\n\nGary, if you're out there reading this (yeah because award winning Hollywood directors like to waste their time trolling internet movie sites), I'd like to suggest that the darker, edgier segments work best. For example Ashton Kutcher (whom I normally don't care for) played an excellent role as a misanthropic hipster poseur, sort of a modern day scrooge, who spends his time tearing down party decorations in his apartment building. Most of the other segments were a bit too chipper, and thus they suffered from lack of humorous irony, which, ask Mel Brooks, is important in comedy. Of course, the most important thing in comedy is... well... (insert big arm gesture) ...you know... like... timing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I read many reviews going either way, but I must say I enjoyed the film very much. Many are quick to criticize Mac's performance saying he didn't do a good job. I thought he was fine, but believe me he is no Colin. Keira Knightley was absolutely incredible in the film, I would go as far to say it is her breakout performance. Donald Sutherland was amazing, but as can be expected from him. Judi, like always is incredible at her role as Lady Catherine.\n\nIf you are a complete avid fan of the book as I am, you may or may not like it. My only complaint was that it was in fact short, but then again it is quite hard to make a 370+ page novel into a two hour movie easily. There is a phenomenal display of acting by the entire cast, and the score is perfect.\n\nOne warning though, the movie concentrates on the love story more than Austen's satire of society, so many Austen fans may be angry with that. But overall I thought it was a great film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":267701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I read many reviews going either way, but I must say I enjoyed the film very much. Many are quick to criticize Mac's performance saying he didn't do a good job. I thought he was fine, but believe me he is no Colin. Keira Knightley was absolutely incredible in the film, I would go as far to say it is her breakout performance. Donald Sutherland was amazing, but as can be expected from him. Judi, like always is incredible at her role as Lady Catherine.\n\nIf you are a complete avid fan of the book as I am, you may or may not like it. My only complaint was that it was in fact short, but then again it is quite hard to make a 370+ page novel into a two hour movie easily. There is a phenomenal display of acting by the entire cast, and the score is perfect.\n\nOne warning though, the movie concentrates on the love story more than Austen's satire of society, so many Austen fans may be angry with that. But overall I thought it was a great film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":267701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You literally feel their emotions.\n\nI have read so many wonderful reviews I just wanted to add that we look at Jo and Alex and we feel love and we think that it would have been wonderful if they end up together. But that's not the reality. It is beautiful and it is so desirable because it is not possible. Once it becomes the reality it will be all ruined.\n\nOne question that this movie brings up is about cheating and betrayal. For me Joanna has cheated "more" than Michael. You see Michael realizing straight away that he made a mistake and jumps on the way back but on the other hand you see Joanna fulfilled with emotions and desires but not for Michael but Alex.\n\nAlex is a romantic movie for Joanna, she wants to have it as a perfect dream and every time she has this moment of unhappiness she could think of "what if"\n\nThe movie is amazing. My favorite and I definitely recommend to watch it. I believe anyone can relate themselves to at least one of the characters.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":47443,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was co-written and directed by Stéphane Brizé. \n\nIn a short introduction before the film began, the presenter pointed out the the actual translation of the French title would be "The Law of the Market." Both titles tell us something about the plot of the movie. "The Measure of a Man" emphasizes the basic humanity of the protagonist. "The Law of the Market" emphasizes the basic inhumanity of the marketplace-driven society in which he lives.\n\nVincent Lindon plays Thierry Taugourdeau, who has lost his skilled labor job because of a factory closure. (Other displaced workers want to sue the company for pulling out of France to go elsewhere. Apparently, this isn't legal if the company is making a profit in France. However, Thierry isn't interested.)\n\nThierry is accustomed to getting a good salary in a respected job. As the film opens, we learn that he has taken a three-month course in order to learn how to be a crane operator. He informs the government employment counselor that the course was worthless. Companies will only employ crane operators that are already experienced construction workers. Why did they advise him to take a course that couldn't lead to employment?\n\nThe film continues in the same vein. Thierry truly wants to work to support himself, his wife, and his son with cerebral palsy. (The son is portrayed by Matthieu Schaller, who does indeed have cerebral palsy.)\n\nWe follow Thierry from frustration to frustration as nothing he does brings him employment. Finally, he obtains employment, and that is where the measure of a man begins.\n\nThis is a fascinating--but painful--movie to watch. We're accustomed to unhappy stories in which the protagonists are down-and-out, and the situation is hopeless. This plot doesn't fit into that mold. Thierry has had a comfortable, middle-class life. He's intelligent and resourceful. Even so, he can't counter the forces of society that tell him that he and his family have to move down a notch--or more--in order to survive.\n\nVincent Lindon is brilliant in this role. We can identify with him and it is not a comfortable feeling. Lindon won the Best Actor award at Cannes for this portrayal, and I'm not surprised. It's worth seeing this film just for an opportunity to watch a superb actor succeeding in a difficult role.\n\nWe saw this film in the excellent Dryden Theatre in Rochester's George Eastman Museum. It was shown a part of the outstanding Rochester Labor Film Series. \n\nFor reasons I don't understand, this movie has a dismal IMDb rating of 6.8. Possibly, reviewers found it simply too depressing. Yes, it's depressing, but it reflects reality, and I think it's definitely worth seeking out. It's available on DVD and Blu-Ray. It's too important a film to miss.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5928,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-05-19","keywords":"supermarket,working class,france,trailer camp,campground","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"La loi du marché (The Measure of a Man)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2223026201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MDMzMTc2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA3MTQ2NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MDMzMTc2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA3MTQ2NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Full trailer for La loi du marché (The Measure of a Man) in French."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0512071/","name":"Vincent Lindon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7379140/","name":"Karine de Mirbeck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7379141/","name":"Matthieu Schaller"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0110300/","name":"Stéphane Brizé"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085679/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0110300/","name":"Stéphane Brizé"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0329825/","name":"Olivier Gorce"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

All of these films share the same basic formula of 4 or 5 seemingly unrelated stories that ultimately converge on a particular holiday in a big city. If you're familiar with Gary Marshall's illustrious career including iconic films like "Pretty Woman" (1990) and going all the way back to 70s TV with "Happy Days" and "Laverne &amp; Shirley" (and yes! He is married to Penny "Laverne" Marshall who makes a brief but funny cameo in this movie), then you know basically what to expect: good clean fun that won't necessarily change your life or fix the ozone layer, but it's great entertainment for a night. Eeeh slightly on the sappy/predictable side, but heck, what do you expect from a PG-13 movie?\n\nAs with Marshall's other films, the appeal lies largely in a superstar studded cast. Robert De Niro, Halle Berry, Ashton Kutcher, Hilary Swank, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jon Bon Jovi (wait... Who?), and buckets of cameos like James Belushi, Ludicrous (argh, IMDb's auto spell checker keeps messing up the spelling), Cary Elwes and Alyssa Milano whose scene actually got cut. However my biggest criticism is that, by splitting the screen time between so many show-stealers in so many little segments, nobody really gets a chance to shine. And for example you may be a little annoyed that a master thespian like Robert De Niro is on screen for only a combined 10 minutes, if even that. Thus, the big names come across as somewhat gimmicky.\n\nMy next biggest criticism is that the jokes and gags weren't that great. At times it felt like the movie was trying too hard to make a lukewarm joke work. You know, like when you start to tell a lame joke at the office water cooler, then in your mind you realize how lame it is, so you try to dramatize it with flourishes and big arm gestures. Yeah because that always works. Not that I do that. Much.\n\nBut then you realize that this really is a tale in the tradition of 70s sitcom, predictable, slightly flat, but with its own distinct style that might make you catch yourself grinning.\n\nGary, if you're out there reading this (yeah because award winning Hollywood directors like to waste their time trolling internet movie sites), I'd like to suggest that the darker, edgier segments work best. For example Ashton Kutcher (whom I normally don't care for) played an excellent role as a misanthropic hipster poseur, sort of a modern day scrooge, who spends his time tearing down party decorations in his apartment building. Most of the other segments were a bit too chipper, and thus they suffered from lack of humorous irony, which, ask Mel Brooks, is important in comedy. Of course, the most important thing in comedy is... well...

I do have to admit that I am an Adam Sandler fan. Being 21, I grew up seeing his films in theaters and for the most part liked them all. I think with Big Daddy, Dennis Dugan and Adam Sandler's Happy Madison crew really started a formula of movie. Central conflicted and imperfect character Adam (who has a good heart of course), falls in love with the girl of his dreams, who is younger and way better looking than him, all formulated around a specific central premise (i.e. with this film it's Adam's lies piling on top of lies) supported by extremely strong, quirky side character performances. This might be the epitome of this established formula, really passing 50 First Dates in my opinion.

Nicole was a bit over the top as she has been of late (like since Moulin Rouge), but thats what her character called for so I understand. Dave was surprisingly good as an almost drugged up yuppie, cool boyfriend of Nicole's. Nick Swardson was absolutely hilarious and by far steals every scene he is in. He really comes into the movie about 1/3 of the way in and from there on out its his movie. Nick Swardson deserves fame for this.\n\nI can't say for sure how the critics will receive it. I can handle suspension of disbelief as long as it leads to a funny payoff. For the most part these moments are delivered. It's a great date movie and a great movie for Sandler fans. He has an unbelievable recent track record for success, but this will top all of them at the box office."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":226814,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I do have to admit that I am an Adam Sandler fan. Being 21, I grew up seeing his films in theaters and for the most part liked them all. I think with Big Daddy, Dennis Dugan and Adam Sandler's Happy Madison crew really started a formula of movie. Central conflicted and imperfect character Adam (who has a good heart of course), falls in love with the girl of his dreams, who is younger and way better looking than him, all formulated around a specific central premise (i.e. with this film it's Adam's lies piling on top of lies) supported by extremely strong, quirky side character performances. This might be the epitome of this established formula, really passing 50 First Dates in my opinion. The typical Sandler ridiculous humor and smart-ass remarks are extremely well balanced with perfectly timed and executed emotional moments. The set-up for the story is pretty basic and at first almost appears predictable. It is to some extent, but the crazy directions the movie takes based on Sandler's lies is well done and only stretches a few times.

A great start for Sony Pictures Animation!","reviewBody":"What's a 'unihorn' you may ask? Well, it's a deer that only has one antler, of course. And you'll only see one in the new Sony Pictures Animation film, Open Season, starring Martin Lawrence, Debra Messing, Ashton Kutcher, Gary Sinise, Jon Favreau, and many more.\n\nMartin voices the lovable Boog in the film; he's the main attraction of a show at the zoo with his best friend, Beth (Debra Messing). Boog also lives with Beth, equipped with his stuffed animal, Dunkleman. On a completely side note, what would a Sony film be without a reference to one of their own. Before Boog settles in for his comfy night sleep, he checks out Pat Sajak on Wheel of Fortune.\n\nThey have a great life together doing shows for the fans, even exchanging powerful roars. But that's before Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) shows up, the hapless one-antlered deer who's been captured by the evil Shaw (Gary Sinise). Boog helps Elliot escape and makes Boog's and Beth's life miserable, forcing Beth to send the two animals away into the forest.\n\nOn his own for the first time, Boog now has to rely on himself, or be stuck with Elliot. And that means figuring out how to go to the bathroom in the wild. That's when he first runs into McSquizzy, the squirrel (voiced by Billy Connolly)  McSquizzy is the ruler of the forest trees, and has a great and powerful squirrel Army to back him up, equipped with thousand of acorns. Without a doubt, McSquizzy is one of the highlights of Open Season! He's got wit, humor, and a ton of Scottish charm.\n\nBoog realizes having Elliot around is the only way he'll get back to Beth. So they become 'partners,' much to the dismay of Boog  but the delight of Elliot, who just needs a friend. With hunting season right around the corner, the two must work together to sneak around the hunters.\n\nBut when Shaw breaks the hunting season date, the animals switch their thinking  instead of running away, they're going to fight back! And fight back they do! Trying to run away, Boog crosses a dam; unfortunately, his 900 pound body crumbles the wood.\n\nThat's when Open Season turns into Hill Street Blues! There is one of the most amazing chase scenes I've ever seen in the movies. Boog, Elliot, and their porcupine friend try and escape the gun shots of Shaw  but on water. Bobbing and weaving through the water, under water, above water, around rocks  great scene! There's even a waterfall at the end to top it off! I have somewhat of a test for animated movies I've been giving myself over the past few years  ever since seeing the water scenes in The Incredibles, and noticing how real it looked, I've started to take an eye to the screen. If water doesn't look real, than it doesn't pass the test. Let's just say, Open Season aced my test. This water chase scene goes on for about 5 minutes, maybe a little more; but it's so exciting and amazing to watch! It's not just the water of Open Season, it's the entire field of animation; the animals really come alive on the screen. I'm a huge fan of animation; I think it has to do with the fact that anything done with computer fascinates me. The detailed description of each character, from their eyes, nose, mouth, walk, and hair  and in this movie, fur; it's just so amazing! But back to the story - after meeting back up with the group of beavers, led by Reilly (voiced by Jon Favreau), some of Elliot's former deer mates (Patrick Warburton and Jane Krakowski), and a few other animals, Boog and Elliot team up and go on the attack against the hunters. Bras, plungers, grills, forks, knives, spoons, and basically, anything they can get their hands on  sorry, whatever they can get their paws on  they use to charge the hunters with.\n\nOpen Season is directed by Jill Culton, Roger Allers, and Tony Stacchi; each has a number of major credits to their name. Both Tony and Jill make their feature directorial debut on this film; however, Jill has worked at Pixar on the character development for Monsters Inc. and Toy Story. Tony worked on a number of films for ILM including Hook and Ghost. Roger Allers co-directed The Lion King, and has just recently completed The Little Match Girl  a short attached to The Little Mermaid.\n\nOpen Season is a fun and very enjoyable film for kids and families. It's definitely a film you'll be talking about for a long time. And don't forget, you can also check out the film in IMAX 3D, opening at major theaters across the country.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89010,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A great start for Sony Pictures Animation!","reviewBody":"What's a 'unihorn' you may ask? Well, it's a deer that only has one antler, of course. And you'll only see one in the new Sony Pictures Animation film, Open Season, starring Martin Lawrence, Debra Messing, Ashton Kutcher, Gary Sinise, Jon Favreau, and many more.\n\nMartin voices the lovable Boog in the film; he's the main attraction of a show at the zoo with his best friend, Beth (Debra Messing). Boog also lives with Beth, equipped with his stuffed animal, Dunkleman. On a completely side note, what would a Sony film be without a reference to one of their own. Before Boog settles in for his comfy night sleep, he checks out Pat Sajak on Wheel of Fortune.\n\nThey have a great life together doing shows for the fans, even exchanging powerful roars. But that's before Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) shows up, the hapless one-antlered deer who's been captured by the evil Shaw (Gary Sinise). Boog helps Elliot escape and makes Boog's and Beth's life miserable, forcing Beth to send the two animals away into the forest.\n\nOn his own for the first time, Boog now has to rely on himself, or be stuck with Elliot. And that means figuring out how to go to the bathroom in the wild. That's when he first runs into McSquizzy, the squirrel (voiced by Billy Connolly)  McSquizzy is the ruler of the forest trees, and has a great and powerful squirrel Army to back him up, equipped with thousand of acorns. Without a doubt, McSquizzy is one of the highlights of Open Season! He's got wit, humor, and a ton of Scottish charm.\n\nBoog realizes having Elliot around is the only way he'll get back to Beth. So they become 'partners,' much to the dismay of Boog  but the delight of Elliot, who just needs a friend. With hunting season right around the corner, the two must work together to sneak around the hunters.\n\nBut when Shaw breaks the hunting season date, the animals switch their thinking  instead of running away, they're going to fight back! And fight back they do! Trying to run away, Boog crosses a dam; unfortunately, his 900 pound body crumbles the wood.\n\nThat's when Open Season turns into Hill Street Blues! There is one of the most amazing chase scenes I've ever seen in the movies. Boog, Elliot, and their porcupine friend try and escape the gun shots of Shaw  but on water. Bobbing and weaving through the water, under water, above water, around rocks  great scene! There's even a waterfall at the end to top it off! I have somewhat of a test for animated movies I've been giving myself over the past few years  ever since seeing the water scenes in The Incredibles, and noticing how real it looked, I've started to take an eye to the screen.

Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.\n\nI have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it "reality" but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie &amp; The Chocolate Factory is all about  It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with "real" sets, "real" Oompas Loompas, "real" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film. \n\nAfter that, it's just emotions. All kinds of them: laughs (many  the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds), tears of joy (we all know Charlie's gonna find that ticket but when he does, you just can't refrain your heart to beat faster), mercy (the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket's family is really touching), amazement (the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder, one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us) and many mores. Very much like the book, even though it seems simple and childish, you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don't have the time. It just never stops (I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact). Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.\n\nJohnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won't compare with Gene Wilder since I don't know the first film very well (pretty unknown flick here in Europe) and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn't know much about common courtesy and doesn't really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he's pretty proud of it. He just doesn't want those "weird" (a word he likes  you've all seen the TV spots) and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet  So Depp's Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus, Vercua, Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them, you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that, John August's vision of Wonka's past (including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee) offers the character a real depth you didn't expect.\n\nDanny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic Burton/Elfman work with some interesting experiments (the main themes are splendid), the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don't intend to stay with you for months (it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses), they're just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it'll come out, it'll bring them back 15 years ago.\n\nWhat can I tell you more ? McDowell's sets are amazing, Pescucci's work is impressive as well as Rousselot's beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.\n\nAs for the ending, without revealing it, August's additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton's new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the "family" theme that he developed through the film (it's still Burton, not Disney), Burton makes you feel good because he feels good (and what I'm writing here will ring a bell when you'll see the movie). I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films, it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father, he became one, he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the "Edward Scissorhands" of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions.\n\nThank you, M.Burton.

Burton and his team made me cross deserves an homage. Especially with all that criticism rising around the film before it has been released.\n\nI have been a Tim Burton fan for more than a decade now; I grew up with his films. But what I have been through yesterday his really unique. I actually never thought he would offer us such a film one day. Fans of his first period, with all the lonely and desperate characters won't like it for sure. Since Mars Attacks !, and more specifically since Big Fish, Burton decided to tell things differently. His vision of the world slightly changed in every of his films : now, the rejected freak comes down to the world and stays. A world that remains frightening and weird even thought we call it "reality" but a world worth living in. And that's what Charlie &amp; The Chocolate Factory is all about  It all begins with a main title sequence that may be one of the main weaknesses of the film. The sequence is very entertaining and visually ambitious but they decided to go with CGI and it looks like it was a decision they made in last minute. Since the film was proudly made with "real" sets, "real" Oompas Loompas, "real" squirrels, the main title looks inappropriate. It's not that important but it's a Tim Burton film and we know how much he usually works on his main title. Hopefully, Danny Elfman is there with a crazy mix of the Edward Scissorhands and Spider-Man (the music when the title of the film appears gave me shivers), a true musical roller-coaster that gives a hint on what his score will sound like through the film. \n\nAfter that, it's just emotions. All kinds of them: laughs (many  the audience laughed almost every thirty seconds), tears of joy (we all know Charlie's gonna find that ticket but when he does, you just can't refrain your heart to beat faster), mercy (the way Burton depicts the social misery of the Bucket's family is really touching), amazement (the Wonka Factory and its many rooms is true wonder, one the most achieved design Burton ever offered us) and many mores. Very much like the book, even though it seems simple and childish, you would like to stop for a second to collect those feelings and try to analyze them but you don't have the time. It just never stops (I realize it might be a flaw for some people in fact). Burton never has been so generous in terms of human warmness.\n\nJohnny Depp proposes another inventive and completely wacky interpretation here. I won't compare with Gene Wilder since I don't know the first film very well (pretty unknown flick here in Europe) and those comparisons should stop anyway. Depp makes of Wonka a tormented and unadapted character who doesn't know much about common courtesy and doesn't really care anyway. He built up his own universe in response to his authoritarian father and he's pretty proud of it. He just doesn't want those "weird" (a word he likes  you've all seen the TV spots) and boring parents with their despicable children to ruin what is life is based on. Yet  So Depp's Wonka is actually very moving and pathetic in his attempts to entertain his visitors. As Burton does everything he can to make you hate Augustus, Vercua, Violet and Mike at the moment you first see them, you get instantly closer to Wonka when you noticed he feels the same. In addition to that, John August's vision of Wonka's past (including an always perfect cameo by Christopher Lee) offers the character a real depth you didn't expect.\n\nDanny Elfman is also one of the main attractions of the film. While his score is already classic Burton/Elfman work with some interesting experiments (the main themes are splendid), the songs he wrote for the Oompas Loompas are just so funny. Hugh laughs in the audience for some musical choices. Those songs don't intend to stay with you for months (it would have been hard as they're based on Dahl's lyrics that doesn't allow Broadway impulses), they're just off-beat numbers playing with many references in so many styles. Oingo Boingo fans have to buy the soundtrack when it'll come out, it'll bring them back 15 years ago.\n\nWhat can I tell you more ? McDowell's sets are amazing, Pescucci's work is impressive as well as Rousselot's beautiful cinematography. Some Oscar Nominations should fall here.\n\nAs for the ending, without revealing it, August's additions are really touching and fit perfectly to Burton's new approach. Even though the final shot tempers the "family" theme that he developed through the film (it's still Burton, not Disney), Burton makes you feel good because he feels good (and what I'm writing here will ring a bell when you'll see the movie). I don't know for you but after so many distressed and pessimistic films, it really moved to see that he found a certain peace. Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is a step forward in the direction he gave to his career with Big Fish. He lost his father, he became one, he's getting older and all those questions and doubts are expressed in many important and very complex images and scenes he imagined for the film. That's why I could call this film the "Edward Scissorhands" of his new period. Those films are very different but gave me both some very essential emotions.\n\nThank you, M.Burton.

The dialogue is at times both beautiful, quirky and thoughtful.\n\nI'd recommend this if you have an interest in other cultures, beautiful drawing and quirky storytelling.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3019,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2006-10-25","keywords":"racism,princess,nanny,lion,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3787964185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRkYjk4ZWUtOGE0ZC00OGQ2LWI3MWMtY2E4OTUwOTkzZDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRkYjk4ZWUtOGE0ZC00OGQ2LWI3MWMtY2E4OTUwOTkzZDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0969770/","name":"Cyril Mourali","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1947858/","name":"Karim M'Riba","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007814/","name":"Hiam Abbass"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0643664/","name":"Michel Ocelot"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085679/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102807/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036163/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0643664/","name":"Michel Ocelot"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="fr">Le papillon</title>
    <desc lang="fr">Le papillon: Directed by Philippe Muyl. With Michel Serrault, Claire Bouanich, Nade Dieu, Jacques Bouanich. This is the story of a young girl named Elsa who was raised by a single mother (Isabelle) in the city. Isabelle and Elsa begin the film moving in next door to an elderly man who collects butterflies (Julien). Isabelle who "spends a lot of time with her friends" does not pay much attention to her daughter who walks home because her mother forgot to pick her up from school. After meeting her new neighbor, Elsa finds out about the butterflies and in short annoys Julien for a while. Julien receives a mystery package from a fellow entomologist. Julien sets out on his annual attempt to find a rare species of butterfly that he had once promised his son he would find (son dead) in the French country side, specifically a region known as Vercors. Elsa stows away in his car. After being discovered she convinces him to let her come to Vercors with him. They bond while hiking and camping until Julien, who is initially annoyed by Elsa, near the end of the film seems to have a grandfather-granddaughter relationship with her. Elsa falls in a well. The police arrest Julien. Elsa tells everyone it is cool. Isabelle starts paying attention to her child. Julien and Elsa are friends. The mystery package contained a caterpillar which turned out to become the rare species of butterfly Julien set out to find. The species is called Isabelle.

You get to see plenty of all the major big name animals of Africa, though nothing you won't have especially seen before one way or another. That's not to say there are not surprises.

 --- Description: African Safari: Directed by Ben Stassen. With Dudu Douglas-Hamilton, Kevin Richardson. Filmmaker Ben Stassen and cinematographer Sean MacLeod Phillips return to southern Africa for a whole new adventure. Animal behaviorist Kevin Richardson - "The Lion Whisperer" - guides audiences on an extraordinary journey across the most spectacular sceneries on earth: from the picturesque coastal desert dunes of Namibia, through the natural wonder of the Ngorongoro crater and then on to the breathtaking Victoria Falls. The film delivers startlingly close encounters with lions, cheetahs, leopards, black rhinoceros and elephants.

I never saw the movie before, but I figured it's just a couple more bucks then if I rented it, so I bought it and watched it last night. I have to say that I'm glad I bought it because I really enjoyed it, this was a fun animated movie that got over looked in 2005. It had great actors for the voices, Mel Brooks couldn't have been a more perfect choice, the whole look of the movie is absolutely cool to look at, and the story was extremely original. This is a great film to watch for yourself or with the family.\n\nRodney is a common robot with his poor parents, but he has big city dreams to meet Bigweld, the biggest robot of all time, he is the inventor who makes sure that every robot is taken care of. Rodney goes to the big city to meet Bigweld and become an inventor himself, but ends up meeting several robots who are nobody's including Fender, his new best friend. They discover that an evil robot who has taken over Bigweld's factory is planning on destroying all the old bots who can't afford to upgrade, so pretty much that's the whole town. But Rodney and his friends are dedicated to making sure that everyone can be safe as an old bot.\n\nRobots is a very imaginative movie with a very creative story and look. I was really impressed with this movie and would highly recommend it. It has very funny moments for both the kids and the adults, so it works for a family movie very well. Robin Williams did a terrific job as Vender, he was just a great addition and brought fun comedic relief. But the whole cast sounded like they had a lot of fun with this movie. This is a fun film to watch and I think anyone could enjoy it, so grab the popcorn, because you're gonna have fun.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":137599,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2005-04-13","keywords":"robot,parents,male protagonist,title directed by male,title directed by man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robots Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi698332697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NTA1NDU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1NDgxMDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NTA1NDU1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1NDgxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Robots"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000932/","name":"Halle Berry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000316/","name":"Mel Brooks"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0917188/","name":"Chris Wedge"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757858/","name":"Carlos Saldanha"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179259/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047265/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593856/","name":"Ron Mita"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572151/","name":"Jim McClain"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1865755/","name":"David Lindsay-Abaire"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It also slightly runs out of gas towards the end, becoming a little over the top and not as crisp pacing-wise as the rest of the film. Some people may also be disappointed by the lack of emotional resonance and depth.\n\nThe animation however is wonderful (in 2D and 3D), the colours are vibrant and rich, there is so much detail and inventiveness in the backgrounds and the characters are well-modelled, cute but not overly-so. The magic scenes are very imaginatively animated too and the gizmos are cool. The House of Magic also boasts a catchy and whimsical soundtrack that compliments the film's mood ideally, and the pacing mostly is very lively in a film that can hardly be classed as 'boring'. The polished script is very high in zany wit, fun and charm, with some occasional dark weirdness that doesn't get in the way of the overall tone of the film and a whimsical quaint charm.\n\nWhile the story may not be exceptional, it is a long way from a disaster either, livened by some set pieces that are both fun and scary and some eye-popping spectacle for the magic and gizmos. The message is well-intended and sweet, and delivered in a way that doesn't preach. The characters are all cute and engaging, their likable personalities and the charming and entertaining interaction between them more than compensating for the lack of depth. The voice acting is strong.\n\nAll in all, has some imperfections in the story but is mostly a very entertaining bag of tricks with a lot of great merits. 7/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It also slightly runs out of gas towards the end, becoming a little over the top and not as crisp pacing-wise as the rest of the film. Some people may also be disappointed by the lack of emotional resonance and depth.\n\nThe animation however is wonderful (in 2D and 3D), the colours are vibrant and rich, there is so much detail and inventiveness in the backgrounds and the characters are well-modelled, cute but not overly-so. The magic scenes are very imaginatively animated too and the gizmos are cool. The House of Magic also boasts a catchy and whimsical soundtrack that compliments the film's mood ideally, and the pacing mostly is very lively in a film that can hardly be classed as 'boring'. The polished script is very high in zany wit, fun and charm, with some occasional dark weirdness that doesn't get in the way of the overall tone of the film and a whimsical quaint charm.\n\nWhile the story may not be exceptional, it is a long way from a disaster either, livened by some set pieces that are both fun and scary and some eye-popping spectacle for the magic and gizmos. The message is well-intended and sweet, and delivered in a way that doesn't preach. The characters are all cute and engaging, their likable personalities and the charming and entertaining interaction between them more than compensating for the lack of depth. The voice acting is strong.\n\nAll in all, has some imperfections in the story but is mostly a very entertaining bag of tricks with a lot of great merits. 7/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A great start for Sony Pictures Animation!","reviewBody":"What's a 'unihorn' you may ask? Well, it's a deer that only has one antler, of course. And you'll only see one in the new Sony Pictures Animation film, Open Season, starring Martin Lawrence, Debra Messing, Ashton Kutcher, Gary Sinise, Jon Favreau, and many more.\n\nMartin voices the lovable Boog in the film; he's the main attraction of a show at the zoo with his best friend, Beth (Debra Messing). Boog also lives with Beth, equipped with his stuffed animal, Dunkleman. On a completely side note, what would a Sony film be without a reference to one of their own. Before Boog settles in for his comfy night sleep, he checks out Pat Sajak on Wheel of Fortune.\n\nThey have a great life together doing shows for the fans, even exchanging powerful roars. But that's before Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) shows up, the hapless one-antlered deer who's been captured by the evil Shaw (Gary Sinise). Boog helps Elliot escape and makes Boog's and Beth's life miserable, forcing Beth to send the two animals away into the forest.\n\nOn his own for the first time, Boog now has to rely on himself, or be stuck with Elliot. And that means figuring out how to go to the bathroom in the wild. That's when he first runs into McSquizzy, the squirrel (voiced by Billy Connolly)  McSquizzy is the ruler of the forest trees, and has a great and powerful squirrel Army to back him up, equipped with thousand of acorns. Without a doubt, McSquizzy is one of the highlights of Open Season! He's got wit, humor, and a ton of Scottish charm.\n\nBoog realizes having Elliot around is the only way he'll get back to Beth. So they become 'partners,' much to the dismay of Boog  but the delight of Elliot, who just needs a friend. With hunting season right around the corner, the two must work together to sneak around the hunters.\n\nBut when Shaw breaks the hunting season date, the animals switch their thinking  instead of running away, they're going to fight back! And fight back they do! Trying to run away, Boog crosses a dam; unfortunately, his 900 pound body crumbles the wood.\n\nThat's when Open Season turns into Hill Street Blues! There is one of the most amazing chase scenes I've ever seen in the movies. Boog, Elliot, and their porcupine friend try and escape the gun shots of Shaw  but on water. Bobbing and weaving through the water, under water, above water, around rocks  great scene! There's even a waterfall at the end to top it off! I have somewhat of a test for animated movies I've been giving myself over the past few years  ever since seeing the water scenes in The Incredibles, and noticing how real it looked, I've started to take an eye to the screen. If water doesn't look real, than it doesn't pass the test. Let's just say, Open Season aced my test. This water chase scene goes on for about 5 minutes, maybe a little more; but it's so exciting and amazing to watch! It's not just the water of Open Season, it's the entire field of animation; the animals really come alive on the screen. I'm a huge fan of animation; I think it has to do with the fact that anything done with computer fascinates me. The detailed description of each character, from their eyes, nose, mouth, walk, and hair  and in this movie, fur; it's just so amazing! But back to the story - after meeting back up with the group of beavers, led by Reilly (voiced by Jon Favreau), some of Elliot's former deer mates (Patrick Warburton and Jane Krakowski), and a few other animals, Boog and Elliot team up and go on the attack against the hunters. Bras, plungers, grills, forks, knives, spoons, and basically, anything they can get their hands on  sorry, whatever they can get their paws on  they use to charge the hunters with.\n\nOpen Season is directed by Jill Culton, Roger Allers, and Tony Stacchi; each has a number of major credits to their name. Both Tony and Jill make their feature directorial debut on this film; however, Jill has worked at Pixar on the character development for Monsters Inc. and Toy Story. Tony worked on a number of films for ILM including Hook and Ghost. Roger Allers co-directed The Lion King, and has just recently completed The Little Match Girl  a short attached to The Little Mermaid.\n\nOpen Season is a fun and very enjoyable film for kids and families. It's definitely a film you'll be talking about for a long time. And don't forget, you can also check out the film in IMAX 3D, opening at major theaters across the country.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89010,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A great start for Sony Pictures Animation!","reviewBody":"What's a 'unihorn' you may ask? Well, it's a deer that only has one antler, of course. And you'll only see one in the new Sony Pictures Animation film, Open Season, starring Martin Lawrence, Debra Messing, Ashton Kutcher, Gary Sinise, Jon Favreau, and many more.\n\nMartin voices the lovable Boog in the film; he's the main attraction of a show at the zoo with his best friend, Beth (Debra Messing). Boog also lives with Beth, equipped with his stuffed animal, Dunkleman. On a completely side note, what would a Sony film be without a reference to one of their own. Before Boog settles in for his comfy night sleep, he checks out Pat Sajak on Wheel of Fortune.\n\nThey have a great life together doing shows for the fans, even exchanging powerful roars. But that's before Elliot (Ashton Kutcher) shows up, the hapless one-antlered deer who's been captured by the evil Shaw (Gary Sinise). Boog helps Elliot escape and makes Boog's and Beth's life miserable, forcing Beth to send the two animals away into the forest.\n\nOn his own for the first time, Boog now has to rely on himself, or be stuck with Elliot. And that means figuring out how to go to the bathroom in the wild. That's when he first runs into McSquizzy, the squirrel (voiced by Billy Connolly)  McSquizzy is the ruler of the forest trees, and has a great and powerful squirrel Army to back him up, equipped with thousand of acorns. Without a doubt, McSquizzy is one of the highlights of Open Season! He's got wit, humor, and a ton of Scottish charm.\n\nBoog realizes having Elliot around is the only way he'll get back to Beth. So they become 'partners,' much to the dismay of Boog  but the delight of Elliot, who just needs a friend. With hunting season right around the corner, the two must work together to sneak around the hunters.\n\nBut when Shaw breaks the hunting season date, the animals switch their thinking  instead of running away, they're going to fight back! And fight back they do! Trying to run away, Boog crosses a dam; unfortunately, his 900 pound body crumbles the wood.\n\nThat's when Open Season turns into Hill Street Blues! There is one of the most amazing chase scenes I've ever seen in the movies. Boog, Elliot, and their porcupine friend try and escape the gun shots of Shaw  but on water. Bobbing and weaving through the water, under water, above water, around rocks  great scene! There's even a waterfall at the end to top it off! I have somewhat of a test for animated movies I've been giving myself over the past few years  ever since seeing the water scenes in The Incredibles, and noticing how real it looked, I've started to take an eye to the screen. If water doesn't look real, than it doesn't pass the test. Let's just say, Open Season aced my test. This water chase scene goes on for about 5 minutes, maybe a little more; but it's so exciting and amazing to watch! It's not just the water of Open Season, it's the entire field of animation; the animals really come alive on the screen. I'm a huge fan of animation; I think it has to do with the fact that anything done with computer fascinates me. The detailed description of each character, from their eyes, nose, mouth, walk, and hair  and in this movie, fur; it's just so amazing! But back to the story - after meeting back up with the group of beavers, led by Reilly (voiced by Jon Favreau), some of Elliot's former deer mates (Patrick Warburton and Jane Krakowski), and a few other animals, Boog and Elliot team up and go on the attack against the hunters. Bras, plungers, grills, forks, knives, spoons, and basically, anything they can get their hands on  sorry, whatever they can get their paws on  they use to charge the hunters with.\n\nOpen Season is directed by Jill Culton, Roger Allers, and Tony Stacchi; each has a number of major credits to their name. Both Tony and Jill make their feature directorial debut on this film; however, Jill has worked at Pixar on the character development for Monsters Inc. and Toy Story. Tony worked on a number of films for ILM including Hook and Ghost. Roger Allers co-directed The Lion King, and has just recently completed The Little Match Girl  a short attached to The Little Mermaid.\n\nOpen Season is a fun and very enjoyable film for kids and families. It's definitely a film you'll be talking about for a long time. And don't forget, you can also check out the film in IMAX 3D, opening at major theaters across the country.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":89010,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Honestly, I love you Beth Cooper is not going to be one of those high school movie classics by no mean, but I didn't feel like my time was wasted watching it. As predictable and silly as it was, I still think this was a decent enough movie that got a few good laughs. I mean, who hasn't wanted to go all out on their high school class and just mock them on the last day of school? Not to mention get the hottie of their dreams in the same night that has them just living life to it's fullest. I think that over all the film worked, there were certain things that were flawed in the movie like the script could have used a few touch up's here and there and the cast did seem a little off. Paul Rust, it's kind of disturbing that he not only looks but is 28 years old and then you have Hayden Panettiere who looks 12 years old, it was a little  well, you get the idea.

Stepping up to the podium to deliver an inspirational speech to his graduating class, Denis decides that the time has finally come to call out his classmates on their peccadilloes and declare his love for the prettiest girl in school, Beth Cooper.

There he meets a loony (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a secret paradise. He asks two strangers, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen who was really great in her first big American Film and good looking too by the way) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) to come and join them.\n\nAfter they have found the island they meet an alternative group who lives there and they join them, but after a while problems evolve and a minor 'hell' breaks loose.\n\nThis is the plain story-line of the movie, but there is so much more to it, it has a message and that really is what fascinated me a lot in the beginning and at the end. There was a good story there, but the way it was brought over, never really losing the actual message out of sight. Now believe me the direction, the soundtrack and the cast are good. There also is a bit gore, but it fits good in the movie and is not unnecessary.\n\nYet this film is not flawless, it was good entertainment over all, yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end, but in the middle when Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) loses it, so does the film and that is a shame. It is just too weird, too long and too incomprehensible (in the sense that the viewer himself doesn't know if it is real or not). It could have been so much better, but I guess it had to be.\n\nNO MUST SEE BUT DEFINATELY WORTH A TRIP TO THE VIDEOSTORE OR TO THE CINEMA AT A DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!\n\n7 out of 10\n\nP.S. Don't agree?????, sue me!!!!!!!!!!! or mail me (see above)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":227396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There he meets a loony (Robert Carlyle) who gives him a map to a secret paradise. He asks two strangers, Françoise (Virginie Ledoyen who was really great in her first big American Film and good looking too by the way) and Etienne (Guillaume Canet) to come and join them.\n\nAfter they have found the island they meet an alternative group who lives there and they join them, but after a while problems evolve and a minor 'hell' breaks loose.\n\nThis is the plain story-line of the movie, but there is so much more to it, it has a message and that really is what fascinated me a lot in the beginning and at the end. There was a good story there, but the way it was brought over, never really losing the actual message out of sight. Now believe me the direction, the soundtrack and the cast are good. There also is a bit gore, but it fits good in the movie and is not unnecessary.\n\nYet this film is not flawless, it was good entertainment over all, yes and it was very good in the beginning and in the end, but in the middle when Richard (Leonardo DiCaprio) loses it, so does the film and that is a shame. It is just too weird, too long and too incomprehensible (in the sense that the viewer himself doesn't know if it is real or not). It could have been so much better, but I guess it had to be.\n\nNO MUST SEE BUT DEFINATELY WORTH A TRIP TO THE VIDEOSTORE OR TO THE CINEMA AT A DISCOUNT!!!!!!!!\n\n7 out of 10\n\nP.S. Don't agree?????, sue me!!!!!!!!!!! or mail me (see above)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":227396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He's been imprisoned in Tartarus for eons, which explains why he's wrathful. What is never satisfactorily explained (or even addressed) was how this mountain-sized lava monster ever procreated, since he's supposed to be the father of much smaller and more human-like gods like feuding brothers Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades.\n\n(2) Don't go in with any pre-conceived ideas based on actual Greek mythology. It's a 2011 story featuring characters left over from 2010's Clash of the Titans.\n\n(3) Warner Bros. threw a lot of money at this, and most of it shows up on the screen.\n\n(4) It's pretty much non-stop fighting (vs. chimeras, cyclopes, a minotaur, and assorted gods and demigods), not entirely at the frenetic pace of Transformers, where things are flying by too fast to figure out who's doing what to whom, but too much so for my taste.\n\n(5) The story is not going to win any Pulitzers, Nobels, or Hugos, but it's not entirely predictable, and anything that contemplates the total extinction of the gods gets a big plus from me.\n\n(6) Despite having some pretty good actors in here (Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Bill Nighy, Danny Huston, and, yes, Sam Worthington), they don't really get much chance to practice their craft, but they're not just phoning it in, either.\n\n(7) Based on the damage he absorbed, Perseus should have been dead or permanently crippled on over a dozen occasions. Absence of credible consequences makes it difficult to establish serious threats or build suspense.\n\n(8) Psychologists who are fixated on the idea of daddy complexes will love this. Normal people will spend a lot of time rolling their eyes.\n\n(9) Rosamund Pike is along for the ride as Queen Andromeda, and she gets in a few licks, but mainly she cleans up real good.\n\n(10) I'm fonder of 3-D than most, so FWIW I thot it was put to good use here in the swooping shots thru the burning villages, labyrinth, and pits of hell. Mercifully, no pokey-outy sharp things, but I had to duck the occasional flaming boulder.\n\n(11) This will not tax your intellect, but it's a well-paced, semi-interesting, action-packed ludicrously unbelievable adventure. They could have done worse, and so could you.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183529,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's a 2011 story featuring characters left over from 2010's Clash of the Titans.\n\n(3) Warner Bros. threw a lot of money at this, and most of it shows up on the screen.\n\n(4) It's pretty much non-stop fighting (vs. chimeras, cyclopes, a minotaur, and assorted gods and demigods), not entirely at the frenetic pace of Transformers, where things are flying by too fast to figure out who's doing what to whom, but too much so for my taste.\n\n(5) The story is not going to win any Pulitzers, Nobels, or Hugos, but it's not entirely predictable, and anything that contemplates the total extinction of the gods gets a big plus from me.\n\n(6) Despite having some pretty good actors in here (Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Bill Nighy, Danny Huston, and, yes, Sam Worthington), they don't really get much chance to practice their craft, but they're not just phoning it in, either.\n\n(7) Based on the damage he absorbed, Perseus should have been dead or permanently crippled on over a dozen occasions. Absence of credible consequences makes it difficult to establish serious threats or build suspense.\n\n(8) Psychologists who are fixated on the idea of daddy complexes will love this. Normal people will spend a lot of time rolling their eyes.\n\n(9) Rosamund Pike is along for the ride as Queen Andromeda, and she gets in a few licks, but mainly she cleans up real good.\n\n(10) I'm fonder of 3-D than most, so FWIW I thot it was put to good use here in the swooping shots thru the burning villages, labyrinth, and pits of hell. Mercifully, no pokey-outy sharp things, but I had to duck the occasional flaming boulder.\n\n(11) This will not tax your intellect, but it's a well-paced, semi-interesting, action-packed ludicrously unbelievable adventure. They could have done worse, and so could you.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":183529,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He is an ex-convict. She wants to help him. He thinks no one can help except himself.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0274117/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Chris Knipp"},"dateCreated":"2002-07-30","inLanguage":"English","name":"Deft, fresh crime story adds luster to director Jacques Audiard's name","reviewBody":"'Sur mes Lèvres' (`Read My Lips') is so focused on its two main characters it's claustrophobic, but the payoff is that we get inside their lives and stay inside for a very concentrated and interesting 115 minutes.\n\nJacques Audiard has crafted a unique character-driven crime movie with a fresh visual style and a compulsively watchable story.  Emmanuelle Devos won the César for her performance as Carla the deaf office worker, and she dominates the movie along with the sexy, sleazy Paul (Vincent Cassel), a recently paroled petty thief.  The movie is about their odd relationship -- mutual exploitation, let's call it -- and about the successful caper that results as well as Carla's newfound power at the busy property development company where she hires Paul, despite his complete lack of office skills, as her assistant.  It's obvious she's lonely and looks on this as a chance to get a man, but it's also a chance to have somebody to kick around the way she's been kicked around at the office, and, when she sees the value of it, a chance to use his muscle and menace to bolster her job.\n\n What neither of them anticipates is the way their mutual dependency and very different skills lead them into intimacy and crime -- not necessarily in that order.   Audiard, who co-scripted the film with Tonino Benacquista, and who's known for the richly entertaining `A Self-Made Hero' (`Un Héros Très Discret," 1996), adopts here a very selective, liquid, often claustrophobic way of filming and editing.  He uses a lot of tight close-ups, dark lighting, and fast cuts between scenes that are as rapid and unceremonious as Benoît Jacquot's in the 1998 `School of Flesh' (`L'École de la Chair'). We know we have to stay on our toes.  We're expected to pay close attention and do some thinking.\n\nWe also often feel we're spying on people from Carla's point of view, as she does when she reads the lips of gossiping coworkers for herself (and later for Paul) at the office canteen, or when at Paul's prompting she uses binoculars to read lips in a gangland nightclub owner's apartment that Paul starts casing out after he's forced because of a debt to moonlight at the club. In her apartment we see her put on Paul's bloody shirt naked after he's been beaten, or try on sexy new shoes the same way, and again the camera angle is dark and close up so we only glimpse parts of her in the dirty mirror. (There's a parallelism between iris-ed images in the movie and Carla's limited hearing.) This is an intrusive, expressionistic camera, but the editing makes us maintain an alert distance as the plot moves from Carla's initially limited existence to its transformation by the explosive personality of Paul and the more and more dangerous embroilments that happen when the two become a mutually exploitive team.\n\nWe keep seeing the characters enter into yet one more new scene that we sense is risky without quite knowing why.  Somehow we're detached and scared at the same time.  Paul and Carla each create a world of uncertainty and peril for each other.  There's a growing unease that turns into increasing excitement and danger, and finally there's Hitchcockian suspense effectively augmented by forceful cross-cutting between Carla watching the gangsters through the apartment windows after a heist and Paul manning the noisy nightclub bar, which now also has become a threatening place.\n\nThe movie has flaws.  An airline ticket seems to have wings.  Carla is too magically able to carry out Paul's instructions, gathered only from a few hastily mouthed words lip-read between two buildings.  A subplot concerning Paul's parole officer (Olivier Perrier) is superfluous and confusing. Given that so much effective use is made of varying sound levels to convey Carla's hearing with and without her two hearing aids -- turned up, turned down, or removed -- the musical background score in non-nightclub scenes is obtrusive.\n\nBut what's strong about this movie is that it has two actors with the power to dominate the screen, and a director who works with a lot of authority and freshness in presenting his vision.\n\nEmmanuelle Devos' characterization as the mousy but smart and persistent Carla is so rich and assured we may just take it for granted -- but the French film industry didn't, since they not only gave her the César, but did so in a year when the other contenders were Charlotte Rampling in `Sur la Sable,' Audrey Tautou in `Amélie,' and Isabelle Huppert in `La Pianiste." Vincent Cassel, who's said he's an instinctive actor, simply embodies his part:  it's his prison tattoo, his sleazy mustache, his oily hair, and his tall, wiry, threatening physicality that make him both repulsive and sexy as Paul.  We experience here the powerful onscreen presence that's turned him into one of the hottest young film actors in France since he starred in Mattieu Kassovitz's `La Haine' in 1995.

Emmanuelle Devos won the César for her performance as Carla the deaf office worker, and she dominates the movie along with the sexy, sleazy Paul (Vincent Cassel), a recently paroled petty thief.  The movie is about their odd relationship -- mutual exploitation, let's call it -- and about the successful caper that results as well as Carla's newfound power at the busy property development company where she hires Paul, despite his complete lack of office skills, as her assistant.  It's obvious she's lonely and looks on this as a chance to get a man, but it's also a chance to have somebody to kick around the way she's been kicked around at the office, and, when she sees the value of it, a chance to use his muscle and menace to bolster her job.\n\n What neither of them anticipates is the way their mutual dependency and very different skills lead them into intimacy and crime -- not necessarily in that order.   Audiard, who co-scripted the film with Tonino Benacquista, and who's known for the richly entertaining `A Self-Made Hero' (`Un Héros Très Discret," 1996), adopts here a very selective, liquid, often claustrophobic way of filming and editing.  He uses a lot of tight close-ups, dark lighting, and fast cuts between scenes that are as rapid and unceremonious as Benoît Jacquot's in the 1998 `School of Flesh' (`L'École de la Chair'). We know we have to stay on our toes.  We're expected to pay close attention and do some thinking.\n\nWe also often feel we're spying on people from Carla's point of view, as she does when she reads the lips of gossiping coworkers for herself (and later for Paul) at the office canteen, or when at Paul's prompting she uses binoculars to read lips in a gangland nightclub owner's apartment that Paul starts casing out after he's forced because of a debt to moonlight at the club. In her apartment we see her put on Paul's bloody shirt naked after he's been beaten, or try on sexy new shoes the same way, and again the camera angle is dark and close up so we only glimpse parts of her in the dirty mirror. (There's a parallelism between iris-ed images in the movie and Carla's limited hearing.) This is an intrusive, expressionistic camera, but the editing makes us maintain an alert distance as the plot moves from Carla's initially limited existence to its transformation by the explosive personality of Paul and the more and more dangerous embroilments that happen when the two become a mutually exploitive team.\n\nWe keep seeing the characters enter into yet one more new scene that we sense is risky without quite knowing why.  Somehow we're detached and scared at the same time.  Paul and Carla each create a world of uncertainty and peril for each other.  There's a growing unease that turns into increasing excitement and danger, and finally there's Hitchcockian suspense effectively augmented by forceful cross-cutting between Carla watching the gangsters through the apartment windows after a heist and Paul manning the noisy nightclub bar, which now also has become a threatening place.\n\nThe movie has flaws.  An airline ticket seems to have wings.  Carla is too magically able to carry out Paul's instructions, gathered only from a few hastily mouthed words lip-read between two buildings.  A subplot concerning Paul's parole officer (Olivier Perrier) is superfluous and confusing. Given that so much effective use is made of varying sound levels to convey Carla's hearing with and without her two hearing aids -- turned up, turned down, or removed -- the musical background score in non-nightclub scenes is obtrusive.\n\nBut what's strong about this movie is that it has two actors with the power to dominate the screen, and a director who works with a lot of authority and freshness in presenting his vision.\n\nEmmanuelle Devos' characterization as the mousy but smart and persistent Carla is so rich and assured we may just take it for granted -- but the French film industry didn't, since they not only gave her the César, but did so in a year when the other contenders were Charlotte Rampling in `Sur la Sable,' Audrey Tautou in `Amélie,' and Isabelle Huppert in `La Pianiste." Vincent Cassel, who's said he's an instinctive actor, simply embodies his part:  it's his prison tattoo, his sleazy mustache, his oily hair, and his tall, wiry, threatening physicality that make him both repulsive and sexy as Paul.  We experience here the powerful onscreen presence that's turned him into one of the hottest young film actors in France since he starred in Mattieu Kassovitz's `La Haine' in 1995.  (He was seen in the US last year in the enjoyable costume flick, `Le Pacte des Loups,' and is in a lot of new movies to come.)\n\nPeople are saying this is sure to lead to an American remake with big stars. Maybe so, but it's Audiard's vision that makes the picture interesting. All the Hollywood stars in the world won't take the place of Audiard's handheld camera and mercurial editing style, or a unique talent that combines sensitivity to the indignities of office workers and parolees with the ability to reinvent film noir tradition.\n\nAlso unique -- and unlikely to survive an American remake -- is the repression of sexuality between Paul and Carla, which makes the sexual tension between them seem all the more powerful throughout this tightly constructed, economical movie.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15075,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-17","keywords":"fetish,deaf woman,gangster,single woman,disappearance of sister","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0222922/","name":"Emmanuelle Devos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332709/","name":"Olivier Gourmet"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010766/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070152/","name":"Tonino Benacquista"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

From the title, I was sure I'd see a portmanteau movie of unconnected short stories, similar to 1983's "Twilight Zone: The Movie". But with a kid-centric plot and set in a small American town, the formula is similar to "It" or "Super 8". However, the episodic nature of serial "incidents" aligns it more with the style of the "Final Destination" films.\n\nStella Nicholls (Zoe Margaret Colletti) is a horror geek and aspiring writer living in Mill Valley, a small Pennsylvanian town during the Nixon election of 1968. Stella has a couple of friends: the requisite Scoobie Doo Shaggy character Chuck (Austin Zajur) and the 'sensible' "it's all science" character Auggie (Gabriel Rush). But pursued by local hoodlum Tommy (Austin Abrams), Stella, Chuck and Auggie are thrown together with draft-dodging outsider Ramón (Michael Garza).\n\nThey escape into the local spooky house - a house where legend has it that terrible things were done to a strange albini girl, Sarah. That legend has it that Sarah used to tell local kids scary stories through the walls. And Stella finds a book... a book that appears to be unfinished....\n\nThis is a time when horror films are either "old school" or more psychological in nature (like "Hereditary"). This one has Guillermo del Toro's hand behind that of lead-writers Dan and Kevin Hagerman. And it's firmly old-school. There are some effective (but at times comically created) spooky moments that are scary without being hugely gory. This earns it a UK15, rather than a UK18, certificate. It's disappointing that doesn't stretch to 12A to attract a younger teenage audience, since the source material is actually from a "Goosebumps"-like set of short stories by Alvin Schwartz.\n\nThe story's 'episodes' are nicely varied. At the gross-out end of the scale is an episode with Chuck's sister Ruth (Natalie Ganzhorn) that might get arachnophobes running for the exits. My personal favourite? A 'red room' episode with the oncoming fate comically arriving in slow-motion like the steam-roller in "Austin Powers"!\n\nThis is another film that relies on the quality of its young cast, with the only moderately well-know cast name being Gil Bellows as the local sheriff. In this regard, the stand-out performance is that of Zoe Margaret Colletti who does a fabulous job as Stella. She's been in a few films in the past ("Annie", "Wildlife" and "Skin") but this is her breakout performance in a starring role. She's done her CV a great favour here.\n\nDirected by "Troll Hunter" director André Øvredal, I really enjoyed this one. I'm not a massive fan of 'slasher' style horror films. I have no burning desire to be constantly reminded of what the inside of my body looks like. So this turned out to be much-more to my liking than the normal horror flick. It had enough spookiness to make me turn on the lights when I got back home, but not enough to pervade my dreams.\n\nThe young cast perform well. They are given enough back-story and personality by the script to make you care about their fate.\n\nSo overall, this one comes with a "Recommended for wimps" (like me)!\n\n(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook.

From the title, I was sure I'd see a portmanteau movie of unconnected short stories, similar to 1983's "Twilight Zone: The Movie". But with a kid-centric plot and set in a small American town, the formula is similar to "It" or "Super 8". However, the episodic nature of serial "incidents" aligns it more with the style of the "Final Destination" films.\n\nStella Nicholls (Zoe Margaret Colletti) is a horror geek and aspiring writer living in Mill Valley, a small Pennsylvanian town during the Nixon election of 1968. Stella has a couple of friends: the requisite Scoobie Doo Shaggy character Chuck (Austin Zajur) and the 'sensible' "it's all science" character Auggie (Gabriel Rush). But pursued by local hoodlum Tommy (Austin Abrams), Stella, Chuck and Auggie are thrown together with draft-dodging outsider Ramón (Michael Garza).\n\nThey escape into the local spooky house - a house where legend has it that terrible things were done to a strange albini girl, Sarah. That legend has it that Sarah used to tell local kids scary stories through the walls. And Stella finds a book... a book that appears to be unfinished....\n\nThis is a time when horror films are either "old school" or more psychological in nature (like "Hereditary"). This one has Guillermo del Toro's hand behind that of lead-writers Dan and Kevin Hagerman. And it's firmly old-school. There are some effective (but at times comically created) spooky moments that are scary without being hugely gory. This earns it a UK15, rather than a UK18, certificate. It's disappointing that doesn't stretch to 12A to attract a younger teenage audience, since the source material is actually from a "Goosebumps"-like set of short stories by Alvin Schwartz.\n\nThe story's 'episodes' are nicely varied. At the gross-out end of the scale is an episode with Chuck's sister Ruth (Natalie Ganzhorn) that might get arachnophobes running for the exits. My personal favourite? A 'red room' episode with the oncoming fate comically arriving in slow-motion like the steam-roller in "Austin Powers"!\n\nThis is another film that relies on the quality of its young cast, with the only moderately well-know cast name being Gil Bellows as the local sheriff. In this regard, the stand-out performance is that of Zoe Margaret Colletti who does a fabulous job as Stella. She's been in a few films in the past ("Annie", "Wildlife" and "Skin") but this is her breakout performance in a starring role. She's done her CV a great favour here.\n\nDirected by "Troll Hunter" director André Øvredal, I really enjoyed this one. I'm not a massive fan of 'slasher' style horror films. I have no burning desire to be constantly reminded of what the inside of my body looks like. So this turned out to be much-more to my liking than the normal horror flick. It had enough spookiness to make me turn on the lights when I got back home, but not enough to pervade my dreams.\n\nThe young cast perform well. They are given enough back-story and personality by the script to make you care about their fate.\n\nSo overall, this one comes with a "Recommended for wimps" (like me)!\n\n(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on t'interweb or Facebook.

Blue Velvet is his best film, and works well because of its overall logical coherency spiced up by fantastic deviations from the norm (the fantasy element of the film). This technique reminds me of Fellini's 8 1/2, where fantasy was often interspersed with a logical and coherent plot.\n\nMulholland Drive starts off logically but then gradually abandons logical coherence as dream-like (but realistically presented) sequences are brought into the plot. Then there is a shift in the plot, from the fantasy of the first part, to the reality of the second part where roles and identities are reversed and reality reigns.\n\nLynch's genius is in his artistic slight of hand where he presents a fantasy scene realistically, sucking the viewer in to expecting a meaningful depiction, then upending these expectations in shocking the viewer with the fantastic elements of the scene. I can imagine Lynch laughing in the background as he plays his joke on the viewer.\n\nThe film Holy Motors presents pure fantasy in nonsensical and unrelated sequences, and is bad art. Mulholland Drive has enough organization and structure, with more skillfully accomplished fantasy, to qualify it as good art.\n\nNaomi Watts gives us an outstanding performance - better than the typical "Best Actress" Oscar award winner's performance in the last 20 years. Watts usually gets roles that don't allow her to display her considerable acting skills, but this role does, and she more than meets the challenge.\n\nThe plot is secondary for Lynch since cinematic art is his focus. However, the movie is totally baffling unless you have some guidelines. Basically Mulholland drive is the story of a young girl who comes to Hollywood with high hopes of becoming an actress. The film is told in two parts. My interpretation is that the first (Watts as Betty) part is psychotic delusions of the young girl as she reconstructs her past leading up to the promise of a brilliant acting career. This is presented as reality and the viewer has no idea it is false. The shift to the second (Watts as Diane) part shows some shifting of roles, and depicts the true story whereby the young girl fails to become an major actress. Her identity is valid, as Diane, in the second part showing her dismal failure, while Rita of the first delusional part becomes Camilla in the second reality part.\n\nNaomi Watts thus plays two roles with different identities, in part one and in part two. The two parts are cued by the change in her name from the delusional Betty (part I) to the real Diane (part II). In a clever signal of this personality change, the waitress at Winkie's is named Diane when Betty and Rita go to eat there in the first fantasy part, while this same waitress becomes Betty when Watts as Diane goes to Winkie's in the real second part.\n\nThe plot shift from fantasy to reality mirrors the high hopes and aspirations as fantasy (Part I as Betty) and dismal failure as reality (Part II as Diane), that happens so often as young would-be performers seek fame in Hollywood but end up as failures.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":335730,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-10-19","keywords":"actress playing multiple roles,surrealism,lesbian sex,cult film,doppelganger","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mulholland Drive","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4266178073","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWViMWY2YmQtODg0MS00ZjMzLThmM2YtZTFlYjM1MGRhMmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWViMWY2YmQtODg0MS00ZjMzLThmM2YtZTFlYjM1MGRhMmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Mulholland Drive"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005009/","name":"Laura Harring"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0857620/","name":"Justin Theroux"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000186/","name":"David Lynch"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022244/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007061/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038999/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000186/","name":"David Lynch"}],"duration":"PT2H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was a delightful movie, filled with the wriest humour. Funny how synchronicity plays a big role in everything, just that morning I had had a discussion with a friend about dealing with older parents and the various issues involved. I loved the dialogue in the movie, I hope it came across as well in the sub-titles. The film focuses on relationships which are extremely varied. I thought the most interesting was between Romain and the hotelier. The interchanges were sparse but very meaningful. You could easily become the hotelier and understand his situation.

Surprisingly enough, the age gap does not mean a thing for them: they mesh like magic. It looks as if they were born the same day. One day, Madeleine escapes from the nursing home where she has been placed against her will by her sons (one of whom, Michel, is Romain's father).

It was a delightful movie, filled with the wriest humour. Funny how synchronicity plays a big role in everything, just that morning I had had a discussion with a friend about dealing with older parents and the various issues involved. I loved the dialogue in the movie, I hope it came across as well in the sub-titles. The film focuses on relationships which are extremely varied. I thought the most interesting was between Romain and the hotelier. The interchanges were sparse but very meaningful. You could easily become the hotelier and understand his situation. Other characters were off the wall such as the receptionist at the tourist bureau in Normandy and the gas bar attendant. The grandmother was a determined individual who loved every minute of life.

Alistair Little, 16 is the leader of a UVF cell, eager to be blooded. He and his gang are given the go ahead to kill a young Catholic man, James Griffin, as a reprisal and a warning to others.

Thirty years later Joe Griffin and Alistair are to meet, on camera, with a view to reconciliation. Alistair has served his sentence, and Peace may been agreed in N.

A low level civil war has been underway, with the IRA targeting British loyalists and the loyalist Ulster Volunteer Force exacting revenge on Catholics they claim are militant republicans. Alistair Little, 16 is the leader of a UVF cell, eager to be blooded. He and his gang are given the go ahead to kill a young Catholic man, James Griffin, as a reprisal and a warning to others. When the hit is carried out, Joe Griffin - the 11-year old little brother of the target - watches in horror his brother is shot in the head. Thirty years later Joe Griffin and Alistair are to meet, on camera, with a view to reconciliation. Alistair has served his sentence, and Peace may been agreed in N. Ireland, but unbeknownst to the production team, Joe Griffin, is not coming on the program for a handshake but to stick a knife in his brother's killer - live on air.

I had my doubts about Lipovsky and Stein, their portfolio is not exactly reassuring, but they have done a great job with little budget (which also, on the flip side, makes the movie feel restrained) &amp; the solid cast, including an impressive performance by the 7 year old Lexy Kolker, helps greatly.\n\n"Freaks" is a take on mutant mythos, much like the more shinier "X-Men" movies, but this time freshened up by some different creative decisions in script writing. However, as the story unraveled, sadly, it turned out that the questions asked were more interesting than the answers received. The filmmakers had nailed the world-building during the first half, structuring the plot carefully, giving it piece by piece. Themes like childhood curiosity, extreme parenting &amp; dystopian horrors are explored. The lesser flaw is the pacing, it's a slow-burn long before it is action, but it's never really boring. The big flaw, though, is how actually straight forward and routine the story is, hidden carefully behind the aforementioned world-building. Clever choices, but the resolution/s in the story are therefore less surprising and less impactful. Nevertheless, we have an interesting main hero, Chloe, a 7 years old girl whose head we live in throughout the movie. Most of the characters were decent if a little (or more) clichéic &amp; the performances carrying them - great. For one I feel like Bruce Dern literally never fails. "Freaks" are clothed in a fine cinematography that doesn't exactly excel, but, given the budget, the production design, FX and editing is well done and do not ruin or damage the viewing experience.\n\n"Freaks" has a handful of great elements but doesn't quite pack the punch it promises to. Originality is something it seems to possess, but, as the credits are rolling and I put the whole thing together in retrospect, it's more convential than it wants to be. This goes out as a recommendation to the fans of ambitious sci-fi indies, non-Hollywood superhero movies &amp; mysterious little thrillers.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 8781414, Title: Freaks, 
 --- Description: Freaks: Directed by Zach Lipovsky, Adam B. Stein. With Emile Hirsch, Bruce Dern, Grace Park, Amanda Crew. A bold girl discovers a bizarre, threatening, and mysterious new world beyond her front door after she escapes her father's protective and paranoid control." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt8781414/","name":"Freaks","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDIzNDk0YWYtZjQwZC00NTljLWFiNDktYzRkNDc0MWY5NWQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A bold girl discovers a bizarre, threatening, and mysterious new world beyond her front door after she escapes her father's protective and paranoid control.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt8781414/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"TwistedContent","dateCreated":"2019-11-28","inLanguage":"English","name":"Well Acted, Cleverly Written and Also Underwhelming","reviewBody":"A much awaited sci-fi indie for sure, from early positive festival buzz to a neat trailer to a both pleasantly surprising &amp; slightly underwhelming result. I had my doubts about Lipovsky and Stein, their portfolio is not exactly reassuring, but they have done a great job with little budget (which also, on the flip side, makes the movie feel restrained) &amp; the solid cast, including an impressive performance by the 7 year old Lexy Kolker, helps greatly.\n\n"Freaks" is a take on mutant mythos, much like the more shinier "X-Men" movies, but this time freshened up by some different creative decisions in script writing. However, as the story unraveled, sadly, it turned out that the questions asked were more interesting than the answers received. The filmmakers had nailed the world-building during the first half, structuring the plot carefully, giving it piece by piece. Themes like childhood curiosity, extreme parenting &amp; dystopian horrors are explored. The lesser flaw is the pacing, it's a slow-burn long before it is action, but it's never really boring. The big flaw, though, is how actually straight forward and routine the story is, hidden carefully behind the aforementioned world-building. Clever choices, but the resolution/s in the story are therefore less surprising and less impactful. Nevertheless, we have an interesting main hero, Chloe, a 7 years old girl whose head we live in throughout the movie. Most of the characters were decent if a little (or more) clichéic &amp; the performances carrying them - great. For one I feel like Bruce Dern literally never fails. "Freaks" are clothed in a fine cinematography that doesn't exactly excel, but, given the budget, the production design, FX and editing is well done and do not ruin or damage the viewing experience.\n\n"Freaks" has a handful of great elements but doesn't quite pack the punch it promises to. Originality is something it seems to possess, but, as the credits are rolling and I put the whole thing together in retrospect, it's more convential than it wants to be. This goes out as a recommendation to the fans of ambitious sci-fi indies, non-Hollywood superhero movies &amp; mysterious little thrillers. My rating: 7/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30152,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-09-13","keywords":"father daughter relationship,super power,escape,neighbor,ice cream truck","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2870918169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM3OWVkYWMtZjM0OC00MGNlLWExOGQtODZlNGQ1N2RhMWYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM3OWVkYWMtZjM0OC00MGNlLWExOGQtODZlNGQ1N2RhMWYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A disturbed father (Emile Hirsch) locks his bold 7-year-old daughter (Lexy Kolker) in a house, warning her of grave dangers outside.

Add to the mix the danger of bringing a much-loved novel to life on screen, and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—based on John le Carré's book—throws an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up, making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key characters—most of whom go by at least two names—the film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed, particularly considering its reserved pace; the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression, constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film, the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache; indeed, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed therein—the brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shot—an extreme close-up of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow— affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids, giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of, and familiarity with, this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast; a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display: a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt, Hardy to Cumberbatch, Oldman to Dencik, the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together, each actor inhabiting their character with award-courting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisation—an all-too often underutilised aspect in this genre—each of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage, but ours is with them: exploring their motivations; their private lives; their loyalties; and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities, but rather human beings with emotions, afflicted by the agonies of their toils, burying themselves in vodka-laced punch to just get away from it all.\n\nHitting all the right notes in its performances, script, and direction, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity, questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives. Shot with unforgettable effulgence—committing to memory eternal every last contour of Oldman's storied brow—it is a genuine achievement in cinematic storytelling.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Add to the mix the danger of bringing a much-loved novel to life on screen, and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—based on John le Carré's book—throws an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up, making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key characters—most of whom go by at least two names—the film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed, particularly considering its reserved pace; the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression, constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film, the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache; indeed, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed therein—the brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals.

This is a fine thriller.\n\nFrom the get-go viewers understand that an intelligent maniac is on the loose, and could strike at any time. That is the very definition of cinematic tension. In addition, the killer uses dark, subterranean spaces to torture and kill victims. That inky darkness, together with a haunting musical score further amplifies suspense.\n\nBut, the solution to the whodunit puzzle is ultimately unsatisfying because the screenwriter withholds important back-story from viewers. This could have been so easily fixed with the addition of a line or two of dialogue and/or a brief added scene near the film's beginning. Even so, good plot misdirection creates ample red herrings, so that the killer's identity is not a foregone conclusion.\n\nThe film's cinematography, production design, and editing are fine. Washington does a good job as the paralyzed cop. But Angelina Jolie is miscast; she pouts her way through the film looking like she's bored out of her mind. The support cast helps a lot, with highly credible performances from delightful Queen Latifah, capable Ed O'Neill, and reliable Michael Rooker.\n\nThe crime scenes tended unfortunately to be in-your-face grizzly. But at least the gore quotient was minimal.\n\nFor dark, moody serial killer films set in NYC, I prefer "Sea Of Love" (1989). Nevertheless, "The Bone Collector" can be enjoyed for its elevated level of suspense, its fine cinematography, and its generally high level of acting. Be advised, however, that the film's finale may be a disappointment if you expect all the whodunit puzzle pieces to fall into place, neat and tidy."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159386,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was co-written and directed by Stéphane Brizé. \n\nIn a short introduction before the film began, the presenter pointed out the the actual translation of the French title would be "The Law of the Market." Both titles tell us something about the plot of the movie. "The Measure of a Man" emphasizes the basic humanity of the protagonist. "The Law of the Market" emphasizes the basic inhumanity of the marketplace-driven society in which he lives.\n\nVincent Lindon plays Thierry Taugourdeau, who has lost his skilled labor job because of a factory closure. (Other displaced workers want to sue the company for pulling out of France to go elsewhere. Apparently, this isn't legal if the company is making a profit in France. However, Thierry isn't interested.)\n\nThierry is accustomed to getting a good salary in a respected job. As the film opens, we learn that he has taken a three-month course in order to learn how to be a crane operator. He informs the government employment counselor that the course was worthless. Companies will only employ crane operators that are already experienced construction workers. Why did they advise him to take a course that couldn't lead to employment?\n\nThe film continues in the same vein. Thierry truly wants to work to support himself, his wife, and his son with cerebral palsy. (The son is portrayed by Matthieu Schaller, who does indeed have cerebral palsy.)\n\nWe follow Thierry from frustration to frustration as nothing he does brings him employment. Finally, he obtains employment, and that is where the measure of a man begins.\n\nThis is a fascinating--but painful--movie to watch. We're accustomed to unhappy stories in which the protagonists are down-and-out, and the situation is hopeless. This plot doesn't fit into that mold. Thierry has had a comfortable, middle-class life. He's intelligent and resourceful. Even so, he can't counter the forces of society that tell him that he and his family have to move down a notch--or more--in order to survive.\n\nVincent Lindon is brilliant in this role. We can identify with him and it is not a comfortable feeling. Lindon won the Best Actor award at Cannes for this portrayal, and I'm not surprised. It's worth seeing this film just for an opportunity to watch a superb actor succeeding in a difficult role.\n\nWe saw this film in the excellent Dryden Theatre in Rochester's George Eastman Museum. It was shown a part of the outstanding Rochester Labor Film Series. \n\nFor reasons I don't understand, this movie has a dismal IMDb rating of 6.8. Possibly, reviewers found it simply too depressing. Yes, it's depressing, but it reflects reality, and I think it's definitely worth seeking out. It's available on DVD and Blu-Ray.

However, films about politicians and those around them seem to be more successful than the politicians themselves. A good example in this regard is 'Alice et le maire' ('Alice and the Mayor') a film that comes from France, a country that seems to be in recent years in a permanent state of dissatisfaction with the existing economic and social order, with its political institutions and with members of the political class. The film, whose action takes place a few years ago at the City Hall of Lyon and in the milieu of the municipal and political bureaucracy of the Socialist Party, enjoyed an unexpected success without even resorting to sensationalist issues such as crime, sex, or corruption scandals. Perhaps precisely through the relaxed and slightly humorous approach, the script written by Nicolas Pariser (who is also the director of the film) reaches more effectively aspects of deeper, systemic corruption of the French political machinery.\n\nHowever, the premises of the story do not seem too credible. I am not very familiar with the French political system, but I believe that even in France there are no positions for philosophers advisers to the mayors, paid on public money, nor that politicians with decades of political activity and presidential ambitions publicly declare that they are short of ideas. Probably, then, only in the films Alice (Anaïs Demoustier), a fresh graduate from Oxford, could she employed at the City Hall in Lyon just to provide ideas to Mayor Paul Theraneau (Fabrice Luchini) and that could become in a few days or weeks involved at top level in the affairs of the city and of the Socialist Party. The activity of the party on the public money of the town hall also seems little plausible. Probably the whole situation should be viewed more as a cinematic convention rather than real events in the immediate actuality. But even so, the dialogues between the mayor and the young philosopher represent the guiding thread and the most successful and probably the most important part of the movie from the point of view of the filmmakers.\n\nThe discussions between the two protagonists work very well thanks to the charm and the talent of the two actors. The mayor's role is written for Fabrice Luchini who lends to the character his noble style, intellectual charisma and impeccable French language, serving us even with a reading from a book, one of those that made him famous in France. Anaïs Demoustier copes well with the scenes that she shares with Luchini, but also with those that describe her personal dilemmas and the confrontation with the municipal bureaucracy. Secondary roles create believable portrait sketches of Alice's friends and of the politicians and bureaucrats in the town hall hierarchy. The story, however, stumbles badly towards the end, when the politician's decision or indecision at critical moments is difficult to understand, perhaps due to the use of details related to party politics. French viewers might be better off deciphering such details as well as some of the literary and cultural references appearing in discussions, but cinematically the story does not hold water. The approach of 'Alice and the Mayor' is comical and empathetic towards the heroes, the ending is open, so what we get is pleasant entertainment around a political topic. Of course, there will be other films that will address the troubled French political actuality with different approaches and from many other points of view.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"lyon france,mayor,politics,female protagonist,year 2017","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2747252249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1326732/","name":"Anaïs Demoustier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3937233/","name":"Nora Hamzawi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093091/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625796/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, films about politicians and those around them seem to be more successful than the politicians themselves. A good example in this regard is 'Alice et le maire' ('Alice and the Mayor') a film that comes from France, a country that seems to be in recent years in a permanent state of dissatisfaction with the existing economic and social order, with its political institutions and with members of the political class. The film, whose action takes place a few years ago at the City Hall of Lyon and in the milieu of the municipal and political bureaucracy of the Socialist Party, enjoyed an unexpected success without even resorting to sensationalist issues such as crime, sex, or corruption scandals. Perhaps precisely through the relaxed and slightly humorous approach, the script written by Nicolas Pariser (who is also the director of the film) reaches more effectively aspects of deeper, systemic corruption of the French political machinery.\n\nHowever, the premises of the story do not seem too credible. I am not very familiar with the French political system, but I believe that even in France there are no positions for philosophers advisers to the mayors, paid on public money, nor that politicians with decades of political activity and presidential ambitions publicly declare that they are short of ideas. Probably, then, only in the films Alice (Anaïs Demoustier), a fresh graduate from Oxford, could she employed at the City Hall in Lyon just to provide ideas to Mayor Paul Theraneau (Fabrice Luchini) and that could become in a few days or weeks involved at top level in the affairs of the city and of the Socialist Party. The activity of the party on the public money of the town hall also seems little plausible. Probably the whole situation should be viewed more as a cinematic convention rather than real events in the immediate actuality. But even so, the dialogues between the mayor and the young philosopher represent the guiding thread and the most successful and probably the most important part of the movie from the point of view of the filmmakers.\n\nThe discussions between the two protagonists work very well thanks to the charm and the talent of the two actors. The mayor's role is written for Fabrice Luchini who lends to the character his noble style, intellectual charisma and impeccable French language, serving us even with a reading from a book, one of those that made him famous in France. Anaïs Demoustier copes well with the scenes that she shares with Luchini, but also with those that describe her personal dilemmas and the confrontation with the municipal bureaucracy. Secondary roles create believable portrait sketches of Alice's friends and of the politicians and bureaucrats in the town hall hierarchy. The story, however, stumbles badly towards the end, when the politician's decision or indecision at critical moments is difficult to understand, perhaps due to the use of details related to party politics. French viewers might be better off deciphering such details as well as some of the literary and cultural references appearing in discussions, but cinematically the story does not hold water. The approach of 'Alice and the Mayor' is comical and empathetic towards the heroes, the ending is open, so what we get is pleasant entertainment around a political topic. Of course, there will be other films that will address the troubled French political actuality with different approaches and from many other points of view.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"lyon france,mayor,politics,female protagonist,year 2017","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2747252249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg2NTJjOWEtNDEwNy00MGJjLWE4MjQtOWQxY2U2Zjc0OGI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524528/","name":"Fabrice Luchini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1326732/","name":"Anaïs Demoustier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3937233/","name":"Nora Hamzawi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093091/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625796/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3033662/","name":"Nicolas Pariser"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Kumail is an amateur stand-up comedian. He meets &amp; falls in love with Emily(Zoe Kazan). Kumail &amp; Emily become a couple. Now they have to decide whether their relationship has a future, due to the massive difference in their cultures. This makes things between Kumail &amp; Emily, complicated. \n\nThe Big Sick is a fantastic movie. What is fascinating about this film is that, it's based on the real life love story of Kumail(who also wrote the film) &amp; co-writer of the script, Emily V. Gordon. Director Michael Showalter has done a bang-up job, balancing the romantic, comedic &amp; dramatic elements of the movie. This film is laugh-out- loud funny but, it can also make you feel emotional, from time to time. The performances are spot on. Kumail Nanjiani is brilliant as Kumail. Zoe Kazan is spectacular as Emily. Nanjiani &amp; Kazan share an adorable &amp; effortless chemistry, in all their scenes together. Holly Hunter is outstanding as Beth. Ray Romano is awesome as Terry. Anupam Kher is superb as Azmat. Zenobia Shroff is great as Sharmeen. Adeel Akhtar is excellent as Naveed. Bo Burnham, Aidy Bryant, Kurt Braunohler &amp; Shenaz Treasurywala are impressive as CJ, Mary, Chris &amp; Fatima, respectively. The Big Sick is a must watch for romantic comedy fans. Go for it, as soon as you can.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124673,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Kumail is an amateur stand-up comedian. He meets &amp; falls in love with Emily(Zoe Kazan). Kumail &amp; Emily become a couple. Now they have to decide whether their relationship has a future, due to the massive difference in their cultures. This makes things between Kumail &amp; Emily, complicated. \n\nThe Big Sick is a fantastic movie. What is fascinating about this film is that, it's based on the real life love story of Kumail(who also wrote the film) &amp; co-writer of the script, Emily V. Gordon. Director Michael Showalter has done a bang-up job, balancing the romantic, comedic &amp; dramatic elements of the movie. This film is laugh-out- loud funny but, it can also make you feel emotional, from time to time. The performances are spot on. Kumail Nanjiani is brilliant as Kumail. Zoe Kazan is spectacular as Emily. Nanjiani &amp; Kazan share an adorable &amp; effortless chemistry, in all their scenes together. Holly Hunter is outstanding as Beth. Ray Romano is awesome as Terry. Anupam Kher is superb as Azmat. Zenobia Shroff is great as Sharmeen. Adeel Akhtar is excellent as Naveed. Bo Burnham, Aidy Bryant, Kurt Braunohler &amp; Shenaz Treasurywala are impressive as CJ, Mary, Chris &amp; Fatima, respectively. The Big Sick is a must watch for romantic comedy fans. Go for it, as soon as you can.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124673,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is shamelessly sentimental and is built on a series of absurd coincidences, but the amazing thing is it all works. The coincidences could feel like a shameless plot device but instead there is just a sense of wonderful magic, as though somehow the foundling the movie is built around lives an oddly charmed existence that transforms the lives of those around it. \n\nThe movie does a wonderful job of making its characters both broad but human. This is not one of those cheesy movies that make homeless people seem ultimately wiser and nobler than the rest of us, but while they are all deeply flawed they all have a redeeming warmth. \n\nThe movie is both very funny and very touching, and is really about the miracle of love in a world of harsh realities. If you're not willing to totally suspend your disbelief and give in to the movie's blatant flouting of all concepts of reality then you'll probably hate it, but if you want a charming fable this is a great choice.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33905,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-11-08","keywords":"family relationships,homeless,baby,tokyo japan,transgender","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi867483161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E0MmUzZjktYzhmZi00NzZhLWFmZGUtZmRhNmFhMTcyNzg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E0MmUzZjktYzhmZi00NzZhLWFmZGUtZmRhNmFhMTcyNzg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256609/","name":"Tôru Emori"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0880851/","name":"Yoshiaki Umegaki"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0645464/","name":"Aya Okamoto"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464804/","name":"Satoshi Kon"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022946/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464804/","name":"Satoshi Kon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0633730/","name":"Keiko Nobumoto"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is shamelessly sentimental and is built on a series of absurd coincidences, but the amazing thing is it all works. The coincidences could feel like a shameless plot device but instead there is just a sense of wonderful magic, as though somehow the foundling the movie is built around lives an oddly charmed existence that transforms the lives of those around it. \n\nThe movie does a wonderful job of making its characters both broad but human. This is not one of those cheesy movies that make homeless people seem ultimately wiser and nobler than the rest of us, but while they are all deeply flawed they all have a redeeming warmth. \n\nThe movie is both very funny and very touching, and is really about the miracle of love in a world of harsh realities. If you're not willing to totally suspend your disbelief and give in to the movie's blatant flouting of all concepts of reality then you'll probably hate it, but if you want a charming fable this is a great choice.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33905,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-11-08","keywords":"family relationships,homeless,baby,tokyo japan,transgender","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi867483161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E0MmUzZjktYzhmZi00NzZhLWFmZGUtZmRhNmFhMTcyNzg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E0MmUzZjktYzhmZi00NzZhLWFmZGUtZmRhNmFhMTcyNzg1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256609/","name":"Tôru Emori","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0880851/","name":"Yoshiaki Umegaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0645464/","name":"Aya Okamoto"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464804/","name":"Satoshi Kon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022946/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464804/","name":"Satoshi Kon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0633730/","name":"Keiko Nobumoto"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

We can think of EYE OF THE BEHOLDER, Marc Behm's masterpiece.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-02-17","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296594/","name":"Catherine Frot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0050210/","name":"Jeanne Balibar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0220017/","name":"Julie Depardieu"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196797/","name":"Josée Dayan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0230892/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0203404/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053642/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0754259/","name":"Sylvain Saada","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0708084/","name":"Catherine Ramberg"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Christine is quite believable as manager of the Paris branch of a multinational (fake name, Barney Johnson, but mainly shown on their office paper) in product strategies for food, perfectly cast here as business woman. The main offices are in America (New York and Washington, so there are some English dialogs with executives from these offices, very short) and we see Isabelle going to Cairo (although surely not filmed there). She is not so believable as being the 2nd in command. I was not so aware of her having such high position until a Japanese delegation wants a picture with the 2 top managers of this firm (her and Christine). The work environment is quite unbelievable,just designer office rooms with a desk on which you almost don't see them doing anything and in the meetings they are in, nothing is discussed, only showing the ends of these meetings. But this movie is about the power struggle between these 2 and who they use and abuse for their purpose of getting to the top (Christine is aiming at a job in the head office in New York). This is the best part of the movie. Isabelle is extremely fanatical about her work, which means everything to her, she has no friends (as Sagnier said in a Dutch interview). This hard-working Isabelle does the best work but Christine claims it as having been hers on 3 occasions. Isabelle both admires (loves) and hates Christine. Christine says at one point that she loves Isabelle. Both have a love-affair with the same colleague, who at a certain moment is being blackmailed by Christine, much to the disgust of Isabelle. It all turns wrong when Christine shows security camera pictures of Isabelle having gotten angry and having a car accident in the garage and humiliates her in front of all their colleagues at a party, where she already felt uncomfortable, not talking with anyone. Christine meant it as a joke, she said, but her degrading remarks to Isabelle show otherwise. The rest of the movie is all about Isabelle's quite-clever-or-not revenge, which I won't reveal here (one can find more than enough about that already). It's all not terribly surprising or great cinema, but it is an entertaining thriller which grips you from beginning to end, despite some incredibleness. I think money is well spent on going to this movie, especially if you're a fan of Kristin Scott Thomas, who speaks excellent French and is great here, as usual. 104 minutes, some flashbacks in black and white. If you liked "La Tourneuse de Pages", this comes close, at least in the beginning.

Christine is quite believable as manager of the Paris branch of a multinational (fake name, Barney Johnson, but mainly shown on their office paper) in product strategies for food, perfectly cast here as business woman. The main offices are in America (New York and Washington, so there are some English dialogs with executives from these offices, very short) and we see Isabelle going to Cairo (although surely not filmed there). She is not so believable as being the 2nd in command. I was not so aware of her having such high position until a Japanese delegation wants a picture with the 2 top managers of this firm (her and Christine). The work environment is quite unbelievable,just designer office rooms with a desk on which you almost don't see them doing anything and in the meetings they are in, nothing is discussed, only showing the ends of these meetings. But this movie is about the power struggle between these 2 and who they use and abuse for their purpose of getting to the top (Christine is aiming at a job in the head office in New York). This is the best part of the movie. Isabelle is extremely fanatical about her work, which means everything to her, she has no friends (as Sagnier said in a Dutch interview). This hard-working Isabelle does the best work but Christine claims it as having been hers on 3 occasions. Isabelle both admires (loves) and hates Christine. Christine says at one point that she loves Isabelle. Both have a love-affair with the same colleague, who at a certain moment is being blackmailed by Christine, much to the disgust of Isabelle. It all turns wrong when Christine shows security camera pictures of Isabelle having gotten angry and having a car accident in the garage and humiliates her in front of all their colleagues at a party, where she already felt uncomfortable, not talking with anyone. Christine meant it as a joke, she said, but her degrading remarks to Isabelle show otherwise. The rest of the movie is all about Isabelle's quite-clever-or-not revenge, which I won't reveal here (one can find more than enough about that already). It's all not terribly surprising or great cinema, but it is an entertaining thriller which grips you from beginning to end, despite some incredibleness. I think money is well spent on going to this movie, especially if you're a fan of Kristin Scott Thomas, who speaks excellent French and is great here, as usual. 104 minutes, some flashbacks in black and white. If you liked "La Tourneuse de Pages", this comes close, at least in the beginning. I have seen it twice now (2 pre-premieres) and must say the beginning remains fascinating, whereas the second part becomes weaker the more you see it, but it still is an ingenious detective plot, a tribute to this much too young deceased (67) film-maker.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5269,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-08-18","keywords":"taupe pantyhose,female stockinged legs,pantyhose,suntan pantyhose,female boss","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Love Crime","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1858509849","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMTQwNDE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg2ODEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMTQwNDE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg2ODEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When Christine, a powerful executive, brings on a naive young ingÃ©nue as her assistant, she delights in toying with her naivete and teaching her hard lessons in a ruthless professional philosophy.

I do not deny the biological success achieved. But I do believe that the authors owe the adult audience more transparency about the ins and outs of their project.

Purely agricultural, or eco-tourism, or even cinematographic (this film being then the completion of the project, the farm itself being then only a by-product of the financial project)?\n* what is the financial track record of the operation?

Although it is far from a straightforward genre film, its atmosphere still reeks of spectres &amp; phantasmagoria.\n\nThe story concerns the family of a retired general on trial for war crimes, and the unraveling they undergo after the arrival of a mysterious domestic help. There is a haunting quality to the way it is filmed, plus the horror aspects are finely utilised too yet it fails to immerse us completely into its world and never goes all-in with the retribution that was always coming which is a shame, for more could've been done here.\n\nOverall, La Llorona makes for a gripping story about the voids that never fill and scars that never heal, and also serves as a chilling metaphor of the blood-soaked history of Guatemala that's still crying for closure. Not a film for all and certainly not for those expecting something alone the lines of the terrible Hollywood take on the Latin American fable, this Guatemalan feature is a political drama pierced with thin lines of horror &amp; fantasy."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4735,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Although it is far from a straightforward genre film, its atmosphere still reeks of spectres &amp; phantasmagoria.\n\nThe story concerns the family of a retired general on trial for war crimes, and the unraveling they undergo after the arrival of a mysterious domestic help. There is a haunting quality to the way it is filmed, plus the horror aspects are finely utilised too yet it fails to immerse us completely into its world and never goes all-in with the retribution that was always coming which is a shame, for more could've been done here.\n\nOverall, La Llorona makes for a gripping story about the voids that never fill and scars that never heal, and also serves as a chilling metaphor of the blood-soaked history of Guatemala that's still crying for closure. Not a film for all and certainly not for those expecting something alone the lines of the terrible Hollywood take on the Latin American fable, this Guatemalan feature is a political drama pierced with thin lines of horror &amp; fantasy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4735,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The first time I saw it I didn't think it was very funny, but when I went back to see it a second time I was laughing plenty of times. The film also teaches an important lesson that if you have a good life you should not give it up for anything. If Shrek had never met Fiona or any of his friends they all would have had rough lives. Overall, the movie is a great conclusion to the film series.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":192432,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-06-02","keywords":"ogre,donkey,alternate timeline,friend,deal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shrek Forever After: Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2299660057","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NDAzMzI2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI1OTM0Mw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NDAzMzI2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDI1OTM0Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A bored and domesticated Shrek pacts with deal-maker Rumpelstiltskin to get back to feeling like a real ogre again, but when he's duped and sent to a twisted version of Far Far Away -- where Rumpelstiltskin is king, ogres are hunted, and he and Fiona have never met -- he sets out to restore his world and reclaim his true love.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000552/","name":"Eddie Murphy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593610/","name":"Mike Mitchell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458441/","name":"Josh Klausner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501359/","name":"Darren Lemke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0825308/","name":"William Steig"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This can work out of some viewers' favor, but shouldn't provide a problem for the majority of audience members.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":102510,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2009-10-16","keywords":"based on children's book,creature,imagination,fantasy world,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Where the Wild Things Are -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3225158169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTY0NjAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2NjYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTY0NjAzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQ2NjYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The second theatrical trailer for Spike Jonze's Where the Wild Things Are, an adaptation of Maurice Sendak's children's book.

It is an updated version of Thomas Hardy's Far from the Madding Crowd but based on a graphic novel by Posy Simmonds. A dark comedy set in the English countryside, the story is centred on a writer's colony run by Tamsin Greig's character Beth and her crime writer husband Nicholas, played by Roger Allam.\n\nGemma Arteton plays the title character who lived in the same small down in Dorset known as Ewedown during her teenage years. Now grown up she returns to restore and hopefully sell the house she used to live in. With help from a surgically reconstructed nose, Tamara Drewe has blossomed into a beautiful woman and her presence shakes the sleepy town as Bethsheba did in Hardy's novel.\n\nThe film is true to the memory of Thomas Hardy maintaining the turmoil of sexual desire and even obsession across all age groups which so commonly adorned his novels. One of the characters, the sympathetic American novelist Glen played by Bill Camp is writing a novel influenced by Hardy and references the author on many occasions.\n\nThe film breaks the notion of a quiet and sleepy town, like so many British films do. Underneath these seemingly close communities lies an underlining suspicion. Everyone is in everyone else's business in Ewedown and Tamara's presence only helps fuel the tension.\n\nThe pivotal scene that embodies Tamara Drewe's character occurs when Glen tells her that life must be very easy for her because she is beautiful. She laughs it off citing that it has always been difficult for her to be taken seriously.\n\nBehind the character of Tamara Drewe lies something more sinister. The sudden appearance of a beautiful face in the town leads to a series of events that causes the balance of everyone's life to be upset. Men are suddenly smitten by the prospect of sex while women are often jealous or angry by the disruption they cause.\n\nThe story really begins to escalate when Tamara begins to date a drummer in a rock band played by Dominic Cooper and sets up permanently in the town. Soon, everyone in the town is invested in the lives of these people in some way.\n\nThe voyeurism of the locals who regard Tamara Drewe as both someone to envy and detest is likened to the celebrity status of her rock star boyfriend. Tamara quickly becomes the target of two schoolgirls who are both obsessed with the drummer and jealous of Tamara for disturbing the order of things.\n\nThe film eases its dark themes with its excellent use of subtle humour. The updated version of one of Hardy's most celebrated novels exposes the reality of a voyeuristic society too concerned with the lives of other people.\n\nAlong with Frears excellent direction, the other great strength of this film is its actors with special distinction going to Tamsin Greig. Greig is familiar to the London stage scene while others have played minor roles in big films. Gemma Arteton was one of Bond's muses in the Quantum of Solace. Roger Allam has been equally excellent in Frears academy award winning film the Queen as well as in V for Vendetta.\n\nOn one final note, I read one review that argued that the climax just does not amount to much which I personally felt was very misguided. The ending was true to the traditions of Hardy which is what Tamara Drewe is all about.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21314,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-09-10","keywords":"scantily clad female,lust,hot pants,underwear,bare butt","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tamara Drewe","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2479556121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2NzcxOTc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk2Njg3Mw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA2NzcxOTc5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk2Njg3Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young newspaper writer returns to her hometown in the English countryside, where her childhood home is being prepped for sale."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2605345/","name":"Gemma Arterton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1812656/","name":"Luke Evans"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1002641/","name":"Dominic Cooper"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001241/","name":"Stephen Frears"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104115/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315381/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0799654/","name":"Posy Simmonds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1620490/","name":"Moira Buffini"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Was Olivier Assayas drunk and/or high when he put this together? It's a complicated slog of a film that is dull and boring and makes no sense, that the 127 min runtime felt like 5 hours.

There, Solomon witnesses numerous acts of cruelty that no man should ever face.\n\nAs I stared at the movie screen with full dread, I was reeling back at certain scenes I had just witnessed. There were good films and television shows about slavery before, and they had various nuances at how to tackle slavery. This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of "Django Unchained" and "The Butler". But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen's "12 Years a Slave" shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.\n\nSteve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.\n\nCentral to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears.

There, Solomon witnesses numerous acts of cruelty that no man should ever face.\n\nAs I stared at the movie screen with full dread, I was reeling back at certain scenes I had just witnessed. There were good films and television shows about slavery before, and they had various nuances at how to tackle slavery. This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of "Django Unchained" and "The Butler". But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen's "12 Years a Slave" shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.\n\nSteve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.\n\nCentral to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.\n\nA fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender's portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.\n\nI was left speechless as the credits rolled.

Both are valid observations and comments on today's society, whether we, the viewers, happen to agree with them or not.\n\nThe film also has a touch of originality which isn't easy to do these days when so many movies have already been made. Yes there are studies out there of psychos, yes there are films that vilify the media and there are films about morbid voyeurism and about the exploitation of victims of crime for personal gain. The originality comes from putting them all together. I couldn't really think of a parallel, although others might.\n\nThis is well worth watching.

As I wrote above ,the affair between a handsome priest and a lovely nun is only a detail in a dense screenplay :it's really love at first sight , the nun lets her hair down and presto ,they act .One must note that the marriage for catholic priests (the protestant ministers do ,I personally attended a baptism held but a female minister )is hardly brought up ,which is amazing all the same (although pope François is modern,there are many conservatives among the cardinals ,one hears ....)\n\n In direct contrast with this bourgeois religious people , we have Frederico ,the black priest:he's the only one who does what the Gospels told us a long time ago; he denounces the sad fate of Brazilian's peasants where 1% of the population owns almost half of the land ;he comes to the rescue of the emigrants cooped in like animals in Calais ,waiting to head for England (not in a hurry to welcome them);he shares their food ,not the high and mighty's miniature pastries ,and their straw mattress.He is good friends with Charles whose family likes him too ,although he's too leftist .But the viewer sides with him :\n\nTemporary stricken with remorse , Charles who did not lift a finger to help his fellow men,too busy with his broadcasts,his scouts ,his books ,the receptions his love affair ; he wants to confess him to his devoted friend .And that' s it.Nothing will stop him on his way to the bishop's palace ....\n\nMarion Sarraut ,the seasoned director (who has done a lot of work for TV) , does not take sides ;it seems that she approves of the mother's obnoxious behavior ; the ending fails totally to convince .\n\nI was brought up a catholic and I went to Sunday school for long years;now I stand aloof from this religion ; if all the priests were like Frederico,the good Samaritan......"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-30","keywords":"female nudity,topless female nudity,sex scene,washing up","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2720118/","name":"Stanley Weber"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7230577/","name":"Mathilde Ollivier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479628/","name":"Dominique Labourier"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765532/","name":"Marion Sarraut"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011409/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0125554/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0124813/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456997/","name":"Jacques Kirsner"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As I wrote above ,the affair between a handsome priest and a lovely nun is only a detail in a dense screenplay :it's really love at first sight , the nun lets her hair down and presto ,they act .One must note that the marriage for catholic priests (the protestant ministers do ,I personally attended a baptism held but a female minister )is hardly brought up ,which is amazing all the same (although pope François is modern,there are many conservatives among the cardinals ,one hears ....)\n\n In direct contrast with this bourgeois religious people , we have Frederico ,the black priest:he's the only one who does what the Gospels told us a long time ago; he denounces the sad fate of Brazilian's peasants where 1% of the population owns almost half of the land ;he comes to the rescue of the emigrants cooped in like animals in Calais ,waiting to head for England (not in a hurry to welcome them);he shares their food ,not the high and mighty's miniature pastries ,and their straw mattress.He is good friends with Charles whose family likes him too ,although he's too leftist .But the viewer sides with him :\n\nTemporary stricken with remorse , Charles who did not lift a finger to help his fellow men,too busy with his broadcasts,his scouts ,his books ,the receptions his love affair ; he wants to confess him to his devoted friend .And that' s it.Nothing will stop him on his way to the bishop's palace ....\n\nMarion Sarraut ,the seasoned director (who has done a lot of work for TV) , does not take sides ;it seems that she approves of the mother's obnoxious behavior ; the ending fails totally to convince .\n\nI was brought up a catholic and I went to Sunday school for long years;now I stand aloof from this religion ; if all the priests were like Frederico,the good Samaritan......","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-30","keywords":"female nudity,topless female nudity,sex scene,washing up","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2720118/","name":"Stanley Weber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7230577/","name":"Mathilde Ollivier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0479628/","name":"Dominique Labourier"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765532/","name":"Marion Sarraut"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011409/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0125554/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0124813/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456997/","name":"Jacques Kirsner"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is a slapstick-heavy family movie that should delight young children and keep parents entertained.\n\nThe Croods are the last remaining family in an arid desert landscape. They have survived by following family patriarch Grug's (Nicolas Cage) rules to the letter, including staying in the cave after dark and fearing anything that seems new (new is BAAAD). Despite this, teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) wants to break free and rebels against her father, which results in a chance meeting with the highly inventive Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who warns her that the end of the world is nigh. When the Croods' cave is destroyed, the family is forced on a journey into a strange new world where Grug's rules clash with Guy's techniques for survival.\n\nThe Croods is a formulaic movie that sticks to a traditional hero's journey and relies on typical archetypes, but it's elevated by the writing and direction of Kirk DeMicco and How to Train Your Dragon's Chris Sanders. Like Sanders' previous work, The Croods focuses on a family's dynamic and relationships. This time, the focus is on a protective father who wants to protect his family physically and protect his daughter from a member of the opposite sex who suddenly challenges his position as the alpha male. While the trailers and first half of the movie made is seem Eep was the main character, it's actually Grug who goes through the greatest change and learns the biggest lessons.\n\nThe story is one about learning, exploring, and using one's intelligence. It also touches on the idea that it's unhealthy to live a sheltered life. But at times, the movie lays it on a bit too much with Guy and his "solutions" leaving Grug on the losing end.\n\nMost of the humour used in The Croods is very physical and slapstick oriented. Characters have Loony Toons levels of invincibility as they endure intense physical pain. This type of humour obviously appeals to fairly young children, but I would be lying if I said I did not laugh at the film at all. The Croods avoids using crude toilet humour to generate cheap laughs. There is not much in the way of verbal humour, but there are some running gags, and modernisms are kept to a minimum. They are still there but they are more putting modern products in a Stone Age setting, a little like The Flintstones, so they serve more as pop-cultural winks to adults.\n\nAs expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. It's quick and fluid, and the camera flows nicely as it follows the action. The Croods themselves have a seemingly unpleasant, bulky design to them but it actually works in the context of the film because the characters live in the wild, so big and broad makes sense. It is a little refreshing to see the main female character is not made out to be a stunning beauty, but rather someone who has been shaped by her environment. The beginning of the movie starts with in dry, mono-coloured landscapes before we get to see the bright colours of the jungle and continually seeing the weird creature reminiscence of designs of Sanders' previous works.\n\nLike other animated movies these days, The Croods has a big name voice cast and they also do a decent, if standard job. No one disgraces themselves. Cage is an unusual choice, but he gives a strong performance. There is only one time when Cage is let off the handle; Unfortunately, that is when we are experiencing the most modernism the movie has to offer.\n\nThe Croods is not going to match the heights of DreamsWorks major hits of Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon. But it certainly does not belong with the dregs the studio has to offer. It does what it sets out to do: make a movie that will please children while attempting to give a positive message and some heart. It has an old-fashioned sense of humour that leads to a surprisingly enjoyable animated movie.\n\nPlease visit www.entertainmentfuse.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201412,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"caveman,journey,cave,survival,strict father","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi126265113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The world's very first prehistoric family goes on a road trip to an uncharted and fantastical world."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000092/","name":"John Cleese"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He speaks few Arab and doesn't know much about them or about their history. Fahrid considers himself as a Frenchman and discovers an entire new world just across the Mediterranean Sea thanks to his cousin. Unfortunately, his cousin steals his passport from him and eventually leaves the country with it. Fahrid must then deal with the local and french bureaucracy while his cousin starts behaving badly in France.\n\nMy comment: the story of the movie itself isn't what's interesting in it. The scenery is great, actors are authentic. We don't "see" Algeria, we can smell it, feel it and even the sun can burn your skin through the screen. I never went to Algeria, and I don't have anything to do with this country. I never planned to go there and I never thought I'd say this one day: this movie made me love the country. I want to add "visit Algeria" in my "to do list". \n\nFahrid's statement at the end clearly explains what the movie is dealing with. He says "I still don't know if my experience is good or bad. but I'm not the same guy anymore". \n\nGreat movie, congratulations","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":633,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-06-19","keywords":"lawyer","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416126/","name":"Tewfik Jallab"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213354/","name":"Jamel Debbouze"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4238622/","name":"Fatsah Bouyahmed"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5627015/","name":"Mohamed Hamidi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098808/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142567/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044140/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5627015/","name":"Mohamed Hamidi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0086912/","name":"Alain-Michel Blanc"}],"duration":"PT1H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He speaks few Arab and doesn't know much about them or about their history. Fahrid considers himself as a Frenchman and discovers an entire new world just across the Mediterranean Sea thanks to his cousin. Unfortunately, his cousin steals his passport from him and eventually leaves the country with it. Fahrid must then deal with the local and french bureaucracy while his cousin starts behaving badly in France.\n\nMy comment: the story of the movie itself isn't what's interesting in it. The scenery is great, actors are authentic. We don't "see" Algeria, we can smell it, feel it and even the sun can burn your skin through the screen. I never went to Algeria, and I don't have anything to do with this country. I never planned to go there and I never thought I'd say this one day: this movie made me love the country. I want to add "visit Algeria" in my "to do list". \n\nFahrid's statement at the end clearly explains what the movie is dealing with. He says "I still don't know if my experience is good or bad. but I'm not the same guy anymore". \n\nGreat movie, congratulations","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":633,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-06-19","keywords":"lawyer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416126/","name":"Tewfik Jallab","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213354/","name":"Jamel Debbouze","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4238622/","name":"Fatsah Bouyahmed"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5627015/","name":"Mohamed Hamidi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098808/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142567/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044140/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5627015/","name":"Mohamed Hamidi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0086912/","name":"Alain-Michel Blanc"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest. The film takes place in the not-too-distant future.\n\nBrad Pitt stars as Roy McBride, in what may be his career best (and most inward-looking) performance. Roy is the son of NASA hero Clifford McBride (Tommy Lee Jones), the leader of The Lima Project - a decades old mission to Neptune tasked with searching for extraterrestrial life. The elder McBride has long been assumed dead with no signals or response signs in many years. A recent power surge that threatens humanity has been traced to Neptune, and now Roy is being used as bait to track down his rogue astronaut father and prevent him from causing further damage.\n\nRoy's assignment requires him to journey from Earth to the Moon to Mars and, ultimately, on to Neptune. Along the way, he travels with Colonel Pruitt (Donald Sutherland), an old friend of Clifford's, who is sent along to make sure the son doesn't acquiesce to the father. Of course, it's a nice touch to have Tommy Lee Jones and Donald Sutherland together again in a space movie 20 years after SPACE COWBOYS, a more upbeat adventure. Here we see a populated moon - yet another place we humans have messed up - replete with turf wars. There is also a shootout in a space capsule, and an unscheduled stop that provides shocking visuals and causes a shift in the crew.\n\nJames Gray, who directed the vastly underrated THE LOST CITY OF Z (2016) delivers a space film with terrific visuals and a script he co-wrote with Ethan Gross, that examines how a father can affect the life of his son even when he's not present. The film has an unusual pace to it. There are a few action sequences, but the core of the film is the psychological state of son versus absent father. Roy's inability to connect with loved ones is displayed through flashbacks involving Liv Tyler, and it's his own narration that provides us much more insight than his regularly scheduled psychological tests.\n\nRuth Negga (LOVING) has a nice turn as Helen Lantos, one of the key officials at the Mars space station, and her encounter with Roy provides him with yet more background on his father. It's easy to recall both APOCALYPSE NOW (only with Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Kurtz) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY given the isolation, questionable mental state, and mission-gone-wrong. The cinematography Hoyte Van Hoytem (DUNKIRK) is outstanding, and never allows us to forget Roy is in space ... with danger present in every moment. The title translates "to the stars", and it's true in every sense.\n\nMr. Gray has delivered a thought-provoking big budget science fiction film. It has incredible special effects, but the personal story packs even more punch than the galactic adventure. Many will compare this to other space films like CONTACT, GRAVITY, and FIRST MAN, but this one requires more investment from the viewer, as it's the character study that resonates. This is Brad Pitt's movie (he's in most every scene), and the ties to his father are never more evident than when he (and we) see The Nicholas Brothers performing in black and white on that monitor. If a daily psychological profile was required for each of us, it would be interesting to see how much work would actually be accomplished. Now, imagine yourself stationed in space and just try to keep your heartrate below 80!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":206553,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Astronaut Roy McBride's pulse rate may never go above 80 bpm, but mine certainly did during the opening sequence which features a stunning and spectacular space fall. It's unlike anything we've seen before. Roy has trained his entire life for this work; however his true mental state is only revealed slowly throughout the film's run. After witnessing his actions and hearing (through narration) his thoughts, we are left to decide what we think of Roy ... stoic hero or simmering psychopath? Either way, he's haunted by a past that has rendered him mission-focused and the world's worst party guest.

Jerry Orbach is great as Lennie, and I was stunned to learn that he also played the voice of Lumiere, the French candlestick in Beauty and the Beast! His sarcastic one-liners never fail to get me laughing, and he and his new partner, Jesse L. Martin as Ed Green, have a good rapport and are believable as partners. On the "Order" side, Sam Waterston, Dianne Wiest, and Elisabeth Rohm are equally compelling. New cast member Rohm has gotten better as she's gone along; she had big shoes to fill as Angie Harmon's replacement. Because the stories are all driven by the plots, and not the characters' personal lives, it makes the constant cast turnover more believable. It's a testament to Dick Wolf and co. that such a smart, sharp show has stayed on the edge after almost 12 years! My only beef is I'm tired of hearing "Ripped from the headlines" in every promo. That, though, is a minor quibble. Wednesday nights wouldn't be the same without it!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1990-09-13","keywords":"shared universe,copaganda,profanity,ampersand in title,punctuation in title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001583/","name":"Jerry Orbach","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0552509/","name":"Jesse L.

For every action there's a consequence. For every weeknight there's a Law &amp; Order . Here we meet the Detectives and Prosecutors with a duty to bring Law &amp; Order to New York City , in this series appears prestigious actors as Jerry Orbach, Jesse L Martin , Sam Waterston, Epatha Markeson ,Michael Moriarty , Elizabeth Rohm , Carolyn MacCormick ,Carey Lowel, Leslie Hendrix, Dennis Farina , JK Simmons , Anne Parish and many others . Protagonists of the series' longest-serving cast members that were not there when the series ended lasted far longer than the ones that replaced them. Interesting and overlong TV series dealing with investigation of heinous crimes presented from the perspectives of an expert police force and the prosecutors who accuse at criminal court . As in the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate, yet equally important groups : the police, who investigate crime and the district attorneys, who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories . As the toughest cases requires the toughest justice when dealing with the worst criminals meet the people who deal with them on their level. Long running TV drama produced by Dick Wolf, Warren Leight ,Rene Balcer , Arthur Fornier ,Ted Kotcheff and usual musical score by Mike Post , it tells the stories of two different yet equally important teams , the main : the cops who investigate crimes , carried out by the law enforcement and the public attorney at law who prosecute the offenders . The matter is then taken over by the prosecutors of the Manhatten District Attorney's office, who discuss deals and plea bargains, prepare the witnesses and evidence all whilst conducting the people's case in the trial of the accused. Dealing with the cops pursue the delinquents and the subsequent criminal justice system with spectacular trials . In NYC the dedicated detectives that investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite special of expert policemen . In the complex process of determining guilt and innocence, lives often hang in the balance.\n\nNice show that follows a murder , from two separate vantage points, the police investigation and the prosecution in court , including judge , jury , solicitor and prosecutor ; it delves into the more ominous offenses and grisly killings , investigating the crimes committed in NYC , usually adapted from current headlines, . Many people mistake this to mean that they are based on real events. In reality, the slogan is referring to the show's practice of coming up with stories that are partially inspired by recent headlines.. Both teams , Cops and Prosecutors , work together as well as with the Medical Examiners Office, Crime Lab and Police and District Attorney psychologists or psychiatrists. At the same time the protagonists are attemting to balance the consequences of the investigations on their own lives .\n\nThe series displays great actors , many of the actors on Law &amp; Order were also regular cast members on HBO series The Wire .

All three of the series' longest-serving cast members lasted far longer than those they replaced: Jerry Orbach (Detective Lennie Briscoe) (1992-2004) lasted twelve years and replaced Paul Sorvino (Sergeant Phil Ceretta) who lasted only a year and a half (1991-1992); S. Epatha Merkerson (Lieutenant Anita Van Buren) (1993-2010), was with the series for seventeen seasons, replaced Dann Florek (Captain Don Cragen), who lasted three years (1990-1993); Sam Waterston (Executive District Attorney/District Attorney Jack McCoy) (1994-2010), who was with the series for sixteen seasons, replaced Michael Moriarty (Executive Assistant District Attorney Ben Stone), who lasted four years (1990-1994) .The series is well directed by good filmmakers as Ernest Dickerson ,Gabrielle Beaumont , Kristopher Tabori, alan Taylor , Eric Stoltz , Bruce Seth Green , Rick Wallace , Adam Bernstein , Fred Gerber , David Platt , Richard Dobbs , Matthew Penn , Jean de Segonzac , Michael Pressman , Arthur W.

I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.\n\nHaving said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.\n\nThere is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.\n\nIt is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.\n\nYes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.\n\nThe scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier.

I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.\n\nHaving said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.\n\nThere is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Game of Thrones is one such show.\n\nIt is complex, multi-layered, surreal, vibrant, imaginative and it draws your eye in to the surprising level of detail, from the sweeping vistas, to the narrow dungeons, from the beautiful castles and magnificent trees, to the contrasting landscapes. It is worth watching just for the scenery alone.\n\nYes the acting seems a little cold and even wooden at times, but this is perfectly in keeping with the medieval look and feel of the show. Yes it is dark and gloomy, but again in keeping with the narrative.\n\nThe scripting is intelligent and well delivered by competent acting, led by Sean Bean perfectly cast as Lord Edard. Although Sean Bean is better known for brooding bad guys, he strikes the perfect balance between father, husband and Lord and soldier. He is well supported by other well known actors and many new to the scene.\n\nAfter watching and sometimes enjoying Camelot, this show makes that one look more like "Merlin" by comparison. And where Camelot lacks in depth and scripting, Game of Thrones strikes the perfect balance between brooding medieval angst and wonderful fantasy story telling.\n\nEven if you have never watched a fantasy show before, you should not miss this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1861856,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":9.2,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2011-04-17","keywords":"based on novel,dragon,politics,nudity,queen","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3592338/","name":"Emilia Clarke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0227759/","name":"Peter Dinklage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3229685/","name":"Kit Harington"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0335036/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167350/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1125275/","name":"David Benioff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1888967/","name":"D.B.

Both this film and Michael Bay's "The Rock" received the Criterion treatment at one time. And while both are very enjoyable films, do they really belong with Criterion? I feel that by merely being released by them, there is an added importance stamped on the film.\n\nBut as far as guilty pleasures go, this is a fun and entertaining film. I could do without the romance angle, but the idea of blowing up an asteroid before it hits earth (which assumes a lot of questionable science) is just classic science fiction, here given more legitimacy and budget than ever before.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":402115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT2H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Both this film and Michael Bay's "The Rock" received the Criterion treatment at one time. And while both are very enjoyable films, do they really belong with Criterion? I feel that by merely being released by them, there is an added importance stamped on the film.\n\nBut as far as guilty pleasures go, this is a fun and entertaining film. I could do without the romance angle, but the idea of blowing up an asteroid before it hits earth (which assumes a lot of questionable science) is just classic science fiction, here given more legitimacy and budget than ever before.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":402115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT2H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That Neville is a former scientist who is immune to the deadly strain is a bonus as it means he can work on a potential cure.\n\nYes it's daft, and yes it's contrived, but there sure is a lot of good stuff to enjoy before the films major failing surfaces. Firstly is Will Smith's performance, there is no doubting he is a major star these days, but here he also cements his standing as a bona fide A lister of note. He layers the performance so well, his character not only has to deal with the heavy threat of being killed by the mutants at night, he also has to fight his own isolation, mans inherent need for companionship is a tortured thing when you appear to be the sole beneficiary of gods green earth.\n\nSecondly the setting of a barren desolate New York is eerily staggering, overgrown with foliage and stalked by lions searching for food, it really is a big screen must to embrace the scope of it. Thirdly the mutants themselves are scary enough, but they honestly would have been better served being played by human actors rather than the CGI used that brings very mixed results, and fourthly the tension building is pitch perfect, the makers manage to have you on the edge of your seat gasping for a solution to this cracking story unfolding, but then...\n\nThey throw it all away by a rushed ending that had me positively seething, a quick turn of events should be a prelude to a fully fleshed out finale but instead we get a quick wham bam, oh The End. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth on leaving the cinema and frankly the audience deserves better, and in fact so does Will Smith, did they run out of money? Well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame that. 6.5/10\n\nFootnote: Having just watched the alternate version that is readily available on disc formats, I have to say that as weak and as frustrating as the theatrical ending is, the alternate ending is far worse, trite and totally misplaced, they chose the better ending of the two for sure.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":701719,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That Neville is a former scientist who is immune to the deadly strain is a bonus as it means he can work on a potential cure.\n\nYes it's daft, and yes it's contrived, but there sure is a lot of good stuff to enjoy before the films major failing surfaces. Firstly is Will Smith's performance, there is no doubting he is a major star these days, but here he also cements his standing as a bona fide A lister of note. He layers the performance so well, his character not only has to deal with the heavy threat of being killed by the mutants at night, he also has to fight his own isolation, mans inherent need for companionship is a tortured thing when you appear to be the sole beneficiary of gods green earth.\n\nSecondly the setting of a barren desolate New York is eerily staggering, overgrown with foliage and stalked by lions searching for food, it really is a big screen must to embrace the scope of it. Thirdly the mutants themselves are scary enough, but they honestly would have been better served being played by human actors rather than the CGI used that brings very mixed results, and fourthly the tension building is pitch perfect, the makers manage to have you on the edge of your seat gasping for a solution to this cracking story unfolding, but then...\n\nThey throw it all away by a rushed ending that had me positively seething, a quick turn of events should be a prelude to a fully fleshed out finale but instead we get a quick wham bam, oh The End. It leaves a bitter taste in the mouth on leaving the cinema and frankly the audience deserves better, and in fact so does Will Smith, did they run out of money? Well that I don't know, but what I do know is that we so nearly had a genre classic to look fondly on for years to come, shame that. 6.5/10\n\nFootnote: Having just watched the alternate version that is readily available on disc formats, I have to say that as weak and as frustrating as the theatrical ending is, the alternate ending is far worse, trite and totally misplaced, they chose the better ending of the two for sure.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":701719,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was really excited about this movie and looking forward to seeing it ever since the previews came out. But, boy!, was I disappointed. All of the cute stuff (and pretty much the only cute stuff) was contained in those previews.\n\nThere is nothing original, and nothing funny enough or well-acted enough to make its unoriginality interesting. Jennifer Aniston did a decent job, given what she had to work with (though she does act like she does in most of her other movies). But the writing wasn't good, and the plot was weak and all over the place. Most everything you see, you've seen before--just done better somewhere else--and all of it combined into something very hodgepodge.

I had no idea the music would make such a difference, normally I don't notice it's even there. Not so on this one! It was often agonizingly out of place, where you had to wonder what the score writers were thinking, or why they picked the song they did.\n\nI left twice for the concession stand, and didn't even care to ask what had happened while I was gone. There were times I found that I was even having to remind myself to pay attention to the dialogue. As I don't go to the theater often, it's usually a treat to me, and most of the time I enjoy whatever I'm watching simply because it's relaxing and a chance to be out. But for once I was actually bored. It was about the quality of a TV show, but unfortunately lasted the length of a full movie.\n\nThe romantic/action with husband and wife fighting-yet-finding-they-might-still-love-each-other plot has been done before much better. "Mr and Mrs Smith" was GOOD. "Fool's Gold" was decent. "Bounty Hunter" was just downright poor.

I found this film and immediately I enjoyed it.Recently the German directors have made some films about the ommunity service .In "Die Diebin und der General" a young woman who has committed shoflifting must do a community service in a retirement home where she must take care for the grumpiest old man where stays there.In "Der Kotzbrocken" a young mother who hasn't traffic fee must do a community serive in a desability residencialk center where she has to care with a bad tempered man.There is also the story of "Unser Kindermädchen ist ein Millionär" in which Max Helmer , the son of a very rich family doesn't want to study o participate in the family business and his father sends him to work for some weeks as housekeeper in the house of a siingle mother with many children.Now I go back to "Dieses bescheuerte Herz" !!The story is quite interesting: young man living a careless life (in nightclub with friends), a workaholic father who is doctor.Then an incident : the car in the swimming and the father, very angry decides to put the things in order obliging his son to take care for a young adolescent who has a strong heart disease.Then comes the first encounter and little by little the friendship between Lenny and David. It's very good with a good mixture of drama and comedy with a touch of humor .When Lenny asks his father what he will do with the boy, his father recomends him a bucket list and the ideas works very well ( the boy begins really to live the life). The performance of Philip Noah Schwarz and Elyas M'Barek are really great.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2888,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-12-21","keywords":"singing in a car,driving a car into a swimming pool,car in a swimming pool,male vomiting,female doctor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4136614681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGViNjllN2EtMDc3NS00N2ZmLTg5ZGQtYzNlMTI1NzNjODNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGViNjllN2EtMDc3NS00N2ZmLTg5ZGQtYzNlMTI1NzNjODNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065929/","name":"Elyas M'Barek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9973558/","name":"Philip Noah Schwarz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942158/","name":"Nadine Wrietz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0745131/","name":"Marc Rothemund"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066350/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0673297/","name":"Maggie Peren"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736623/","name":"Andi Rogenhagen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4514663/","name":"Daniel Meyer"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I found this film and immediately I enjoyed it.Recently the German directors have made some films about the ommunity service .In "Die Diebin und der General" a young woman who has committed shoflifting must do a community service in a retirement home where she must take care for the grumpiest old man where stays there.In "Der Kotzbrocken" a young mother who hasn't traffic fee must do a community serive in a desability residencialk center where she has to care with a bad tempered man.There is also the story of "Unser Kindermädchen ist ein Millionär" in which Max Helmer , the son of a very rich family doesn't want to study o participate in the family business and his father sends him to work for some weeks as housekeeper in the house of a siingle mother with many children.Now I go back to "Dieses bescheuerte Herz" !!The story is quite interesting: young man living a careless life (in nightclub with friends), a workaholic father who is doctor.Then an incident : the car in the swimming and the father, very angry decides to put the things in order obliging his son to take care for a young adolescent who has a strong heart disease.Then comes the first encounter and little by little the friendship between Lenny and David. It's very good with a good mixture of drama and comedy with a touch of humor .When Lenny asks his father what he will do with the boy, his father recomends him a bucket list and the ideas works very well ( the boy begins really to live the life). The performance of Philip Noah Schwarz and Elyas M'Barek are really great.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2888,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-12-21","keywords":"singing in a car,driving a car into a swimming pool,car in a swimming pool,male vomiting,female doctor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4136614681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGViNjllN2EtMDc3NS00N2ZmLTg5ZGQtYzNlMTI1NzNjODNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGViNjllN2EtMDc3NS00N2ZmLTg5ZGQtYzNlMTI1NzNjODNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1065929/","name":"Elyas M'Barek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9973558/","name":"Philip Noah Schwarz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942158/","name":"Nadine Wrietz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0745131/","name":"Marc Rothemund"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066350/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0673297/","name":"Maggie Peren","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736623/","name":"Andi Rogenhagen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4514663/","name":"Daniel Meyer"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I went through PI in 1957. The time period in the picture would have been about 1967, since the in-country sequence includes the '68 Tet Offensive. Little had changed in those 10 years except the switch from M1s to M16s. \n\nFor the most part Kubrick got Parris Island right on the money. And why shouldn't he have, since his screen DI, Lee Ermey was in fact a real DI before he started acting (he played another DI in "The Boys of Company C," an earlier and lesser Vietnam flick)? He had a built- in technical adviser. The screams and insults and profanity and physical punishment were all part of the DIs armamentarium. When you're facing up to 75 young strangers you need to immediately establish absolute authority and hang on to it for 13 weeks. Furthermore, you want to break the breakable as soon as you can. My platoon had its Private Pyles and though none ended up as he does in "Full Metal Jacket," I remember that they simply disappeared from our ranks, never to be heard from again. Nothing Ermey as Sgt. Hartman does is exaggerated.\n\nKubrick, however, does exaggerate. Speaking of Pyle's ending, it's almost impossible for me to imagine that a recruit could manage to sneak a clip of live rounds away from the rifle range. Every shooter at the range has his own rifle coach, and every single round is very carefully accounted for. Kubrick started the killing one scene too early.\n\nI've read that DIs nowadays are forbidden to use the time-honored f-word, and are not allowed to lay hands on recruits. I don't know if that's good or bad for training (I had my face slapped hard my first day of boot camp and that was just for openers), but then all of us old-timers like to brag about how tough it useta be!\n\nA final note: It's interesting to compare "Full Metal Jacket" to another attempt at a portrayal of Parris Island, Jack Webb's "The DI," made around '55 or '56. Webb tries for authenticity, but as I was to learn a year or so later, his PI was a boy scout camp.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":698533,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1987-07-10","keywords":"military,vietnam war,drill instructor,u.s. marine,boot camp","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Full Metal Jacket - Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3225663513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU0ZmYwNmUtMzc2Mi00ZjYxLWE2MjctY2Q1NjE1NmZiOTJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU0ZmYwNmUtMzc2Mi00ZjYxLWE2MjctY2Q1NjE1NmZiOTJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000546/","name":"Matthew Modine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000388/","name":"R.

I went through PI in 1957. The time period in the picture would have been about 1967, since the in-country sequence includes the '68 Tet Offensive. Little had changed in those 10 years except the switch from M1s to M16s. \n\nFor the most part Kubrick got Parris Island right on the money. And why shouldn't he have, since his screen DI, Lee Ermey was in fact a real DI before he started acting (he played another DI in "The Boys of Company C," an earlier and lesser Vietnam flick)? He had a built- in technical adviser. The screams and insults and profanity and physical punishment were all part of the DIs armamentarium. When you're facing up to 75 young strangers you need to immediately establish absolute authority and hang on to it for 13 weeks. Furthermore, you want to break the breakable as soon as you can. My platoon had its Private Pyles and though none ended up as he does in "Full Metal Jacket," I remember that they simply disappeared from our ranks, never to be heard from again. Nothing Ermey as Sgt. Hartman does is exaggerated.\n\nKubrick, however, does exaggerate. Speaking of Pyle's ending, it's almost impossible for me to imagine that a recruit could manage to sneak a clip of live rounds away from the rifle range. Every shooter at the range has his own rifle coach, and every single round is very carefully accounted for. Kubrick started the killing one scene too early.\n\nI've read that DIs nowadays are forbidden to use the time-honored f-word, and are not allowed to lay hands on recruits. I don't know if that's good or bad for training (I had my face slapped hard my first day of boot camp and that was just for openers), but then all of us old-timers like to brag about how tough it useta be!\n\nA final note: It's interesting to compare "Full Metal Jacket" to another attempt at a portrayal of Parris Island, Jack Webb's "The DI," made around '55 or '56. Webb tries for authenticity, but as I was to learn a year or so later, his PI was a boy scout camp.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":698533,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1987-07-10","keywords":"military,vietnam war,drill instructor,u.s. marine,boot camp","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Full Metal Jacket - Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3225663513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU0ZmYwNmUtMzc2Mi00ZjYxLWE2MjctY2Q1NjE1NmZiOTJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU0ZmYwNmUtMzc2Mi00ZjYxLWE2MjctY2Q1NjE1NmZiOTJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000546/","name":"Matthew Modine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000388/","name":"R.

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Films like "Children of Men", "Looper", and "The Road" have greatly contributed to this sub-genre which, in reality, is not really new, but is constantly being redefined and given different treatments : "Children of Men" was an ode to life, "Looper" felt a lot like a modern-day western, "The Road" was a classic tale of a father-and-son relationship, and now, "Elysium", a thriller/action film/social commentary about disparity between the rich and the poor. Neill Blomkamp burst out of the scene in 2009 with "District 9", a very similar project in several regards, and blew audiences away with a clever mix of documentary-style filmmaking, explosive action, and the refreshing implement of an obvious social commentary.\n\n"Elysium" starts off brilliantly, showcasing two opposite environments: the old Earth, which has turned into a huge ghetto where people live like cattle, and Elysium, a high-end space station where all the wealthy people from Earth have moved to establish their home. We are then introduced to our protagonist, Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), whose quest is quickly defined after being exposed to deadly radiation : With five days left to live, Max will ally up with a group of illegal immigrants to get to Elysium so he can get the proper medical attention he needs. But Secretary Rhodes (Jodie Foster), an evil government executive in charge of defending Elysium, will stand in his way, by hiring Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a psychopathic mercenary in charge of neutralizing all illegal immigrants.\n\nThe first third of "Elysium" is both fascinating and stressful : You are being introduced to the over-populated Earth, its hospitals, its industrial plants, its streets. These images are very reminiscent of the Johannesburg ghettos depicted in "District 9". And then, you get to see glimpses of the wonderful Elysium, a visual tour-de-force that ends up being shamefully underused in the film. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation, the film jumps into a nerve-racking tone, and it is very effective, as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common.\n\nUnfortunately, the pace slows down in the second third, where Max's story gets sidelined a bit, to the profit of a few sub-plots that involve an unpredictable, yet not so major twist in terms of impact on the story, as well as a sub-story involving the daughter of an old friend of Max. And while the twist is a welcome addition, the sub-story comes a little out of nowhere and comes off as a bit of a cliché. It seemed like Blomkamp was trying to preserve this family theme that was dear to him in "District 9", and that served the story so well in his previous film. Its unusual aspect prevented it from being too clichéd (an alien dad and his alien son), which is unfortunately not the case in "Elysium". It does not ruin the film, but it does steal its share of precious screen time in a film that feels a tad too short, and leads it towards more conventional developments.\n\nThen the pace picks up again, with a third act that consists mostly of a bunch of pretty awesome action/fighting sequences, where the feeling of urgency from the original quest has pretty much left the building. In terms of writing, this is conventional stuff, but the technical expertise behind the visuals and the sound is a thing of beauty. Also, the dramatic elements displayed in the first third are briefly brought back to seal the deal, and do provide a satisfying feeling of closure to the story.\n\nOverall, this is quality entertainment with impressive visuals, and a world of ideas that had infinite potential. And while "Elysium" exploited only a fraction of its potential, what it did exploit it did it successfully. Directing, photography, music, and performances are all superb. With a decent yet a bit unoriginal social commentary in the background that does get shelved in the second half to the profit of rock-solid action sequences, the strengths of "Elysium", taken individually, do feel a bit scattered, but make for an overall very competent package.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":424635,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Films like "Children of Men", "Looper", and "The Road" have greatly contributed to this sub-genre which, in reality, is not really new, but is constantly being redefined and given different treatments : "Children of Men" was an ode to life, "Looper" felt a lot like a modern-day western, "The Road" was a classic tale of a father-and-son relationship, and now, "Elysium", a thriller/action film/social commentary about disparity between the rich and the poor. Neill Blomkamp burst out of the scene in 2009 with "District 9", a very similar project in several regards, and blew audiences away with a clever mix of documentary-style filmmaking, explosive action, and the refreshing implement of an obvious social commentary.\n\n"Elysium" starts off brilliantly, showcasing two opposite environments: the old Earth, which has turned into a huge ghetto where people live like cattle, and Elysium, a high-end space station where all the wealthy people from Earth have moved to establish their home. We are then introduced to our protagonist, Max Da Costa (Matt Damon), whose quest is quickly defined after being exposed to deadly radiation : With five days left to live, Max will ally up with a group of illegal immigrants to get to Elysium so he can get the proper medical attention he needs. But Secretary Rhodes (Jodie Foster), an evil government executive in charge of defending Elysium, will stand in his way, by hiring Kruger (Sharlto Copley), a psychopathic mercenary in charge of neutralizing all illegal immigrants.\n\nThe first third of "Elysium" is both fascinating and stressful : You are being introduced to the over-populated Earth, its hospitals, its industrial plants, its streets. These images are very reminiscent of the Johannesburg ghettos depicted in "District 9". And then, you get to see glimpses of the wonderful Elysium, a visual tour-de-force that ends up being shamefully underused in the film. The first moments Max is shown after being exposed to radiation, the film jumps into a nerve-racking tone, and it is very effective, as it is blended with several dramatic elements that range from innovative to pretty common.\n\nUnfortunately, the pace slows down in the second third, where Max's story gets sidelined a bit, to the profit of a few sub-plots that involve an unpredictable, yet not so major twist in terms of impact on the story, as well as a sub-story involving the daughter of an old friend of Max. And while the twist is a welcome addition, the sub-story comes a little out of nowhere and comes off as a bit of a cliché. It seemed like Blomkamp was trying to preserve this family theme that was dear to him in "District 9", and that served the story so well in his previous film. Its unusual aspect prevented it from being too clichéd (an alien dad and his alien son), which is unfortunately not the case in "Elysium". It does not ruin the film, but it does steal its share of precious screen time in a film that feels a tad too short, and leads it towards more conventional developments.\n\nThen the pace picks up again, with a third act that consists mostly of a bunch of pretty awesome action/fighting sequences, where the feeling of urgency from the original quest has pretty much left the building. In terms of writing, this is conventional stuff, but the technical expertise behind the visuals and the sound is a thing of beauty. Also, the dramatic elements displayed in the first third are briefly brought back to seal the deal, and do provide a satisfying feeling of closure to the story.\n\nOverall, this is quality entertainment with impressive visuals, and a world of ideas that had infinite potential. And while "Elysium" exploited only a fraction of its potential, what it did exploit it did it successfully. Directing, photography, music, and performances are all superb. With a decent yet a bit unoriginal social commentary in the background that does get shelved in the second half to the profit of rock-solid action sequences, the strengths of "Elysium", taken individually, do feel a bit scattered, but make for an overall very competent package.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":424635,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.\n\nAnd one final note. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Following the trend on the last years about recycling comic superheroes, Hulk's turn became a very interesting alternative to other formulas used in several of these adaptations.\n\nKnowing that many people consider this movie as dull and boring, please let me state that it's far from being dull. After the critics towards Spiderman just scratching the surface of character development, and where other movies simply failed miserably (e.g. Daredevil), we should be grateful that we can finally see some depth in the main character as we're used in the good comics.\n\nAng Lee's direction shows his usual way of telling stories, in a sensitive and personal way. Instead of letting the movie drown in its limitless action possibilities, he conducted the story through a sensible path. The editing work, which remarkably resembles comic frames in many scenes, and contains some awesome transitions, is simply wonderful.\n\nAnd all this not forgetting Hulk's main point: a green, angry mass of power and destruction. The movie has some of the best action scenes I've seen lately, which makes me wonder what is expecting some people who blame this movie for its lack of massive fights against entire armies. My opinion is that the action scenes of Hulk are perfectly balanced; more than showing Hulk's sheer strength but never going completely overboard. And also showing some of Hulk's main weaknesses, keeping the character real and not entering the area of fantasy.\n\nOne side of this movie that people also seems to throw tantrums about, is the refurbishing of Hulk's origins. The story of Bruce Banner's transformation has been updated with including today's technology, and making it in my humble opinion much more interesting and 'believable' than the original. Not being a huge fan of Hulk's comics, I didn't feel personally attached to the original story, so I actually liked it more. But I can understand that the purists or the die-hard fans will be disappointed by these changes.\n\nAlong with Hulk's origins, the plot includes good science-fiction elements. Don't misunderstand me; the stuff is in general barely believable. A scientist conducting advanced genetic experiments in 1965 (all by himself!) is not a good start... But in the end, it doesn't matter. This superhero adaptation is as good science-fiction as other excellent adaptations like X-Men (including its sequel X2), where others will just remain as good or bad action films with just some sci-fi scattered around. Where others lost their opportunity, Hulk didn't.\n\nWhat other things are good in this movie? Well, the main actors all do a good work, specially Jennifer Conelly and Nick Nolte. The special effects are great, and while there are entire scenes made just of CGI, they're still not the strong point of the movie. The plot and dialogues aren't just bridges between computer generated action scenes, which I'm thankful for. Furthermore, the plot is also rich in references to the comic, Hulk's enemies and other subtle things. The movie is full of small details (has anyone noticed the frog over the hat in the final scene?) which reward you when watching it a second or third time.\n\nThe main down of the movie might be that followers aren't used to see Hulk in this way, a deep and sensitive character, and probably expected more action and enemy-smashing and less deep dialogues running after child traumas... Which could explain its relatively low rating and some bad critics. Maybe I just connected very well with this movie and that's why I put it so well, but I can also see that the elements of this film, taken independently, also have their merits and all together form a solid production. In my opinion, of all the comic superhero adaptations, Hulk is the most interesting and best quality one which I've watched to date. I just wish people would concentrate more on enjoying this different view of a superhero's life. But oh well, each one has different tastes.\n\nAnd one final note. The soundtrack is absolutely wonderful!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254922,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"duration":"PT2H18M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The first Shrek was sweet and innocent, but the second took us to a different edge with terrific animation and just drop on the floor laughable jokes. Antonio Bandares as the cat was just such a great addition to the cast, he just killed me! I don't understand why Shrek 2 wasn't on the top 250, how could someone not enjoy this Shrek? \n\nShrek and Fiona are now married and happy ogres, that is until Fiona's parents wish to see her and her new hubby. Fiona was supposed to marry Prince Charming, which ruined her fairy godmother and dad's plans, so her dad hires a hit-cat to slay Shrek, but fails, but since Shrek spars his life, the cat stays with Donkey and Shrek. Shrek wants so badly for Fiona to live happily ever after, so he and Donkey take a potion from the fairy godmother and have little time to make sure it stays permanent.\n\nLike I said, the Cat was my favorite character, especially when he and Donkey since Livin' La Vida Loca, I thought that it was so cute. Also when he stops the guards in the palace and gives them the cute kitty look. I just don't understand why no one got into the sequel as much as I did, otherwise this would be higher on the rating, and probably above the first Shrek.\n\n10/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":429490,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I thought Shrek 2 was so much better than the first!","reviewBody":"As much as I enjoyed the first Shrek, I honestly almost died laughing and loving Shrek 2. The first Shrek was sweet and innocent, but the second took us to a different edge with terrific animation and just drop on the floor laughable jokes. Antonio Bandares as the cat was just such a great addition to the cast, he just killed me! I don't understand why Shrek 2 wasn't on the top 250, how could someone not enjoy this Shrek? \n\nShrek and Fiona are now married and happy ogres, that is until Fiona's parents wish to see her and her new hubby. Fiona was supposed to marry Prince Charming, which ruined her fairy godmother and dad's plans, so her dad hires a hit-cat to slay Shrek, but fails, but since Shrek spars his life, the cat stays with Donkey and Shrek. Shrek wants so badly for Fiona to live happily ever after, so he and Donkey take a potion from the fairy godmother and have little time to make sure it stays permanent.\n\nLike I said, the Cat was my favorite character, especially when he and Donkey since Livin' La Vida Loca, I thought that it was so cute. Also when he stops the guards in the palace and gives them the cute kitty look. I just don't understand why no one got into the sequel as much as I did, otherwise this would be higher on the rating, and probably above the first Shrek.\n\n10/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":429490,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The first Shrek was sweet and innocent, but the second took us to a different edge with terrific animation and just drop on the floor laughable jokes. Antonio Bandares as the cat was just such a great addition to the cast, he just killed me! I don't understand why Shrek 2 wasn't on the top 250, how could someone not enjoy this Shrek? \n\nShrek and Fiona are now married and happy ogres, that is until Fiona's parents wish to see her and her new hubby. Fiona was supposed to marry Prince Charming, which ruined her fairy godmother and dad's plans, so her dad hires a hit-cat to slay Shrek, but fails, but since Shrek spars his life, the cat stays with Donkey and Shrek. Shrek wants so badly for Fiona to live happily ever after, so he and Donkey take a potion from the fairy godmother and have little time to make sure it stays permanent.\n\nLike I said, the Cat was my favorite character, especially when he and Donkey since Livin' La Vida Loca, I thought that it was so cute.

The first Shrek was sweet and innocent, but the second took us to a different edge with terrific animation and just drop on the floor laughable jokes. Antonio Bandares as the cat was just such a great addition to the cast, he just killed me! I don't understand why Shrek 2 wasn't on the top 250, how could someone not enjoy this Shrek? \n\nShrek and Fiona are now married and happy ogres, that is until Fiona's parents wish to see her and her new hubby. Fiona was supposed to marry Prince Charming, which ruined her fairy godmother and dad's plans, so her dad hires a hit-cat to slay Shrek, but fails, but since Shrek spars his life, the cat stays with Donkey and Shrek. Shrek wants so badly for Fiona to live happily ever after, so he and Donkey take a potion from the fairy godmother and have little time to make sure it stays permanent.\n\nLike I said, the Cat was my favorite character, especially when he and Donkey since Livin' La Vida Loca, I thought that it was so cute. Also when he stops the guards in the palace and gives them the cute kitty look. I just don't understand why no one got into the sequel as much as I did, otherwise this would be higher on the rating, and probably above the first Shrek.\n\n10/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":429490,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, both my wife and I really enjoyed it and my son has been walking around in a bottomless box with holes cut in it,(for his head and arms),for two days.\n\nIt has a lot of charm and a slight edge of darkness. I am surprised that it has received such poor reviews from the critics. I have noticed they tend to rate realistic, depressing films; whereas we like happy escapist fun and this film delivers that. \n\nWe are from the UK and the voices are perhaps better known here, which may have contributed, a little, to our perception of this film's charm.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55124,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But the film in question has totally different setting, providing more realistic views on this issue from both sides - refugees and their hosts.\n\nBeing a wealthy country, the problems Norway has to deal with here are definitely different from the southern EU countries, plus there are also people critical to the state asylum policy. On the other hand, in the event of money provided or received, there is also a scam opportunity... All those and many other versatile issues are wittily dealt through several angles, laugh and rue. The pace is not fully even, 1st half or so is more dynamic than the 2nd, but pleasant performances (particularly Anders Baasmo Christiansen as Primus, Slimane Dazi as Zoran and Olivier Mukuta as Abedi) iron out these small deficiencies.\n\nTrue, for this film, you have to be broad-minded, without strong left or right ideas. Otherwise you may hurt your feelings and/or see the film as a mockery of "high-minded" policies.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1200,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But the film in question has totally different setting, providing more realistic views on this issue from both sides - refugees and their hosts.\n\nBeing a wealthy country, the problems Norway has to deal with here are definitely different from the southern EU countries, plus there are also people critical to the state asylum policy. On the other hand, in the event of money provided or received, there is also a scam opportunity... All those and many other versatile issues are wittily dealt through several angles, laugh and rue. The pace is not fully even, 1st half or so is more dynamic than the 2nd, but pleasant performances (particularly Anders Baasmo Christiansen as Primus, Slimane Dazi as Zoran and Olivier Mukuta as Abedi) iron out these small deficiencies.\n\nTrue, for this film, you have to be broad-minded, without strong left or right ideas. Otherwise you may hurt your feelings and/or see the film as a mockery of "high-minded" policies.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1200,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Its witty screenplay adaptation should have netted Oscar nominations for the great screenwriter I.A.L. Diamond's adaptation, and Ingrid Bergman's flawless performance. It must have been an honor for Goldie Hawn at such a young age to work with Bergman, looking more than a decade younger than her 54 years--fifty four! When she's on the screen, it positively twinkles.\n\nThis is a film which may appear dated at first, but it actually made me wish I was around during the swingin' 'sixties. Hawn's fashions are as tacky as Bergman's are chic. (That's one minor flaw--isn't her character a little too soignée for a gal who still lives with her sister? But then again, would we have Ingrid any other way?) And who wouldn't want to hang out at a nightclub called The Slipped Disc?\n\nThe best compliments I can pay to this film is that it somehow made me nostalgic for a decade that I never saw, and that it left me wanting more. Speaking of wanting more, I wonder what ever became of sexy supporting actor Rick Lenz? (He resembles Griffin Dunne in this film.) This was his film debut, and I don't see any other major roles in his filmography. As for Goldie Hawn, she's done so much since then it's easy to not be impressed, but I can't imagine any other actor in the role, either.\n\nSince the movie is based on a play, the line delivery may seem a bit stage-y, but it did not inhibit my enjoyment at all. In fact, I am amazed at how funny it still is after over thirty-five years. Because this film represents a bygone era, it has unjustly slipped from the consciousness of film buffs. It is more linked to the era films that came before it than the ones that followed. But don't let that stop you from savoring the delights it has to offer.

Well he directed "Police Story" and "Project A" movies like that way back in the 80's and even more recent "Who Am I" in 1998...\n\nAfter that I feel like he's been trying to depend on CGI just too much, I don't really know what to say, it's like the movies he's recently made feel too rushed? Skiptrace, Railroad Tigers, and Kung Fu Yoga ALL FELT LIKE RUSHED HALF ASSED MOVIES...\n\nI don't know what Jackie Chan is thinking... Before around 2010 and below it felt like his movies were perfect, no rush but now since after that it's almost like he's just pumping out movies just for the money and little to no care is gone into them...\n\nJackie you are from the golden age of cinema, DO NOT ADAPT the CGI, I say just go back to how you used to make movies in the 80's and 90's EVEN THOUGH you can't do the stunts you used to be able to do just use doubles when necessary... YOU CAN STILL DO YOUR FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY, there is nothing stopping you from doing that, people just want to see you doing your stuff and you have a lot to offer just in hand to hand choreography anyway that does not require CGI or any doubles!\n\nBut what the hell do I know? We are living in a CGI world now unfortunately...\n\nP.S the only reason I rate this 2 out of 10 is because there were quite a few good fight choreography moments","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9347,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Well he directed "Police Story" and "Project A" movies like that way back in the 80's and even more recent "Who Am I" in 1998...\n\nAfter that I feel like he's been trying to depend on CGI just too much, I don't really know what to say, it's like the movies he's recently made feel too rushed? Skiptrace, Railroad Tigers, and Kung Fu Yoga ALL FELT LIKE RUSHED HALF ASSED MOVIES...\n\nI don't know what Jackie Chan is thinking... Before around 2010 and below it felt like his movies were perfect, no rush but now since after that it's almost like he's just pumping out movies just for the money and little to no care is gone into them...\n\nJackie you are from the golden age of cinema, DO NOT ADAPT the CGI, I say just go back to how you used to make movies in the 80's and 90's EVEN THOUGH you can't do the stunts you used to be able to do just use doubles when necessary... YOU CAN STILL DO YOUR FIGHT CHOREOGRAPHY, there is nothing stopping you from doing that, people just want to see you doing your stuff and you have a lot to offer just in hand to hand choreography anyway that does not require CGI or any doubles!\n\nBut what the hell do I know? We are living in a CGI world now unfortunately...\n\nP.S the only reason I rate this 2 out of 10 is because there were quite a few good fight choreography moments","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9347,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Despite being warned very strongly against going to see this film and despite the trailer looking unappetising, I still saw it anyway. It was always going to be a film that would go either way, the amount of talent on board, my general love for family films and for Postman Pat could have suggested that the film would be fun and charming, but there was the worry also that it would look as muddled, target-audience-confused and hasty-looking as the trailer suggested. The film has its moments and it is not from personal opinion quite as bad as heard, but it was a big disappointment. The film begins very promisingly with a very idyllic opening that was the closest the film ever got in resembling the show, the Big Time song is a great upbeat song that has some very funny visual gags, the montage where Pat meets his wife for the first time was very touching and the "Faster Pussy-Bot, Kill Kill!" seemed like a Daleks reference and it was if the case a clever one at that. The soundtrack is catchy and bring energy to the film and the voice cast are good and very enthusiastic, David Tennant sounds like he's having a whale of a time but Steven Mangan, who's very sympathetic and dead-on as Pat, and Jim Broadbent acquit themselves very well too.\n\nSadly, Postman Pat: The Movie is let down by that it didn't seem to know what to do with itself or know who to aim the film at. The story is rather over-complicated and confused focusing mainly on the talent show subplot and also including a Dr Who-like robot invasion/world domination one, neither of which show any originality, cleverness or charm. The satire for the former is nowhere near sharp enough, the humour actually felt to me rather forced mostly throughout the film and borders on vulgar while the latter felt thrown in and like it belonged in another film altogether, is not all that cleverly or thrillingly done and may contain bits that the younger audience may find scary or upsetting. The script would have benefited from a far more simpler approach and less going on and while it is admirable that the film did clearly think of the adult audience I think it could have done a better job at having more for the youngsters. Some of the jokes will go over their heads, unless they were introduced to Dr Who at a very young age, and if they are familiar with the whimsy and warmth that the show had the film sadly is a far cry from that.

Despite being warned very strongly against going to see this film and despite the trailer looking unappetising, I still saw it anyway. It was always going to be a film that would go either way, the amount of talent on board, my general love for family films and for Postman Pat could have suggested that the film would be fun and charming, but there was the worry also that it would look as muddled, target-audience-confused and hasty-looking as the trailer suggested. The film has its moments and it is not from personal opinion quite as bad as heard, but it was a big disappointment. The film begins very promisingly with a very idyllic opening that was the closest the film ever got in resembling the show, the Big Time song is a great upbeat song that has some very funny visual gags, the montage where Pat meets his wife for the first time was very touching and the "Faster Pussy-Bot, Kill Kill!" seemed like a Daleks reference and it was if the case a clever one at that. The soundtrack is catchy and bring energy to the film and the voice cast are good and very enthusiastic, David Tennant sounds like he's having a whale of a time but Steven Mangan, who's very sympathetic and dead-on as Pat, and Jim Broadbent acquit themselves very well too.\n\nSadly, Postman Pat: The Movie is let down by that it didn't seem to know what to do with itself or know who to aim the film at. The story is rather over-complicated and confused focusing mainly on the talent show subplot and also including a Dr Who-like robot invasion/world domination one, neither of which show any originality, cleverness or charm. The satire for the former is nowhere near sharp enough, the humour actually felt to me rather forced mostly throughout the film and borders on vulgar while the latter felt thrown in and like it belonged in another film altogether, is not all that cleverly or thrillingly done and may contain bits that the younger audience may find scary or upsetting. The script would have benefited from a far more simpler approach and less going on and while it is admirable that the film did clearly think of the adult audience I think it could have done a better job at having more for the youngsters. Some of the jokes will go over their heads, unless they were introduced to Dr Who at a very young age, and if they are familiar with the whimsy and warmth that the show had the film sadly is a far cry from that. The characters are bland, the exceptions being Pat who is very likable and possibly Jess as well but the others lacked personality. The film was unevenly paced with some of the earlier parts in need of more zip and some of the later parts in need of a slow-down, most apparent in a climax that was action-packed but too busy and dark compared to the rest of the film. The soundtrack is one of the best things about Postman Pat: The Movie and Ronan Keating does a great job as Pat's singing voice but it is a case of the singing voice not matching the speaking voice especially in the tone. Just as disappointing as the writing was the animation, the opening was really promising but the rest looked like it was made in a lot of haste and had some very over-saturated and too bright colours, the characters also lack expression and on occasions look creepy, Pat is the one exception. Overall, a disappointing feature film debut of a much cherished classic character, not an awful film and has some good assets but it felt over-stuffed, muddled and bland with some cheap direct-to-video-like visuals with the opening being the only time where it bared any resemblance to the show. 4/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1629,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.\n\nStory: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her "resurrection" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.\n\nActing: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.\n\nAction: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.\n\nCinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.\n\nDirection: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.\n\nOverall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5\n\nP.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":375498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The cast was great once again with Paul Walker returning to his role as Brian O'Connor and Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendes adding new character dynamics. Tyrese in particular was great. If there's one thing the first film lacked it's that there wasn't much humor. It was a very serious film and while that's great, Tyrese's character, Roman Pearce, added some great laughs at some unexpected moments. The cinematic effects were much better in this film also. The only negatives were that some of the action sequences were a little overboard (Dukes of Hazard jump for example) and the dialogue had too much street car jargon to the extent that some of it felt forced. "That Yenko will snap a speedo in 5 seconds" is an example of the type of dialogue that doesn't actually feel genuine in its placement in the film. Nonetheless, a really good movie with solid acting and great action.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The cast was great once again with Paul Walker returning to his role as Brian O'Connor and Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendes adding new character dynamics. Tyrese in particular was great. If there's one thing the first film lacked it's that there wasn't much humor. It was a very serious film and while that's great, Tyrese's character, Roman Pearce, added some great laughs at some unexpected moments. The cinematic effects were much better in this film also. The only negatives were that some of the action sequences were a little overboard (Dukes of Hazard jump for example) and the dialogue had too much street car jargon to the extent that some of it felt forced. "That Yenko will snap a speedo in 5 seconds" is an example of the type of dialogue that doesn't actually feel genuine in its placement in the film. Nonetheless, a really good movie with solid acting and great action.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.\n\nStory: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her "resurrection" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.\n\nActing: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.\n\nAction: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.\n\nCinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.\n\nDirection: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.\n\nOverall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5\n\nP.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":375498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.\n\nStory: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her "resurrection" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.\n\nActing: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie.

I hated and I loved this turn of the franchise, I hated it because in part 5, the racing competition aspect of the film is gone, it became chases but I also loved this turn because it made the franchise take a different approach. My question is, will this formula still work with part 6? Find out below.\n\nStory: The story in this movie picks up after the previous one where it was known that 'Letty' (Michelle Rodriguez) was still alive and I admit that they handled her "resurrection" quite well but that is only the sub-plot of this movie. The main plot is Hobbs (The Rock) is chasing after Owen Shaw (Luke Evans). He then gets the help of Toretto and Brian's crew by using Letty as bait (or that's how I see it). The story is pretty simple and they told it without adding anymore sub plot but some of the sub plots that were made felt very crowded to the story even though it was solved. It just felt a little heavy and a bit too much for the movie.\n\nActing: If you saw the previous installments from this franchise well then you ain't missing anything from their performance, it's pretty much the same but I have to say this though, Vin Diesel and The Rock displays pure bad-assery in this movie. That being said, I will give my two cents on the two characters from this movie which are Gina Carano who played Riley and Luke Evans who is Owen Shaw. Carano was able to hold her own despite having little dialogue and what makes her character seems badass is because of her action scene, this is actually one of the things I'm looking forward to upon seeing this movie because I loved her in 'Haywire' (awesome film, check it out) and I;m confident to say that I am not disappointed with her on this one. Next is Luke Evans, he IMO is one the versatile actors in the industry today, you can cast him in almost any role and he displays a good performance. In here is the main villain although he gave a good performance in this role I find it hard to find him as an effective villain, there is something missing with his performance here I'm just not sure what it is.\n\nAction: The Fast franchise is definitely known for having one of the best car chases ever and this one doesn't disappoint and it does not only have car chases but also fist fights, head bangin' and other sh*t. Even though some of the action scene were very over the top it was still entertaining and was handled pretty well. The action was not violent or brutal as it showed little to no blood and being a fan of R-13 I can say that this rating does not fit well to the style of FF and I'm happy and contented with it's PG-13 rating. IMO this is the most action-packed FF film so far.\n\nCinematography: The cinematographer did a wonderful job here, the shots were just amazing and adds depth to the mood that is set within each scene. The shots were able to show scenery that really captures the beauty of the set and like I said the mood of the scene.\n\nDirection: I wasn't much of a fan of Lin's direction here, it was pretty slow which made the film a little boring for me despite having heavy action. Even though the movie is a little slow paced, Lin was able to tell the story with it's whole heart. I liked how he did the pacing in FF 5 though.\n\nOverall: 'Fast and Furious 6' was high-octane action movie injected with some humor. Using the same formula as the previous one made this film good and also bringing back the racing aspect of the original FF films. While I consider the FF 5 is still the best one in the franchise, I can still say that this is one solid addition to it. I give this movie a 3.5/5\n\nP.S. Watch the post-credit scene, it made me get hyped for Fast and Furious 7.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":375498,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT2H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively.

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Dallas. The Young and the Restless.  The Dukes of Hazzard.  He-Man.  The Greatest American Hero.  Airwolf.  Knight Rider.\n\nIn 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they did not commit.  They promptly escaped a maximum security stockade into the Los Angeles Underground.  Today, still wanted by the government, they exist as soldiers of fortune.  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...\n\nThe A-Team.\n\nWith a script any eight year old would love, the four members of the A-Team went off every week to somewhere in America to help someone who couldn't find help anywhere else.  They battled impossible odds (with impossible storylines) and managed to stay one step ahead of the law.  They were always predictable, heroic, and fun.

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively.

He's a surgeon from sophisticated, worldly London who moves to (fictional) Portwenn on the coast of Cornwall because he suddenly becomes ill at the sight of blood. This is not a good omen for a surgeon. He quits to become a general practitioner and he's satisfied, thanks very much, with checkups, prescriptions and referrals.\n\nThe foul-mannered, blunt-spoken Doc smugly considers himself above the crowd, but he soon learns he is really BELOW the crowd, out of step with Portwenn's eccentricities, value systems and peculiar burghers, who make the mere lunatics of London look normal by comparison.\n\nMartin Clunes is terrific in the lead role. He is a tall, charismatic and not exactly handsome actor who looks like he would be more comfortable playing cops and heavies. He is, instead, a consummate comic actor. His facial and physical comedy, his frequent bouts of exasperation and bewilderment, are things to behold. (Note: some wags have compared him to 'House,' from the popular TV drama of the same name. House is played by Hugh Laurie, another splendid Brit, and that's about where the comparison begins and ends. They are two very different characters in two very different shows.)\n\nPortwenn's local population, with its twisted logic that somehow makes perfect sense, is represented through the tour-de-force acting of supporting players: Bert (Ian McNeice, who always dazzles playing offbeat, world-weary philosophical characters); Louise (the charming and beautiful Caroline Catz), who either loves Martin or wants to kill him; corn-rowed Elaine (lovely Lucy Punch) as the ditzy assistant with her own set of secretarial ethics; and Doc's Aunt Joan (the great Stephanie Cole, who has been delighting audiences since the 1960s).\n\nDominic Minghella, he of the Minghella mob of talented artists (brother Anthony directed 'The English Patient'), is the brains behind this brilliant controlled chaos.\n\nDon't miss this program. TV shows that are both funny AND intelligent are the rarest of TV fare.\n\nAnd a fast footnote: let us all bow our heads and pray that Hollywood doesn't try to remake this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Dallas. The Young and the Restless.  The Dukes of Hazzard.  He-Man.  The Greatest American Hero.  Airwolf.  Knight Rider.\n\nIn 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they did not commit.  They promptly escaped a maximum security stockade into the Los Angeles Underground.  Today, still wanted by the government, they exist as soldiers of fortune.  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...\n\nThe A-Team.\n\nWith a script any eight year old would love, the four members of the A-Team went off every week to somewhere in America to help someone who couldn't find help anywhere else.  They battled impossible odds (with impossible storylines) and managed to stay one step ahead of the law.  They were always predictable, heroic, and fun.  God bless the eighties, and long live TV Land.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35564,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"1983-01-23","keywords":"gmc vandura,cult tv,good versus evil,mercenary,hero for hire","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000577/","name":"George Peppard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001558/","name":"Mr. T","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776239/","name":"Dwight Schultz"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004798/","name":"Stephen J.

That is not to say it is a bad achievement, for the end product is fun, exhilarating and stylish. I do however feel it is extremely important to debunk the 'comic book' label since it is both unjustly applied and it will perhaps generate false expectations from the mainstream audience.\n\nAlthough The Punisher is adapted from Marvel Comics, the R-rating alone should be blunt indicator of the path it intends to take. Half an hour into the film it still leaves us clueless and oblivious to the dark turn it will twist into. During which Thomas Jane undergoes an apt transformation of character from heartfelt family man on that one last undercover op to a hard-boiled, brooding vigilante who downs whiskey, swears, tortures and broods. The catalyst for this development is the brutal murder of his family and now he's out to get the hierarchy of villains (headed by John Travolta)  only he isn't just out for vengeance or justice  he's out to punish. In a corrupt city of thugs, Frank Castle becomes the judge, jury and executor.\n\nWhat is so refreshing about Thomas Jane in the part of Punisher is that he is a sprawling surge of old school with a splash of Clint Eastwood protagonist  the detached, effortless action hero who is too cool for romantic interests, with hardcore one-liners and a merciless approach to duels. In this way, he is easily one of the most successful 'superhero' actors of the new millennium. But alas, Jane went unnoticed and Punisher did poorly at the box office probably BECAUSE it adopted this off-beat, old-school style to acting and action.\n\nI also want to comment on said action, which was spectacular. Truth to be told, I have been waiting a long time to say that about a film. Usually it's the obligatory "the visuals are stunning" or "it's extremely fast-paced and kinetic" but here the sheer hand-to-hand combat is the film's goldmine because it moves back into close character mode instead of the epic scenarios that Batman, Superman and Spiderman dish out to keep out interest. It's gloriously gritty, graphic and dirty which unfortunately also begs the question of where the $33,000,000 budget went.

That is not to say it is a bad achievement, for the end product is fun, exhilarating and stylish. I do however feel it is extremely important to debunk the 'comic book' label since it is both unjustly applied and it will perhaps generate false expectations from the mainstream audience.\n\nAlthough The Punisher is adapted from Marvel Comics, the R-rating alone should be blunt indicator of the path it intends to take. Half an hour into the film it still leaves us clueless and oblivious to the dark turn it will twist into. During which Thomas Jane undergoes an apt transformation of character from heartfelt family man on that one last undercover op to a hard-boiled, brooding vigilante who downs whiskey, swears, tortures and broods. The catalyst for this development is the brutal murder of his family and now he's out to get the hierarchy of villains (headed by John Travolta)  only he isn't just out for vengeance or justice  he's out to punish. In a corrupt city of thugs, Frank Castle becomes the judge, jury and executor.\n\nWhat is so refreshing about Thomas Jane in the part of Punisher is that he is a sprawling surge of old school with a splash of Clint Eastwood protagonist  the detached, effortless action hero who is too cool for romantic interests, with hardcore one-liners and a merciless approach to duels. In this way, he is easily one of the most successful 'superhero' actors of the new millennium. But alas, Jane went unnoticed and Punisher did poorly at the box office probably BECAUSE it adopted this off-beat, old-school style to acting and action.\n\nI also want to comment on said action, which was spectacular. Truth to be told, I have been waiting a long time to say that about a film. Usually it's the obligatory "the visuals are stunning" or "it's extremely fast-paced and kinetic" but here the sheer hand-to-hand combat is the film's goldmine because it moves back into close character mode instead of the epic scenarios that Batman, Superman and Spiderman dish out to keep out interest. It's gloriously gritty, graphic and dirty which unfortunately also begs the question of where the $33,000,000 budget went. Did they spend it all on late night taco runs?\n\nFor that matter, The Punisher is far from devoid of faults. Its fatal flaw stems, in part, from what made it a good film in the first place: its sparseness of effects, general minimalism and lack of superhero formula. Rather it is a model-kit assembled from seedy old-school revenge action movies, the type you'd sort of casually catch a bit of on TV one night. \n\n7 out of 10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":151841,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
