Many may say that this is a 'rip-off' of CSI but I've watched CSI and it caught me on for a bit, but after a while it just seemed to closed. Where CSI guides you through the story and gives a picture perfect ending and how you're supposed to perceive it, Criminal Minds lets you explore and judge for yourself. It doesn't preach too much and the stories are engaging and suspenseful! Excellent writing and great performances from the stars. It may begin cliché, but if you stay long enough it is a rewarding and entertaining view, and I don't feel it's going to let down any time soon. Give it a chance, or just watch episode 7 'The Fox'. It shows the best writing and acting in the show so far, in my opinion. Diving into minds of lunatics and psychopaths has never been more entertaining!

Many may say that this is a 'rip-off' of CSI but I've watched CSI and it caught me on for a bit, but after a while it just seemed to closed. Where CSI guides you through the story and gives a picture perfect ending and how you're supposed to perceive it, Criminal Minds lets you explore and judge for yourself. It doesn't preach too much and the stories are engaging and suspenseful! Excellent writing and great performances from the stars. It may begin cliché, but if you stay long enough it is a rewarding and entertaining view, and I don't feel it's going to let down any time soon. Give it a chance, or just watch episode 7 'The Fox'. It shows the best writing and acting in the show so far, in my opinion. Diving into minds of lunatics and psychopaths has never been more entertaining!

And he will do it ,even though it will be short-lived.(an admirable scene)\n\nUnfortunately , when you've got no child, you 're not "normal ": the quarrel during the grand-parents' golden wedding is revealing ,and François 's humiliation knows no bound .\n\nEllipsis is a common procedure in film narrative ,but here it's brilliantly used: ; after they've seen François rock the baby in his arms , there's no scene between the four protagonists of the affair ; Noémie ,the cheated wife ,waits to be home .\n\nRecommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-07","keywords":"paternity,wood,sawmill,husband wife relationship,infidelity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2478489881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NWQzNjEtYzkwZS00NTAyLWJmNjItZTczYTJiMGRkNjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NWQzNjEtYzkwZS00NTAyLWJmNjItZTczYTJiMGRkNjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504267/","name":"Jalil Lespert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2864046/","name":"Louise Bourgoin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235461/","name":"Mélanie Doutey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292833/","name":"Raphaël Jacoulot"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011118/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6940903/","name":"Benjamin Adam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8166889/","name":"Fadette Drouard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292833/","name":"Raphaël Jacoulot"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Kopylov makes the battles feel grounded and realistic for the most part, and some soldiers suffer shell shock, PTSD, delirium and panic attacks, just as you would expect under those conditions. The violence is also fairly visceral and realistic; the special effects team make use of both squibbing and CGI, so while those of you who may hate the look of CGI blood, there is still some squibbing effects that help highlight the realism of the gun battles.\n\nOverall, it's a fascinating watch. Of course it's not as over-the-top and action-packed as T-34, but it is very similar to Kim Druzhinin and Andrey Shalopa's tightly hewn war-thriller, Panfilov's 28.

This is a decent movie to say the least - and it is based on real events. So there is that for sure.

Pas du tout ! Because soon Patricia is pregnant by her lover : although François is elated (my own flash and blood) , the lovers are out on a limb:shall they divorce ?\n\nThis is good psychological drama , filmed on location in the grandiose landscapes of the Jura Mountains (the cinematography is splendid indeed) , well acted and off the beaten track . The social context , the sawmill François and his wife run, which runs into difficulties (although it's not mentioned in the film , importations of wood from North Europa cause problems )is carefully depicted and one feels husband's and wife's love for their work and for the raw material ,wood: François tells the woman from the adoption agency he would take his foster child to the forest and make him share his passion (but it does not convince the lady). And he will do it ,even though it will be short-lived.(an admirable scene)\n\nUnfortunately , when you've got no child, you 're not "normal ": the quarrel during the grand-parents' golden wedding is revealing ,and François 's humiliation knows no bound .\n\nEllipsis is a common procedure in film narrative ,but here it's brilliantly used: ; after they've seen François rock the baby in his arms , there's no scene between the four protagonists of the affair ; Noémie ,the cheated wife ,waits to be home .\n\nRecommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-07","keywords":"paternity,wood,sawmill,husband wife relationship,infidelity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2478489881","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NWQzNjEtYzkwZS00NTAyLWJmNjItZTczYTJiMGRkNjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NWQzNjEtYzkwZS00NTAyLWJmNjItZTczYTJiMGRkNjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504267/","name":"Jalil Lespert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2864046/","name":"Louise Bourgoin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235461/","name":"Mélanie Doutey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292833/","name":"Raphaël Jacoulot"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011118/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346444/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6940903/","name":"Benjamin Adam"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8166889/","name":"Fadette Drouard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292833/","name":"Raphaël Jacoulot"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Pas du tout ! Because soon Patricia is pregnant by her lover : although François is elated (my own flash and blood) , the lovers are out on a limb:shall they divorce ?\n\nThis is good psychological drama , filmed on location in the grandiose landscapes of the Jura Mountains (the cinematography is splendid indeed) , well acted and off the beaten track . The social context , the sawmill François and his wife run, which runs into difficulties (although it's not mentioned in the film , importations of wood from North Europa cause problems )is carefully depicted and one feels husband's and wife's love for their work and for the raw material ,wood: François tells the woman from the adoption agency he would take his foster child to the forest and make him share his passion (but it does not convince the lady). And he will do it ,even though it will be short-lived.(an admirable scene)\n\nUnfortunately , when you've got no child, you 're not "normal ": the quarrel during the grand-parents' golden wedding is revealing ,and François 's humiliation knows no bound .\n\nEllipsis is a common procedure in film narrative ,but here it's brilliantly used: ; after they've seen François rock the baby in his arms , there's no scene between the four protagonists of the affair ; Noémie ,the cheated wife ,waits to be home .\n\nRecommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-07","keywords":"paternity,wood,sawmill,husband wife relationship,infidelity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2478489881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NWQzNjEtYzkwZS00NTAyLWJmNjItZTczYTJiMGRkNjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzA5NWQzNjEtYzkwZS00NTAyLWJmNjItZTczYTJiMGRkNjBhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504267/","name":"Jalil Lespert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2864046/","name":"Louise Bourgoin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0235461/","name":"Mélanie Doutey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292833/","name":"Raphaël Jacoulot"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011118/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346444/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6940903/","name":"Benjamin Adam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8166889/","name":"Fadette Drouard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1292833/","name":"Raphaël Jacoulot"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The film itself is just a small look at the many lives lost trying to capture and secure this small village.\n\nThe film does a fine job of not shying away from the brutal and sadistic nature of the Germans to secure victory (massacring and raping civilians) and then systematically wiping out opposing forces.\n\nThe film also does a fine job of making it known that some of the biggest hurdles the Russian army faced in the war was from Soviet leadership!\n\nThe bureaucracy and stupidity of the Soviets cost many great and brave men their lives.

Kopylov makes the battles feel grounded and realistic for the most part, and some soldiers suffer shell shock, PTSD, delirium and panic attacks, just as you would expect under those conditions. The violence is also fairly visceral and realistic; the special effects team make use of both squibbing and CGI, so while those of you who may hate the look of CGI blood, there is still some squibbing effects that help highlight the realism of the gun battles.\n\nOverall, it's a fascinating watch. Of course it's not as over-the-top and action-packed as T-34, but it is very similar to Kim Druzhinin and Andrey Shalopa's tightly hewn war-thriller, Panfilov's 28.

"The Defeated", the show's original title, might have been better. But neither really captures the show that well. Set in post-war Germany shortly after their defeat, the show's early episodes seem to do a decent job of capturing the misery, desperation, and the broken remains of a country and its people who not only lost the war, but had their civilization bombed into submission.\n\nAnd perhaps that's why a story of a NYPD cop trying to help rebuild and reestablish law and order sounded like a good premise. But that epic-worthy premise gets weighed down by a search for a brother who's gone AWOL, run-ins with Russian military (which is okay if they weren't made into villains), and multitudes of minor story branches that just seem to drag the story into smaller issues that muddle the show and makes the story feel small. What gets lost is the bigger picture, of what is transpiring at the historical level during this time period. This is no Babylon Berlin, which in my opinion, is a masterpiece.\n\nAnd what's up with the Brooklyn accent? Kitsch does a passable job, but the show can't seem to make up its mind on whether he's a scrappy street cop or a polished NY police brass savvy in the ways of bureaucracy and politics. I suppose it's part of his backstory, but to me, it feels unnecessary, just like all the f-bombs casually thrown in.\n\nDespite all its shortcomings, the show is beautifully shot, the acting is mostly good (mostly the Germans), and there is a main story that makes its way through, I think.

Eté 85 is a mixture of Ozon and a try to mimic Almadóvar's way of looking into tragedy, which unfortunately fails completely. The scenes are great, the actors true to their characters, but what comes out is a story swaying between a kitsch gay teenagers' love affair and a family drama. The ending is weird (I am referring to the court sentence), taking into account the fact that the subject of homosexuality was at the time socially unacceptable was extremely poorly part of the story to that point, with the exception of a vague reference to an uncle). None of the three main characters (Alexis, David and the mother, Mme Gorman) develop and their reactions throughout the film are irrational, somewhere between funny and stupid, in a combination which simply does not work. Kate's acting is miserable, same as Alexis' parents. The only convincing character, if any, is probably the social worker.\n\nConcluding, this is a mediocre film to watch if you are into gay dramas and have nothing better to do.

"The Defeated", the show's original title, might have been better. But neither really captures the show that well. Set in post-war Germany shortly after their defeat, the show's early episodes seem to do a decent job of capturing the misery, desperation, and the broken remains of a country and its people who not only lost the war, but had their civilization bombed into submission.\n\nAnd perhaps that's why a story of a NYPD cop trying to help rebuild and reestablish law and order sounded like a good premise. But that epic-worthy premise gets weighed down by a search for a brother who's gone AWOL, run-ins with Russian military (which is okay if they weren't made into villains), and multitudes of minor story branches that just seem to drag the story into smaller issues that muddle the show and makes the story feel small. What gets lost is the bigger picture, of what is transpiring at the historical level during this time period. This is no Babylon Berlin, which in my opinion, is a masterpiece.\n\nAnd what's up with the Brooklyn accent? Kitsch does a passable job, but the show can't seem to make up its mind on whether he's a scrappy street cop or a polished NY police brass savvy in the ways of bureaucracy and politics. I suppose it's part of his backstory, but to me, it feels unnecessary, just like all the f-bombs casually thrown in.\n\nDespite all its shortcomings, the show is beautifully shot, the acting is mostly good (mostly the Germans), and there is a main story that makes its way through, I think. It's not entirely a waste of time to watch--if you have the time, that is.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2295,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-10-30","keywords":"police protagonist,american cop abroad,american in germany,post war germany,world war two","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2018237/","name":"Taylor Kitsch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355910/","name":"Michael C.

But that epic-worthy premise gets weighed down by a search for a brother who's gone AWOL, run-ins with Russian military (which is okay if they weren't made into villains), and multitudes of minor story branches that just seem to drag the story into smaller issues that muddle the show and makes the story feel small.

It gives good insight in the daily problems that young Africans like Bandian face and the culture they grow up in. I myself think it's horrible to see that his parents, with the help of some medicine man, decide what Bandian should do and shouldn't do with his life. But it's also a film of joy and hope.

It gives good insight in the daily problems that young Africans like Bandian face and the culture they grow up in. I myself think it's horrible to see that his parents, with the help of some medicine man, decide what Bandian should do and shouldn't do with his life. But it's also a film of joy and hope. Bandian meets new friends on the way and learns about trust and forgiveness. The film paints great pictures of the African landscape. By the way, if you're a soccer fan, you'll probably like the action scenes of Bandian performing magic on the ball.

I want to start off with the Pilot. When I first saw it, I had a lot of problems with it. It was messy, and some of the characters were dumb, and some of the acting was corny. However, after the Pilot ended, I realized just how intrigued I was by it. It sure was a messy Pilot, but that's the beauty of it. It was always moving, it wasn't your typical slow-paced suspense show. \n\nIn fact, that pretty much sums up the whole season. This is a crackling, fast-paced and entertaining horror series. I would never call this high- art, but that's what makes it great. The show doesn't take itself seriously at all, and it always remains fun, even when it's silly, and yet you get really invested in the story lines and characters. Sure, the performances are flawed at times, and the writing and directing awkward, but the fast pace in every episode doesn't ever let the viewer gasp for air. This is the true definition of a thrill ride. It also feels very experimental. It executes a lot of things in very unordinary ways, in ways that no other TV show does. It doesn't always succeed, but even when it doesn't, you can appreciate it. \n\nYour friends might call The Walking Dead the better horror show, but I disagree. As far as Pilots go, no matter how entertaining or thrilling American Horror Story's Pilot was, the Pilot for The Walking Dead was better, masterful in every way. Since then, it's merely a good, sometimes great, TV show. It takes itself more seriously and is slower-paced, but it's problem is that a lot of times the writing just feels stale, recycled. You are intrigued by it, but it sometimes feels weaker than it should be. And the fact that it takes itself too seriously sort of dampens the fun one should be having with it, simply because its writing isn't strong enough to stretch out its story lines (like the two best TV shows on air, Mad Men and Breaking Bad, do). American Horror Story is better for these reasons- each episode by itself is exciting, it's always moving, and instead of trying to slow things down and makes its flaws more apparent, it even overdoes things on purpose. Messy, sure, silly, sometimes, but overall more intriguing, funner, and more exciting. I cannot wait for the second season of this, since I thought the resolution to the story of the first season was excellent, as well as the final shot. \n\nP.S. Oh, I also want to add another note to take. The performances do hit their great marks, but the only truly incredible performance is Jessica Lange. Her character and performance makes all other supporting turns in television look stale by comparison, and all of her scenes are truly gold! She needs to win that Emmy next year!

Res ipsa loquitur - she simply could not have died from a fall down the stairs given the lacerations and the blood. And nothing to suggest that an intruder caused her death. Sure, I winced when Freda Black went on and on about the porn, as if its existence on Peterson's computer in and of itself indicates anything. But all in all it was an interesting lesson into how the skilled storyteller can skew anything towards his chosen bias. And the score was absolutely exquisite.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20484,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary","Crime","Drama"],"keywords":"columnist,blowpoke,true crime,blood,staircase","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2023399/","name":"Michael Peterson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5308683/","name":"David Rudolf","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5509614/","name":"Ron Guerette"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Staircase - Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2745482009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJlZTMyYTktYjA0Mi00ODRiLThkMzQtMmNkM2JmNjI0OTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJlZTMyYTktYjA0Mi00ODRiLThkMzQtMmNkM2JmNjI0OTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"The compelling story of Michael Peterson, a crime novelist accused of killing wife Kathleen after she is found dead at the bottom of a staircase in their home."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A forgotten classic that on second viewing still has the same impact when we saw it at a retrospective of the master's work some time back. Fellini was instrumental in creating this magnificent movie about con men that operated in Italy in the years that followed the end of WWII. Fellini worked on the screen play with his collaborators, Tullio Pinelli and Ennio Flaiano; they gave life to all these swindlers and made them human. Nino Rota's music and Otello Martinelli's cinematography compliment the film and make it even better.\n\nFellini was a director that got a lot from his actors, as he shows in "Il Bidone". Working with Broderick Crawford, and again with Richard Basehart, he was able to have both men give excellent performances, especially Mr. Crawford, who looks as though he is nothing but Italian because he convinces us he is the hard man he is portraying.\n\nThe three friends, Augusto, Picasso, and Roberto, go from one scheme to the next, never thinking about who are they stealing from. The best caper occurs at the beginning of the film as the trio arrives at the farm of the two older women with the promise of riches hidden in their land. Mr. Crawford's bishop is perfect. So is the assistant priest of Richard Basehart. Franco Fabrizi is the driver. The solution for getting the money away from the poor women is something not to be believed.\n\nAugusto's life is an empty one. He goes from one job to another trying to outsmart his victims. It's not until Augusto meets his daughter Patrizia by chance, that he begins to feel what might be some remorse for his actions as he notices his beautiful daughter now grown and on her way to making something out of her life. His conscience begins to bother him because he realizes the evil of his ways.\n\nThe other best sequence in the film involves the party at Vargas' house where the swindlers have been invited to celebrate the arrival of the new year. We watch as Iris, Picasso's wife, realizes what her husband and the others are really up to. Roberto, the ladies' man, steals the gold cigarette case, not realizing that he is at the home of another con man and his actions will not go unnoticed, but even the embarrassment he goes through in front of the guests will make him give up his life.\n\n"Il Bidone" is a fine example of the Italian cinema of those years as it shows an artist of the caliber of Federico Fellini in top form. The film will delight people that haven't been exposed to that part of Mr. Fellini's career seldom seen these days.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1955-10-07","keywords":"italy,con man,peasant,new year's eve,nightclub","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002024/","name":"Broderick Crawford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000865/","name":"Richard Basehart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0556399/","name":"Giulietta Masina"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000019/","name":"Federico Fellini"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032224/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005342/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000019/","name":"Federico Fellini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0280919/","name":"Ennio Flaiano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0684083/","name":"Tullio Pinelli"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He's nowadays as sheriff , Marshal Chris Adams , who turns down a friend's request to help stop the depredations of a band of Mexican bandits , but then his spouse (Mariette Hartley) has been kidnapped by a gang . When his wife is abducted by bank thieves and his friend is murdered capturing the last outlaw , Chris feels obligated to take up his partner's cause . Then Chris along with a journalist (Michael Callan) set off in pursuit bandit gunfighters (Gary Busey among them) , as he recruits five prisoners to track down the desperadoes . Besides , Chris helping his buddy (Ralph Waite) must free a Mexican village (inhabited by women as Stefanie Powers , among others) besieged by nasty outlaws who are devastating the small location . Lee van Cleef is decided to take a group of prisoners and strike a blow against the Mexican bandits . He goes to Tucson Territorial Prison where a bunch of misfits , murderers , robbers , rapists and other prisoners (with a TV star-studded cast such as Pedro Armendariz , Luke Askew, William Lucking, Ed Lauter, and James B. Sikking ) get a chance to redeem themselves . As Chris recruits various Magnificent Men and once again defending hapless people from their oppressors . As a brand of new seven , doing their number , they put their lives on the line and let it ride . \n\nThe last in the original series of four ¨The Magnificent Seven¨ movies , here Lee Van Cleef as Chris , substituting Yul Brynner , who played the role in two occasions , and one performed by George Kennedy . Yul Brynner insisted he would only make the sequels if Steve McQueen was not involved , McQueen felt the plot was too absurd and for this, and other reasons, was not interested anyway . Van Cleef as a two-fisted avenger sheriff is good as well as his role of ¨Sabata¨, meanwhile Yul Brynner left the Chris character for playing the ¨Cleef's Sabata¨ role in ¨Indio Black¨ . The story is similar to previous entries , adding ¨Dirty dozen¨ wake , including customary outlaw band formed by an eclectic gang with diverse speciality , as dynamite or guns . The film gets action Western , exciting riding, shootouts, it's funny and entertaining , although nothing new but displays a television style . The movie contains some moment of grisly violence and even touching on the relationships between the women and the Magnificent . This is a drab , inferior sequel from the original and enduringly popular ¨The magnificent seven¨ (John Sturges,1960) that is equally remake to ¨The seven samurais¨ (in fact , it was Yul Brynner who approached producer Walter Mirisch with the idea of doing a Western adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's classic) . After that , followed ¨The return of the seven¨(Burt Kennedy,1966), again with Brynner and ¨Guns of the magnificent seven¨ (Paul Wendkos,1969) with George Kennedy and continued with a TV series and a Television movie realized in 1998 . As always , breathtaking and memorable musical score by the great Elmer Berstein. Elmer , whose score for the series is one of the best-known ever composed , also wrote the soundtrack for the parody of this film, 'Three amigos'. Appropriate cinematography by expert cameraman Fred J. Koenekamp (Patton, The inferno towering, Papillon) . The motion picture was regularly directed by George McCowan , a usual TV episodes director (Charlie's Angels , Banacek , Cannon , Starsky and Hutch) . The film will appeal to Lee Van Cleef fans .","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2747,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Western"],"datePublished":"1972-08-01","keywords":"arizona territory,tucson territorial prison,tucson arizona,magdalena mexico,sonora mexico","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1448198425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjIwNTZmMTUtNzQ2Yy00OGFkLWFkOTItY2I3ODA0ZTAxOWI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjIwNTZmMTUtNzQ2Yy00OGFkLWFkOTItY2I3ODA0ZTAxOWI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001812/","name":"Lee Van Cleef"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0694619/","name":"Stefanie Powers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0130286/","name":"Michael Callan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0566671/","name":"George McCowan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054562/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746473/","name":"Arthur Rowe"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is only my third, after Bakushu and Tokyo Story. Both of those I found dull, even Tokyo Story, which is often considered one of the best films ever made. I don't know the critical reputation of Autumn Afternoon, but I liked it a lot.

"Midareru" (Yearning, 1964) was a work, where he crafted his signature style to perfection for the final time. "Onna no naka ni iru tanin" (The Stranger Within a Woman, 1966) and "Hikinige" (Moment of Terror, 1966) where something different; the director's experiments or even forays into suspense and crime narratives. The latter featured a narrative centered around a case of hit and run, supported by a critique of today's cold mentality and heavy traffic. These are interesting films to keep in mind while assessing Naruse's final work "Midaregumo" (Two in the Shadow, 1967), which starts off from a traffic accident and then moves on to become a loose reworking of "Yearning".\n\nMany reviewers have pointed out, how this, among all Naruse films, most resembles the style of Douglas Sirk. I agree. After a series of films in black and white, Naruse got to once more make a film in fresh, summery colors, and to use this tranquil beauty as the backdrop for a narrative about pain, love, and communal expectations. In a way, it's not that far from Sirk's "All That Heaven Allows" (1955), though you could just as well name "The Magnificent Obsession" (1956) as the closest thematic counterpart. And to keep on with the comparisons, the lead-couple of beautiful people whose acting is so-so kind of brings to mind the likes of Lana Turner and John Gavin.\n\nMishima (Kayama Yuzo) is a company worker, who kills the husband of Yumiko (Tsukasa Yoko) in a car accident. He is guilt-ridden, even though the court does not find him guilty of anything. The company sees him as bad publicity, and transfers him to an office in a remote part of the country. As destiny would have it, this is also where Yumiko travels to take her mind off the pain. The couple bump into each other, and gradually out of guilt and hate, warmer feelings start to form.\n\nThe score is far from minimal, and helps to establish the larger-than-life feelings of the story. It also helps Naruse to keep other elements more subtle, and the film goes on in a pace that's very careful. The film is very reserved on the outside, and you get the sense that it hides the biggest angst deep down. Yumiko does not know how she should act when the man who killed her husband suddenly becomes a part of her life. Even though the cast of characters is small, one always has to be nervous about how other people view your actions.\n\nI don't know if Naruse knew this was going to be the final one for him, but he manages to assemble together most of the key players of his final decade of film-making. Kayama played practically the same role in "Yearning", while Tsukasa played the hit-and-run driver in "Moment of Terror". Those can't be coincidences. Other familiar faces from Naruse's earlier films include Kato Daisuke, Hama Mie, Nakamura Nobuo, and Urabe Kumeko. It's a shame that Takamine Hideko is absent, but then again after 20-something collaborations with Naruse, we can't really fault them for taking breaks once in a while, too.\n\nIn the end, "Midaregumo" is not one of the director's best works, but still a more confident closing chapter for his filmography than what his two previous films would have been. The film is a bit loose, and a bit too slow, and possibly Naruse has difficulty to make the beautiful summery landscapes work for the benefit of the narrative's internal darkness. Still, it's an interesting look at how the force of destiny tampers in the lives of individuals, and a functional companion piece for "Yearning", his last masterwork.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1062,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1967-11-18","keywords":"japanese wife,chauffeur,widowed,daughter in law,japanese woman","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0443232/","name":"Yûzô Kayama"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0875362/","name":"Yôko Tsukasa"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0476179/","name":"Mitsuko Kusabue"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0621540/","name":"Mikio Naruse"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002219/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0945257/","name":"Nobuo Yamada"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Surely, if anyone could identify with these characters, they could!\n\nSlow moving in spots, handsomely photographed in black and white, it is interesting to note how very British Leigh actually was when not assuming a more American way of talking (as in 'GWTW') -- proof indeed that she was a good actress. Of all of her films after "Gone with the Wind", I prefer her in 'Waterloo Bridge' (with Robert Taylor).

However, since both stars were at the time married to others, one can easily see that these roles suited both of them to perfection. Surely, if anyone could identify with these characters, they could!\n\nSlow moving in spots, handsomely photographed in black and white, it is interesting to note how very British Leigh actually was when not assuming a more American way of talking (as in 'GWTW') -- proof indeed that she was a good actress. Of all of her films after "Gone with the Wind", I prefer her in 'Waterloo Bridge' (with Robert Taylor). Following that, I would choose this one.\n\nSome of the ships are obvious models--but other than that, the production is a handsome one. Worth seeing for the two stars alone.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"1941-04-30","keywords":"reference to voltaire,husband and wife co star,courtesan,period drama,reference to marie antoinette","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3419717657","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ3MTc3MTYtNDE3MC00M2Q3LWI4ZWEtMWIxMTdkYTg0YWIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ3MTc3MTYtNDE3MC00M2Q3LWI4ZWEtMWIxMTdkYTg0YWIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000046/","name":"Vivien Leigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000059/","name":"Laurence Olivier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0610253/","name":"Alan Mowbray"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0466099/","name":"Alexander Korda"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0145685/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281556/","name":"Walter Reisch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0792670/","name":"R.C.

It's really a lot of fun. The cameos are awesome, they really make the film into a "time capsule" of the most popular comedian, dancer, and singer of the time.  Tony Randall has a nice supporting role throughout the film; he is great in the scene where he sees Jean-Marc Clement's "softer side." Yves Montand and Marilyn Monroe have the strangest relationship in the movie, and you have to feel bad for Jean-Marc!  He is not used to NOT getting the girl!  Yves plays this very well, I think.  They may lack some chemistry, but the two characters are cute and likable and you really want them to get together. So what I'm saying is, this is well worth seeing, especially if you are a fan of Marilyn or Yves, just don't expect it to be intellectually challenging... it is a great rainy day flick. :-)"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7000,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Musical","Romance"],"datePublished":"1960-09-08","keywords":"map of france,chest of gold coins,farmer,voice over narration,hot air balloon","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Let's Make Love","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2136932889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhhYWZmOTUtNWIwMS00ZTdiLTk3MWMtZTg1ODFjYTU0M2ZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDhhYWZmOTUtNWIwMS00ZTdiLTk3MWMtZTg1ODFjYTU0M2ZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this classic comedy starring Marilyn Monroe and Yves Montand"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000054/","name":"Marilyn Monroe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0598971/","name":"Yves Montand"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0709704/","name":"Tony Randall"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002030/","name":"George Cukor"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0134100/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0469915/","name":"Norman Krasna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0437900/","name":"Hal Kanter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007186/","name":"Arthur Miller"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The Victorian part of the film emerges from the dawning of the concept of abnormal psychology (just before Freud) and is really convincing. Streep shows us that her character cannot move on emotionally until she has worked out her own madness. That constitutes a remarkable and complex performance of insanity and self-awareness inhabiting a single psyche. She earns the gentle movement out of the tunnel and onto the calm lake. The turbulence of the unconscious -- that threatening sea of which Irons has warned her -- has been subdued. Seems to me the flaw lies in the 'modern story' (as some here have pointed out). It may be that the Streep character is trying to find a subtext for her fictional heroine, but it looks like the old ennui, so that, while her lack of concern for the relationship is understandable, his obsession with it is not.

I like the concept of the 'two endings' and their contrast, but the ending in the 20th century was a so what? The one in the 19th century was complex and included much of the pain that the relationship had caused both characters. A little more attention to the contemporary love affair -- to suggest that it was more than just a romp on location -- would have helped that dimension of the film per se and also suggested what the Victorian lovers had earned within their Hardyesque world.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12969,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1981-10-16","keywords":"love,actress,tragedy,victorian era,filmmaking","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The French Lieutenant's Woman","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1067779353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjhlNDJiMTgtNDhiOS00YWU1LTk0MzgtZWI0MjQ1NDY0ZDRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjhlNDJiMTgtNDhiOS00YWU1LTk0MzgtZWI0MjQ1NDY0ZDRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000658/","name":"Meryl Streep"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000460/","name":"Jeremy Irons"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0574436/","name":"Hilton McRae"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718554/","name":"Karel Reisz"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103522/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0288826/","name":"John Fowles"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0056217/","name":"Harold Pinter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718554/","name":"Karel Reisz"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Like the bridge, which serves as allegory, the two "lovers?" ( probably better termed co-dependents in an abusive relationship) have to be nearly destroyed before they can be rebuilt. Possessive, selfish, self-destructive, they lead each other into the abyss until the woman finds redemption through traditional values and the man finds redemption through prison. Then they are finally ready to find a life together. Fortunately, society picked them up in the nick of time, and they didn't end up on a slab in the city morgue. Not a pretty story. Not a love story. But an interesting story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13283,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1991-10-16","keywords":"vagrant,bridge,pont neuf bridge,painter,love","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3813326361","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q3NmQ3MzctYTU4OC00ZjA5LTkzNDMtZWEzMjM2MzZmNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q3NmQ3MzctYTU4OC00ZjA5LTkzNDMtZWEzMjM2MzZmNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0491777/","name":"Denis Lavant"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0345046/","name":"Klaus-Michael Grüber"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136021/","name":"Leos Carax"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005065/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064278/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044473/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136021/","name":"Leos Carax"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Like the bridge, which serves as allegory, the two "lovers?" ( probably better termed co-dependents in an abusive relationship) have to be nearly destroyed before they can be rebuilt. Possessive, selfish, self-destructive, they lead each other into the abyss until the woman finds redemption through traditional values and the man finds redemption through prison. Then they are finally ready to find a life together. Fortunately, society picked them up in the nick of time, and they didn't end up on a slab in the city morgue. Not a pretty story. Not a love story. But an interesting story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13283,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1991-10-16","keywords":"vagrant,bridge,pont neuf bridge,painter,love","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3813326361","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q3NmQ3MzctYTU4OC00ZjA5LTkzNDMtZWEzMjM2MzZmNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q3NmQ3MzctYTU4OC00ZjA5LTkzNDMtZWEzMjM2MzZmNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0491777/","name":"Denis Lavant","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0345046/","name":"Klaus-Michael Grüber"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136021/","name":"Leos Carax"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005065/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064278/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044473/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136021/","name":"Leos Carax"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Blue Velvet is his best film, and works well because of its overall logical coherency spiced up by fantastic deviations from the norm (the fantasy element of the film). This technique reminds me of Fellini's 8 1/2, where fantasy was often interspersed with a logical and coherent plot.\n\nMulholland Drive starts off logically but then gradually abandons logical coherence as dream-like (but realistically presented) sequences are brought into the plot. Then there is a shift in the plot, from the fantasy of the first part, to the reality of the second part where roles and identities are reversed and reality reigns.\n\nLynch's genius is in his artistic slight of hand where he presents a fantasy scene realistically, sucking the viewer in to expecting a meaningful depiction, then upending these expectations in shocking the viewer with the fantastic elements of the scene. I can imagine Lynch laughing in the background as he plays his joke on the viewer.\n\nThe film Holy Motors presents pure fantasy in nonsensical and unrelated sequences, and is bad art. Mulholland Drive has enough organization and structure, with more skillfully accomplished fantasy, to qualify it as good art.\n\nNaomi Watts gives us an outstanding performance - better than the typical "Best Actress" Oscar award winner's performance in the last 20 years. Watts usually gets roles that don't allow her to display her considerable acting skills, but this role does, and she more than meets the challenge.\n\nThe plot is secondary for Lynch since cinematic art is his focus. However, the movie is totally baffling unless you have some guidelines. Basically Mulholland drive is the story of a young girl who comes to Hollywood with high hopes of becoming an actress. The film is told in two parts. My interpretation is that the first (Watts as Betty) part is psychotic delusions of the young girl as she reconstructs her past leading up to the promise of a brilliant acting career. This is presented as reality and the viewer has no idea it is false. The shift to the second (Watts as Diane) part shows some shifting of roles, and depicts the true story whereby the young girl fails to become an major actress. Her identity is valid, as Diane, in the second part showing her dismal failure, while Rita of the first delusional part becomes Camilla in the second reality part.\n\nNaomi Watts thus plays two roles with different identities, in part one and in part two. The two parts are cued by the change in her name from the delusional Betty (part I) to the real Diane (part II). In a clever signal of this personality change, the waitress at Winkie's is named Diane when Betty and Rita go to eat there in the first fantasy part, while this same waitress becomes Betty when Watts as Diane goes to Winkie's in the real second part.\n\nThe plot shift from fantasy to reality mirrors the high hopes and aspirations as fantasy (Part I as Betty) and dismal failure as reality (Part II as Diane), that happens so often as young would-be performers seek fame in Hollywood but end up as failures.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":335730,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2001-10-19","keywords":"actress playing multiple roles,surrealism,lesbian sex,cult film,doppelganger","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Mulholland Drive","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4266178073","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWViMWY2YmQtODg0MS00ZjMzLThmM2YtZTFlYjM1MGRhMmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWViMWY2YmQtODg0MS00ZjMzLThmM2YtZTFlYjM1MGRhMmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Mulholland Drive"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005009/","name":"Laura Harring"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0857620/","name":"Justin Theroux"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000186/","name":"David Lynch"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022244/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007061/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038999/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000186/","name":"David Lynch"}],"duration":"PT2H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The Elephant Man will stand the final test and it will be appreciated fully by future audiences, in much the same way as Citizen Kane had to wait for some decades until audiences  were able to fully comprehend its greatness.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":229675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"1980-10-10","keywords":"physical deformity,human exploitation,exploitation,dignity,sideshow","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1763229209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjYyMzMwMmMtZTI1My00NGFmLTllMmEtNTRjOGFmNzJmZGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjYyMzMwMmMtZTI1My00NGFmLTllMmEtNTRjOGFmNzJmZGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000457/","name":"John Hurt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000843/","name":"Anne Bancroft"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000186/","name":"David Lynch"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000858/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0212246/","name":"Christopher De Vore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075015/","name":"Eric Bergren","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000186/","name":"David Lynch"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When they do so despite years of being recycled, it's usually thanks to talent. "Saw" director James Wan found something of promise in "Saw" writer Leigh Whannell's story "Insidious" and the same must've gone for stars Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. Horror films rarely get that infusion of talent, and as such, "Insidious" does not get lost in that dark dimension of forgettable horror.\n\nJosh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) Lambert have moved into a new home with their two young boys and infant girl. Like always, paranormal oddities occur in small doses here and there until one morning they find their son Dalton in a coma. A few months pass and they move Dalton back home. The freaky incidences increase and eventually Renai sees the ghosts. She convinces Josh to move them into a new home, but it gets worse, so they bring in a paranormal expert (Lin Shaye) who provides them with some shocking revelations about the state of their son.\n\nLike "Paranormal Activity" (a film thats producers have credits on this film unsurprisingly), the idea is to mount tension through paranormal phenomena and expert suspense. Wan provides a number of perfect angles and color to achieve the various moods. As much as you've been spooked this way by films before, you can't simply shirk the way the film creeps in — Wan won't have any of it. In fact, nothing here in terms of scare tactics will come as a revelation; many with a higher jumpiness tolerance will likely find it boring in many regards. No gore or horrific images to be found here — "Insidious" does it old school.\n\nOnce Shaye's character Elise and her two employees arrive on scene, the story mutates from paranormal suspense to other-worldly mystery. Elise explains what's going on — something that involves Dalton's soul being lost in a realm called The Further — and now they must rescue him. Whannell constructs an interesting mythology here and the story goes from horror to more of a mystery/thriller with demonic elements. In a sense he borrows from science fiction in establishing the rules of what's going on. It's mostly interesting, but in many instances flat-out weird to the point that horror purists might not like it.\n\nThe best way to describe "Insidious" is first half "Paranormal Activity" and second half something akin to Sam Raimi's "Drag Me To Hell," which equates to a nice balance between self-seriousness and horror fun. The "X" factor would be the performances. Byrne keeps Renai from becoming an obnoxious scaredy cat as her role's importance dwindles in the latter half of the film, in which time she still keeps Renai relevant. Wilson's character is no typical over- macho father figure or anything. Together they provide an unusual boost for horror, which typically strives for random faces with questionable experience.\n\nIn general, "Insidious" possesses a professionalism not often seen in the genre; most horror films go for cheap across the board from the budget to the talent to the thrills. Although "Insidious" lacks distinctiveness in terms of story, not an ounce of it can be perceived as immature or hollow.

Very soon, Claude falls under the spell of its refreshing youth. Claude and Grendy go together in Guadeloupe, where they engage in sensual sex.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0164128/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Nodriesrespect"},"dateCreated":"2010-12-11","inLanguage":"English","name":"Discreetly Outrageous","reviewBody":"Already a veteran of industrial movies, inciting potential investors to cough up the cash to fund factories, Pierre Unia took a sudden swerve circa 1974, switching his attention from machinery to mammaries with an innocuously risqué little number entitled LES MAITRESSES DE VACANCES a/k/a SEX AND THE FRENCH SCHOOLGIRL. Coming along at a crossroads section in French fornication film history, with simulation rapidly rendered obsolete by full color penetration, Unia felt commercially compelled to retrieve his labor of love from domestic distribution at the eleventh hour, sprucing up its mildly naughty shenanigans with pornographic pickup shots, a common practice at this stage in the evolution of European erotic cinema. A similar fate befell his follow-up feature, LE PIED! a/k/a FLAT OUT, but at least this time around several of the original cast members (including Béatrice Harnois, Frédérique Barral and Pamela Stanford) stepped up to the plate to perform the "offensive" acts themselves. Realizing there was no way back, Unia embraced his new source of employment, churning out competently crafted carnal capers, albeit at a more reverential rate than his brethren in slime.\n\nCharacterized by both ecological concerns and an oddly protofeminist sensibility, allowing amorously autonomous heroines to challenge phallocratic patriarchy, his concise body of work was initially taken at face value by otherwise knowledgeable scribes as that of a female filmmaker, the anagrammatic "Reine Pirau" ! ESTELLE ET FLORA, with its devil may care eponymous erotic explorers, could serve as a prototype of the director's idiosyncratic approach, taken to Utopian extremes with B...COMME BEATRICE's harmonious matriarchal farming community. Subverting the myth of the rape of the Sabine women, L'ENLEVEMENT DES SABINES had a group of sexually disgruntled women joining forces against male egotism. Even though there's a price to pay for their defiance, a recurring turn of events throughout Unia's explicit endeavors, his female characters have the last word, obtaining vengeance both sophisticated and unexpected for the unbridled male violence inflicted upon them, a knee-jerk reaction towards their mates' challenging an increasingly antiquated status quo.\n\nAttempting to emulate EMMANUELLE's continued box office drawing power, with video rental and cable TV a reliable secondary source of income, Unia scheduled a brief return to real name respectability with a score of four tame trifles, all of which amazingly opened alongside Hollywood blockbusters at Paris first run theaters. Nobody's fool, the director made sure to shoot simultaneous - if sometimes substantially different - hardcore versions to maximize potential profits. Last as well as least of the lot, OUTRAGE AUX MOEURS approximates a cheapskate rendition of the already sordid if marginally popular (due in no small part to their pulp print source) BRIGADE MONDAINE skin-heavy "thrillers" searching to expose such tabloid-friendly subjects as white slavery and drug trafficking.\n\nThirtysomething movie mogul Claude Farrell ("Chris Garini" a/k/a porn performer Ghislain Garet, prominently featured in Gérard Kikoïne's NEVER ENOUGH) has the hots for aspiring actress Grendy Daumier (Valérie Houlier), star of his latest not-quite-porn blockbuster DORTOIR DES GRANDES - in reality, Unia's previous simulated opus COLLEGE DORMITORY - and at least a decade his junior. Unaware she's using him to further her career, with frequent trips to the tropical isle of St. Barts a pleasant bonus (not least in terms of production value), Claude receives the proverbial wake up call coming back from business earlier than expected to find Grendy giving it up to a lowly delivery guy. Shooting his rival for the unworthy tramp's affections, he goes on the lam, seeking refuge on a houseboat inhabited by another pair of cinema hopefuls, down to earth Chantal (Laetitia Thomas) and round-heeled Carla ("Ghislaine Kerdavid" a/k/a Michelle Davy, star of Michel Lemoine's LOVE IN PARADISE) who respond to Claude's disruptive presence in radically different ways. While Chantal seizes each opportunity to alert outsiders for help, Carla just comes on to him ! \n\nWhat little plot there is plays better as (albeit unintentional) comedy with wholly implausible situations - like Claude accompanying Chantal on a porn dubbing session since they both could do with the cash ?! - and some of the most wooden acting ever inflicted upon a paying audience. Ironically the sole cast member foregoing fornication film experience, totally talent-barren Houlier proves the prime offender with the fake tan sporting Garet a close contender. Frizzy-haired Thomas, who starred in Unia's simultaneously shot FESSES VIERGES A L'ESSAI AUX CARAIBES only to disappear without a trace, tries hard but is forced to face defeat by a belated change of heart turning her character into a complete moron. Ultimately, the delightful Davy comes off best, perpetually naked and wisely entrusted with most of the sex scenes. Stateside audiences may recall she starred (as "Nicole Vartan") in Jourdan Alexander's passable sequel TAXI GIRLS 2. Truncated orgy footage - check out FESSES VIERGES for the "inside scoop" ! - showcases a plethora of recognizable porn performers like mustachioed Jacky Arnal, incredible hunk Eric Saville, chunky Frank Balard, Karoline Houtart (the chubby-cheeked chick in a nun's habit also appearing in Michel Barny's AMOUR, FANTASMES ET FANTAISIE) plus a veritable who's who of Michel Lemoine cast-offs including Amanda Shell (FORBIDDEN PLEASURES), Chantal Trobert (MARILYN MON AMOUR) and Mina Houghe (HOT DESIRES). DoP Yves Dahan, who subsequently found his niche on French TV, makes the most of movie's exotic locations yet fails to enliven the pedestrian Paris portion, notwithstanding back to back car crashes, only one of which bears any tangential relation to the nonsensical narrative.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1985-11-06","keywords":"erotic thriller,female nudity,topless female nudity,sex on the beach,barefoot woman","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307455/","name":"Ghislain Garet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859126/","name":"Laetitia Thomas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0205849/","name":"Michelle Davy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881245/","name":"Pierre Unia"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014381/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881245/","name":"Pierre Unia"}],"duration":"PT1H20M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Coming along at a crossroads section in French fornication film history, with simulation rapidly rendered obsolete by full color penetration, Unia felt commercially compelled to retrieve his labor of love from domestic distribution at the eleventh hour, sprucing up its mildly naughty shenanigans with pornographic pickup shots, a common practice at this stage in the evolution of European erotic cinema. A similar fate befell his follow-up feature, LE PIED! a/k/a FLAT OUT, but at least this time around several of the original cast members (including Béatrice Harnois, Frédérique Barral and Pamela Stanford) stepped up to the plate to perform the "offensive" acts themselves. Realizing there was no way back, Unia embraced his new source of employment, churning out competently crafted carnal capers, albeit at a more reverential rate than his brethren in slime.\n\nCharacterized by both ecological concerns and an oddly protofeminist sensibility, allowing amorously autonomous heroines to challenge phallocratic patriarchy, his concise body of work was initially taken at face value by otherwise knowledgeable scribes as that of a female filmmaker, the anagrammatic "Reine Pirau" ! ESTELLE ET FLORA, with its devil may care eponymous erotic explorers, could serve as a prototype of the director's idiosyncratic approach, taken to Utopian extremes with B...COMME BEATRICE's harmonious matriarchal farming community. Subverting the myth of the rape of the Sabine women, L'ENLEVEMENT DES SABINES had a group of sexually disgruntled women joining forces against male egotism. Even though there's a price to pay for their defiance, a recurring turn of events throughout Unia's explicit endeavors, his female characters have the last word, obtaining vengeance both sophisticated and unexpected for the unbridled male violence inflicted upon them, a knee-jerk reaction towards their mates' challenging an increasingly antiquated status quo.\n\nAttempting to emulate EMMANUELLE's continued box office drawing power, with video rental and cable TV a reliable secondary source of income, Unia scheduled a brief return to real name respectability with a score of four tame trifles, all of which amazingly opened alongside Hollywood blockbusters at Paris first run theaters. Nobody's fool, the director made sure to shoot simultaneous - if sometimes substantially different - hardcore versions to maximize potential profits. Last as well as least of the lot, OUTRAGE AUX MOEURS approximates a cheapskate rendition of the already sordid if marginally popular (due in no small part to their pulp print source) BRIGADE MONDAINE skin-heavy "thrillers" searching to expose such tabloid-friendly subjects as white slavery and drug trafficking.\n\nThirtysomething movie mogul Claude Farrell ("Chris Garini" a/k/a porn performer Ghislain Garet, prominently featured in Gérard Kikoïne's NEVER ENOUGH) has the hots for aspiring actress Grendy Daumier (Valérie Houlier), star of his latest not-quite-porn blockbuster DORTOIR DES GRANDES - in reality, Unia's previous simulated opus COLLEGE DORMITORY - and at least a decade his junior. Unaware she's using him to further her career, with frequent trips to the tropical isle of St. Barts a pleasant bonus (not least in terms of production value), Claude receives the proverbial wake up call coming back from business earlier than expected to find Grendy giving it up to a lowly delivery guy. Shooting his rival for the unworthy tramp's affections, he goes on the lam, seeking refuge on a houseboat inhabited by another pair of cinema hopefuls, down to earth Chantal (Laetitia Thomas) and round-heeled Carla ("Ghislaine Kerdavid" a/k/a Michelle Davy, star of Michel Lemoine's LOVE IN PARADISE) who respond to Claude's disruptive presence in radically different ways. While Chantal seizes each opportunity to alert outsiders for help, Carla just comes on to him ! \n\nWhat little plot there is plays better as (albeit unintentional) comedy with wholly implausible situations - like Claude accompanying Chantal on a porn dubbing session since they both could do with the cash ?! - and some of the most wooden acting ever inflicted upon a paying audience. Ironically the sole cast member foregoing fornication film experience, totally talent-barren Houlier proves the prime offender with the fake tan sporting Garet a close contender. Frizzy-haired Thomas, who starred in Unia's simultaneously shot FESSES VIERGES A L'ESSAI AUX CARAIBES only to disappear without a trace, tries hard but is forced to face defeat by a belated change of heart turning her character into a complete moron. Ultimately, the delightful Davy comes off best, perpetually naked and wisely entrusted with most of the sex scenes. Stateside audiences may recall she starred (as "Nicole Vartan") in Jourdan Alexander's passable sequel TAXI GIRLS 2. Truncated orgy footage - check out FESSES VIERGES for the "inside scoop" ! - showcases a plethora of recognizable porn performers like mustachioed Jacky Arnal, incredible hunk Eric Saville, chunky Frank Balard, Karoline Houtart (the chubby-cheeked chick in a nun's habit also appearing in Michel Barny's AMOUR, FANTASMES ET FANTAISIE) plus a veritable who's who of Michel Lemoine cast-offs including Amanda Shell (FORBIDDEN PLEASURES), Chantal Trobert (MARILYN MON AMOUR) and Mina Houghe (HOT DESIRES). DoP Yves Dahan, who subsequently found his niche on French TV, makes the most of movie's exotic locations yet fails to enliven the pedestrian Paris portion, notwithstanding back to back car crashes, only one of which bears any tangential relation to the nonsensical narrative.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"1985-11-06","keywords":"erotic thriller,female nudity,topless female nudity,sex on the beach,barefoot woman","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307455/","name":"Ghislain Garet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859126/","name":"Laetitia Thomas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0205849/","name":"Michelle Davy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881245/","name":"Pierre Unia"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014381/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881245/","name":"Pierre Unia"],"duration":"PT1H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

All of it is here, in "Il Divo" a riveting study, a wildly entertaining X ray of one of the most puzzling figures in modern political history.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16706,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-05-28","keywords":"prime minister,politician,cold war era,crooked politician,shady","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Il Divo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1745617689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNzc0OTg5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQxNzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwNzc0OTg5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTQxNzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who has been elected to Parliament seven times since is was established in 1946.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785842/","name":"Toni Servillo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093718/","name":"Anna Bonaiuto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0097917/","name":"Giulio Bosetti"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815204/","name":"Paolo Sorrentino"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0132227/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003461/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0223818/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815204/","name":"Paolo Sorrentino"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Demonlover starts out great - like a 70's spy film, only set in the world of adult Internet sites, which makes the film so much more exciting. And it looks very good, too - as if it takes place in some kind of futuristic sterile world full of bright but cold colours. But in the second half the movie takes a turn towards Lost Highway territory and in the end finds itself exactly where it headed - nowhere. Instead of giving us, viewers, a satisfying resolution of a conflict, the director drags us down the blind alley and shoots us - as well as his own film - in the back. Still, Demonlover has enough to offer to make it worth watching (like a terrific score by Sonic Youth) at least once. It's only the fact that it could be truly great instead of just worth watching, that bothers me","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5216,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-11-06","keywords":"pornography,voyeurism,voyeur,coitus,copulation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Demonlover","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2929787161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjhiOWU1NmItNzA3ZC00NWRjLWIxMTUtMDgyZWYwMjA2YTNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjhiOWU1NmItNzA3ZC00NWRjLWIxMTUtMDgyZWYwMjA2YTNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Lionsgate Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001567/","name":"Connie Nielsen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000153/","name":"Gina Gershon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001721/","name":"Chloë Sevigny"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000801/","name":"Olivier Assayas"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067722/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066973/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076469/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000801/","name":"Olivier Assayas"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Demonlover starts out great - like a 70's spy film, only set in the world of adult Internet sites, which makes the film so much more exciting. And it looks very good, too - as if it takes place in some kind of futuristic sterile world full of bright but cold colours. But in the second half the movie takes a turn towards Lost Highway territory and in the end finds itself exactly where it headed - nowhere. Instead of giving us, viewers, a satisfying resolution of a conflict, the director drags us down the blind alley and shoots us - as well as his own film - in the back. Still, Demonlover has enough to offer to make it worth watching (like a terrific score by Sonic Youth) at least once. It's only the fact that it could be truly great instead of just worth watching, that bothers me","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5216,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-11-06","keywords":"pornography,voyeurism,voyeur,coitus,copulation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Demonlover","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2929787161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjhiOWU1NmItNzA3ZC00NWRjLWIxMTUtMDgyZWYwMjA2YTNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjhiOWU1NmItNzA3ZC00NWRjLWIxMTUtMDgyZWYwMjA2YTNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Lionsgate Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001567/","name":"Connie Nielsen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000153/","name":"Gina Gershon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001721/","name":"Chloë Sevigny"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000801/","name":"Olivier Assayas"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067722/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066973/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076469/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000801/","name":"Olivier Assayas"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The first time I watched this movie, I felt a strange sense of depression that lasted for a few days, but I couldn't put my finger on why.

But the least glorious part of his job is that he doesn't sign them when these books are published. As he's hired to write the life of a famous football player, Kevin (Clovis Cornillac), he discovers that the latter's girlfriend is one of his old loves! With the indecision that best characterizes him, he tries to win her back while jeopardizing both his relationship with his current girlfriend Muriel and his work for the football player.\n\nThe thing that seduced me the most in this droll comedy as one could wish, although the director Laurent Tirard inserted melancholic moments which never break the tone and the storytelling of the film is the things Raphaël and Kevin say about books dealing with celebrities. These books are written with short sentences and when the publication of one of these books is announced, it is bound to become a best-seller. And of course, in this film it will happen. These details are minor but when they surface, one can't help but smile listening to them. Everything revolving around them rings true as well as some aspects of Raphaël's job. I particular dig the moment when to illustrate a strong contrast, he tells the audience in a voice-over that his job partly consists in turning a gloomy childhood into a victorious life where dreams come true for a star.\n\nWith his witty lines and some good gags, Laurent Tirard's film also owes a lot to its actors. With his undetermined look, his inability to properly take a decision and assume it to the end, his awkward approach, Edouard Baer is a major asset for Tirard's film. He was the ideal man for this role unlike Claude Miller's versatile "Betty Fisher et Autres Histoires" (2001). And the direction of actors doesn't lie fallow. I was very taken with Marie-Josée Croze and the formidable sincerity she gave to her character Muriel. Clovis Cornillac is also well served with his football player Kevin who is as uncertain as Raphaël but on another basis. He doesn't know which style to confer to his biography! Why not "à la Charles Baudelaire"? Unless another idea comes to his mind...\n\nThe film showcases a scene which sums up best Raphaël's antsy state of mind: he's in his car on a street of Paris. The lights turn green but he doesn't move off and starts to cry. Not only because of Jeff's death but also because of the ghost life he leads in which he acts an impostor. It's high time he set out his stalls and a chain of unexpected events will unconsciously steer him towards his real direction...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1594,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-09-08","keywords":"self discovery,romantic rivalry,pregnancy,narrative,ghost writer","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046347/","name":"Edouard Baer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0189887/","name":"Marie-Josée Croze"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180404/","name":"Clovis Cornillac"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016687/","name":"Laurent Tirard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037192/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048273/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079764/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016687/","name":"Laurent Tirard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0897065/","name":"Grégoire Vigneron"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The form of the movie corresponds to its content. Someone smart was behind this.\n\nThis is one of two movies I saw this week that exploits post 9-11 American notions of self. We need to be reassured that we are good, that the system is fundamentally healthy, that one person can make a difference and so on.\n\nThe other movie was 'Seabiscuit' which pulls on the Democrat message: little guy against fat capitalism, struggling nation getting help from government policy, all people are essentially kindhearted, wounded people and persons coming back and winning and so one there too.\n\nThis film pulls on the Republican end: lightweight and lowbrow, celebrates the simple platitude as truth, respect for the stupid but well-meaning. Even features Lincoln and has a female Clarence Thomas type.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":63495,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-17","keywords":"congresswoman,beauty salon,transvestism,the white house,washington monument washington d.c.","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2581971225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc2ZjhlYjMtODMxOS00OWE3LWIzMzUtZjJmNzFmNjQ2Zjk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc2ZjhlYjMtODMxOS00OWE3LWIzMzUtZjJmNzFmNjQ2Zjk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000702/","name":"Reese Witherspoon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000398/","name":"Sally Field","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0627878/","name":"Bob Newhart"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379237/","name":"Charles Herman-Wurmfeld"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093810/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0081041/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0113005/","name":"Amanda Brown","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0013996/","name":"Eve Ahlert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0236881/","name":"Dennis Drake"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

My husband tends to reread it occasionally, and I myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind.  We have  videos of many of Redford s movies  and we have watched "A River runs through it" many times.  Redford is part of the "famdamily" as he is always around.   We never get tired of Redford's perception of Norman Maclean writings, and the beauty of Montana. The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. Maclean's father. According to "A River Runs Through It," "Methodists are Baptists who can read,"  a line which by the way is not in the short story,  but I think that is a funny line!  My husband and I are well-read Baptists!\n\nI have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow. I disagree.  As one search for inner peace, this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three/four rhythm of the metronome. The photography is outstanding! The acting is great.  I love the scene where Norman and Paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer! Then as adult Paul played by Brad Pitt (Se7ven)  is the  "perfect guy" who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it. The same applies to Neal Burns, who uses worms as bait, he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help. The scene where Paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace! Finally after hours, they all kneel around the table to say: "Grace!" and they all leave. But the oatmeal stayed on the plate! That scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors!  That is funny! The sunburn! The drive back home where Jessie Burns (Emily Lloyd) decides to go via the train line! Beautiful dialogue when Norman proposes to Jessie because he wants her to come to Chicago with him!\n\nRedford himself does a superb job as a narrator. I could not stop myself from comparing Brad to the young Redford (Barefoot in the Park). The nominated Director, Producer, Actor, is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the US but around the world. I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television, the movies and all the technology and special effects,  to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as Redford because I have had the chance to see his works. Redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of Montana in this masterpiece. The river to me means that line that separates life from death, memories and realities.

She's been shopping around: Catholicism, Buddhism, etc. There is some tiny bit of thinking on what is it exactly to be a believer, but the movie doesn't go far enough.\n\nBut again, watch it for Tautou. She's got a certain spontaneity that is refreshing and that remind me of another Audrey [Hepburn].\n\nOut of 100, I gave it 71.

In fact, without Audrey Tautou, it would be pretty boring. Michèle (Tautou) falls for this guy, François (Baer), but also for his religion: Judaism. You see, Michèle is seeking herself in religion. She's been shopping around: Catholicism, Buddhism, etc. There is some tiny bit of thinking on what is it exactly to be a believer, but the movie doesn't go far enough.\n\nBut again, watch it for Tautou. She's got a certain spontaneity that is refreshing and that remind me of another Audrey [Hepburn].\n\nOut of 100, I gave it 71. That's good for ** out of ****.\n\nSeen at home, in Toronto, on November 6th, 2004.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2434,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-09-26","keywords":"anti semitism,jewish,veterinarian,judaism,reference to the old testament","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0851582/","name":"Audrey Tautou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0046347/","name":"Edouard Baer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0220017/","name":"Julie Depardieu"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0047645/","name":"Pascale Bailly"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032072/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0850942/","name":"Alain Tasma","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0047645/","name":"Pascale Bailly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738925/","name":"Marcia Romano"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

My husband tends to reread it occasionally, and I myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind.  We have  videos of many of Redford s movies  and we have watched "A River runs through it" many times.  Redford is part of the "famdamily" as he is always around.   We never get tired of Redford's perception of Norman Maclean writings, and the beauty of Montana. The script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as Mr. Maclean's father. According to "A River Runs Through It," "Methodists are Baptists who can read,"  a line which by the way is not in the short story,  but I think that is a funny line!  My husband and I are well-read Baptists!\n\nI have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow. I disagree.  As one search for inner peace, this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three/four rhythm of the metronome. The photography is outstanding! The acting is great.  I love the scene where Norman and Paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer! Then as adult Paul played by Brad Pitt (Se7ven)  is the  "perfect guy" who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it. The same applies to Neal Burns, who uses worms as bait, he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help. The scene where Paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace! Finally after hours, they all kneel around the table to say: "Grace!" and they all leave. But the oatmeal stayed on the plate! That scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors!  That is funny! The sunburn! The drive back home where Jessie Burns (Emily Lloyd) decides to go via the train line! Beautiful dialogue when Norman proposes to Jessie because he wants her to come to Chicago with him!\n\nRedford himself does a superb job as a narrator. I could not stop myself from comparing Brad to the young Redford (Barefoot in the Park). The nominated Director, Producer, Actor, is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the US but around the world. I am glad to live in nineteen hundred because I have seen the beginning of the black and white television, the movies and all the technology and special effects,  to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as Redford because I have had the chance to see his works. Redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of Montana in this masterpiece. The river to me means that line that separates life from death, memories and realities.

This film plays again with one of his favorite subjects, the wisdom of the uncultivated, working class simpletons, as opposed to the stiff way of life of the cultivated bourgeoisie. More or less. The story, a painter who goes back to the village of his childhood and befriends a retired railroad worker he hires as gardener ad happens to be an old childhood friend, serves well as an excuse for a series of enlightening dialogs and thoughts over class, life, struggle, love, etc. When it ends you have been entertained brilliantly for 90 minutes, and you are also left with something to think about.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3361,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-06-06","keywords":"gardener,divorce,vegetable,love,southern france","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000809/","name":"Daniel Auteuil","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201669/","name":"Jean-Pierre Darroussin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0182946/","name":"Fanny Cottençon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0065449/","name":"Jean Becker"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030118/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0077414/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0065449/","name":"Jean Becker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0181924/","name":"Jean Cosmos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2244089/","name":"Henri Cueco"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Firstly the story telling is charming, and time is spent on the characters from the beginning. The animation is more Belleville Rendezvous than Wall-E but it is an exquisitely unique experience as a result.\n\nIn this film the intensity always took me by surprise. The incredible contrast of blue eyes, a silhouette frame against the night sky. The intricate detailing of eastern architectures. The vivid saturation of colours.

Firstly the story telling is charming, and time is spent on the characters from the beginning. The animation is more Belleville Rendezvous than Wall-E but it is an exquisitely unique experience as a result.\n\nIn this film the intensity always took me by surprise. The incredible contrast of blue eyes, a silhouette frame against the night sky. The intricate detailing of eastern architectures. The vivid saturation of colours. The use of light and dark and colour in particular is possibly the most beautiful of any animation I have ever seen.

My husband, 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son all fell in love with the characters in this movie. Not only does it have great actors, but it is chalk full of great messages; lots of lessons to be learned here. You will not be disappointed!

    <title lang="fr">Le papillon</title>
    <desc lang="fr">Le papillon: Directed by Philippe Muyl. With Michel Serrault, Claire Bouanich, Nade Dieu, Jacques Bouanich. This is the story of a young girl named Elsa who was raised by a single mother (Isabelle) in the city. Isabelle and Elsa begin the film moving in next door to an elderly man who collects butterflies (Julien). Isabelle who "spends a lot of time with her friends" does not pay much attention to her daughter who walks home because her mother forgot to pick her up from school. After meeting her new neighbor, Elsa finds out about the butterflies and in short annoys Julien for a while. Julien receives a mystery package from a fellow entomologist. Julien sets out on his annual attempt to find a rare species of butterfly that he had once promised his son he would find (son dead) in the French country side, specifically a region known as Vercors. Elsa stows away in his car. After being discovered she convinces him to let her come to Vercors with him. They bond while hiking and camping until Julien, who is initially annoyed by Elsa, near the end of the film seems to have a grandfather-granddaughter relationship with her. Elsa falls in a well. The police arrest Julien. Elsa tells everyone it is cool. Isabelle starts paying attention to her child. Julien and Elsa are friends. The mystery package contained a caterpillar which turned out to become the rare species of butterfly Julien set out to find. The species is called Isabelle. So Elsa finds her mother (Isabelle) and Julien finds the butterfly (Isabelle).

Add to that great dialogue, good acting and a great photography and you got a movie that should be on the top 20 list of anyone looking for real movies.\n\nThe fact that the underlying storyline has already been brought several times to the big screen, with the same dexterity or not, does not detract from the fact that this film combines all its elements in a mix that positions it above the crowd. Serrault's movies might not all have been of this quality, but in recent years he has certainly managed to bring us several movies where the humane aspect of his characters prevail.\n\nDo not start looking for logical explanations for certain elements of the movie, do not psychoanalyse it and try to find faults... this movie is just like life itself, sometimes logical, sometimes illogical, often random. Just watch, enjoy and get carried away by the witty dialogue.

 --- Description: Le papillon: Directed by Philippe Muyl. With Michel Serrault, Claire Bouanich, Nade Dieu, Jacques Bouanich. This is the story of a young girl named Elsa who was raised by a single mother (Isabelle) in the city. Isabelle and Elsa begin the film moving in next door to an elderly man who collects butterflies (Julien). Isabelle who "spends a lot of time with her friends" does not pay much attention to her daughter who walks home because her mother forgot to pick her up from school. After meeting her new neighbor, Elsa finds out about the butterflies and in short annoys Julien for a while. Julien receives a mystery package from a fellow entomologist. Julien sets out on his annual attempt to find a rare species of butterfly that he had once promised his son he would find (son dead) in the French country side, specifically a region known as Vercors. Elsa stows away in his car. After being discovered she convinces him to let her come to Vercors with him. They bond while hiking and camping until Julien, who is initially annoyed by Elsa, near the end of the film seems to have a grandfather-granddaughter relationship with her. Elsa falls in a well. The police arrest Julien. Elsa tells everyone it is cool. Isabelle starts paying attention to her child. Julien and Elsa are friends. The mystery package contained a caterpillar which turned out to become the rare species of butterfly Julien set out to find. The species is called Isabelle. So Elsa finds her mother (Isabelle) and Julien finds the butterfly (Isabelle).

Add to that great dialogue, good acting and a great photography and you got a movie that should be on the top 20 list of anyone looking for real movies.\n\nThe fact that the underlying storyline has already been brought several times to the big screen, with the same dexterity or not, does not detract from the fact that this film combines all its elements in a mix that positions it above the crowd. Serrault's movies might not all have been of this quality, but in recent years he has certainly managed to bring us several movies where the humane aspect of his characters prevail.\n\nDo not start looking for logical explanations for certain elements of the movie, do not psychoanalyse it and try to find faults... this movie is just like life itself, sometimes logical, sometimes illogical, often random. Just watch, enjoy and get carried away by the witty dialogue. Despite all the adversities one might encounter, it's those little things - how insignificant they may be - that make it worthwhile and helps everyone become the unique individuals we are.\n\nThis is a sincere movie suitable for the whole family that manages to stay out of the tear-jerker or kiddy movie categories.

I do have to admit that I am an Adam Sandler fan. Being 21, I grew up seeing his films in theaters and for the most part liked them all. I think with Big Daddy, Dennis Dugan and Adam Sandler's Happy Madison crew really started a formula of movie. Central conflicted and imperfect character Adam (who has a good heart of course), falls in love with the girl of his dreams, who is younger and way better looking than him, all formulated around a specific central premise (i.e. with this film it's Adam's lies piling on top of lies) supported by extremely strong, quirky side character performances. This might be the epitome of this established formula, really passing 50 First Dates in my opinion. The typical Sandler ridiculous humor and smart-ass remarks are extremely well balanced with perfectly timed and executed emotional moments. The set-up for the story is pretty basic and at first almost appears predictable. It is to some extent, but the crazy directions the movie takes based on Sandler's lies is well done and only stretches a few times. But what do you expect from the Happy Madison crew? \n\nThe 2 kids in the film did a good job and had some funny lines. I am not a Jennifer Aniston fan at all but really actually liked her in this. I sort of understand her popularity and charm after this movie. She seemed more genuine and I felt an emotional attachment to her that I have always lacked with her. Plus, she is showcased in a particular waterfall scene and looks absolutely fantastic in a bikini. Brooklyn Decker is unbelievably gorgeous, as we all know from the SI Swimsuit Edition, but I was very surprised at how natural of an actress she was. She seemed very comfortable and didn't overact much. She is extremely cute and lovable. Nicole Kidman and Dave Mathews were great as an uber cool couple. Nicole was a bit over the top as she has been of late (like since Moulin Rouge), but thats what her character called for so I understand. Dave was surprisingly good as an almost drugged up yuppie, cool boyfriend of Nicole's. Nick Swardson was absolutely hilarious and by far steals every scene he is in. He really comes into the movie about 1/3 of the way in and from there on out its his movie. Nick Swardson deserves fame for this.\n\nI can't say for sure how the critics will receive it. I can handle suspension of disbelief as long as it leads to a funny payoff. For the most part these moments are delivered. It's a great date movie and a great movie for Sandler fans. He has an unbelievable recent track record for success, but this will top all of them at the box office."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":226814,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He merely (yet brilliantly) modernized them.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"genre":["Biography","History"],"datePublished":"2007-04-18","keywords":"louis xiv,poet,french history,france,french literature","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0222088/","name":"Lorànt Deutsch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868881/","name":"Philippe Torreton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271759/","name":"Sara Forestier"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0897045/","name":"Daniel Vigne"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079103/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0202971/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0286222/","name":"Jacques Forgeas"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was always the same garbage; guy meets girl, girl does ballet, guy does hip-hop, they kiss, enter a competition and win. That's the gist of every American made dance movie. Enter this quiet little film from New Zealand, and I can honestly say that I was engrossed from beginning to end. It isn't just a movie about dancers with some garbage story tacked on to justify the hour and half run time. This is a real movie, with a plot, relate-able and likable characters, and a really great soundtrack. Every worked their butt off to make this movie the best it could possibly be, and it paid off in spades. The story was entertaining, I cared about what happened to the characters, and everyone was just a pleasure to watch. The really star of this movie is, of course, the dancing. I thought South Koreans were the dancing kings, but New Zelanders could seriously give them a run for their money. These guys can MOVE. Every single dance segment was unique, original, dynamic, and a spectacle in and of itself. I got up a few times and tried to replicate the moves, even though I have no memory for choreography.\n\nThis movie was great and I loved everything about it, except one of the actors; the female American lead.

It was always the same garbage; guy meets girl, girl does ballet, guy does hip-hop, they kiss, enter a competition and win. That's the gist of every American made dance movie. Enter this quiet little film from New Zealand, and I can honestly say that I was engrossed from beginning to end. It isn't just a movie about dancers with some garbage story tacked on to justify the hour and half run time. This is a real movie, with a plot, relate-able and likable characters, and a really great soundtrack. Every worked their butt off to make this movie the best it could possibly be, and it paid off in spades. The story was entertaining, I cared about what happened to the characters, and everyone was just a pleasure to watch. The really star of this movie is, of course, the dancing. I thought South Koreans were the dancing kings, but New Zelanders could seriously give them a run for their money. These guys can MOVE. Every single dance segment was unique, original, dynamic, and a spectacle in and of itself. I got up a few times and tried to replicate the moves, even though I have no memory for choreography.\n\nThis movie was great and I loved everything about it, except one of the actors; the female American lead. She was horribly untalented, and I knew for a fact that she couldn't really dance. Then I looked at the credits and she had not 1 but 3(!) dance doubles. Why even cast her if she couldn't dance? Because she is somewhat pretty? She dragged down what could have been a perfect cast, and almost ruined the movie every time she opened her mouth.

The plot is rather simple: a French special forces unit (the movie is French/French-produced) is sent in to rescue a journalist from Afghanistan who has been captured by a Taliban warlord. Right off the bat, you are introduced to the principal characters, but not much is given in the way of character development or making the audience care, aside from some small character moments interspersed throughout the latter half of the film. The performances are adequate, with the best being given by Diane Kruger (as the journalist) and Djimon Hounsou (one of the special forces guys). The actor who portrays the Taliban warlord also does a good job, probably adding some depth to his character by having him be Western-educated and somewhat caught between Western culture and his own culture and beliefs, but not much attention is paid to his character either. It also doesn't help that his demise later in the film is done so haphazardly and unceremoniously. As far as the combat sequences go, they were fine and done in current "en vogue" style of somewhat shaky "cinema verite" realism to give a sense of the chaos of battle. The violence was effective and not gratuitous in any way. However, towards the end the movie drags a little bit as we're shown day after day passing of the core group trying to get away from their pursuers and safely back into Afghanistan (they've been wandering around in the Pakistani desert for most of the movie). Overall, the movie is effective in the combat sequences and showing how the special forces team bond with the people they try to rescue. Over the course of the film, you do grow to care a little bit more about the characters but not because you feel like you really know them, just because you empathize with the sticky situation they're in. The movie aspires to be SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (made by the French, and set during the Afghan war), but it falls short of the mark.

Still, it makes for a somewhat entertaining, slightly taxing, viewing experience.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18373,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2011-11-02","keywords":"mountain pass,stitching a wound,scene after end credits,chase,two word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2752297753","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM2OTFkMTMtZWYxNC00Y2NkLTgzYmUtOTI3MDJkOTNiOGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM2OTFkMTMtZWYxNC00Y2NkLTgzYmUtOTI3MDJkOTNiOGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1208167/","name":"Diane Kruger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005023/","name":"Djimon Hounsou","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0536095/","name":"Benoît Magimel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1360702/","name":"Stéphane Rybojad"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0304607/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1360702/","name":"Stéphane Rybojad","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0178264/","name":"Michael Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4389075/","name":"Emmanuelle Collomp"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

 --- Description: On fait comme on a dit: Directed by Philippe Bérenger. With Gad Elmaleh, Atmen Kelif, Yvan Le Bolloc'h, Gilbert Melki. One fine day, at about 10 am, in a suburban house, three men, in their thirties are waiting for a fourth buddy. When he arrives, they plan to hold up the local bank where Séverine, their accomplice, is waiting for them. This could well be the beginning of a thrilling crime story, but these tough men, sporting tattoos, are not what they appear. "On fait comme on dit" is a comedy, and these guys could be descendants of the Keystone Cops. They are dreamers not gangsters. So much is riding on this bank heist, the pressure is intense.

Right off the bat, you are introduced to the principal characters, but not much is given in the way of character development or making the audience care, aside from some small character moments interspersed throughout the latter half of the film. The performances are adequate, with the best being given by Diane Kruger (as the journalist) and Djimon Hounsou (one of the special forces guys). The actor who portrays the Taliban warlord also does a good job, probably adding some depth to his character by having him be Western-educated and somewhat caught between Western culture and his own culture and beliefs, but not much attention is paid to his character either. It also doesn't help that his demise later in the film is done so haphazardly and unceremoniously. As far as the combat sequences go, they were fine and done in current "en vogue" style of somewhat shaky "cinema verite" realism to give a sense of the chaos of battle.

CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL \n\nWarner Brothers gave us a very special gift for Father's Day, 2005... BATMAN BEGINS. Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!\n\nDirector, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson &amp; Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth! \n\nIn the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of "Super-Star". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do so What a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!) \n\nOn the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already aware audiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .\n\nFor my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .\n\nTo highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .\n\nBefore rushing out to see it, just a little warning.

CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL \n\nWarner Brothers gave us a very special gift for Father's Day, 2005... BATMAN BEGINS. Despite displaying some lethargy in its opening scenes, and suffering from some of the excesses so common in this genre of film, not only might you say it is the best of the Batman Franchise, so far, but also that it is definitely the best super-hero film ever!\n\nDirector, Christopher Nolan, who dazzled with his amazing talent in the 2000 Cult Classic, MEMENTO, has assembled a formidable cast (Michael Caine, Liam Neesom, Gary Oldman, Tom Wilkinson &amp; Morgan Freeman, among others), an outstanding script and special effects all well focused in a film that transforms a two dimensional comic strip into a work of real depth! \n\nIn the title role, we have Christian Bale, British, 31 at the time the film was made, someone who has spent most of his life in front of the cameras, without reaching, at least at this juncture in time, the long-awaited status of "Super-Star". In 2000, Bale took on another title role in American Psycho, a 'Cult Classic' which received ample attention from both critics and audiences alike. (If you have not seen this psychological thriller, do so What a gem it is! Bale is chillingly creepy!) \n\nOn the one hand, Mr. Bale is one of very few British actors (Well, Welsh, to be exact) capable of playing an American where his accent, intonation, and even body language, is absolutely perfect, impeccable! (After taking in American Psycho, I could have sworn he was American!) However, in BEGINS, although his performance seemed quite good, it was slightly below my expectation. I attribute this to two factors. First, as I'm sure Bale was already aware audiences went in with tremendously high expectations regarding his role. And secondly, with a supporting cast of the caliber involved in this film, it would have been almost impossible to stand out in the same way he did in American Psycho. .\n\nFor my taste, the only really weak link was the now famous for being Tom Cruise's-EX, Katie Holmes! Before appearing in BEGINS, Ms. Holmes never had a real stand-out role, at least in my opinion, nor really had been in many high profile films. To all fairness to her, though, it wasn't so much that her characterization was extremely lacking as much as that her performance just wasn't up to those of others in this brilliant cast! .\n\nTo highlight the very best that Batman Begins shows us, unlike almost all movies in this genre, its characters are anything BUT black and white. Just as in real life, almost all of them evolve in a kind of constant metamorphosis, responding and interacting with lady luck, day to day life events, and reactions from those around them! And they do it most convincingly, not the least bit far-fetched. .\n\nBefore rushing out to see it, just a little warning. For those who yearn for Action-packed blockbusters, Begins might leave you feeling somewhat unfulfilled! And for those who crave really intense human drama, since, at the end of the day, this is still a comic book "super-hero", not some conflicted politician, or not even anything close Let's try to keep things in perspective, O.K.? In conclusion, if you have EVER seen any film based on a comic strip that you have liked in the past, then don't hesitate to see Batman Begins...I guarantee you'll be rating it at least 7 STARS! \n\n10 SuperHero Stars...ENJOY/DISFRUTELA! \n\nAny comments, questions or observations, in English or Español, are most welcome!.....KissEnglishPasto@Yahoo.com","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1338494,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"duration":"PT2H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Add to the mix the danger of bringing a much-loved novel to life on screen, and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—based on John le Carré's book—throws an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up, making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key characters—most of whom go by at least two names—the film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed, particularly considering its reserved pace; the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression, constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film, the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache; indeed, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed therein—the brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shot—an extreme close-up of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow— affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids, giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of, and familiarity with, this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast; a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display: a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt, Hardy to Cumberbatch, Oldman to Dencik, the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together, each actor inhabiting their character with award-courting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisation—an all-too often underutilised aspect in this genre—each of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage, but ours is with them: exploring their motivations; their private lives; their loyalties; and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities, but rather human beings with emotions, afflicted by the agonies of their toils, burying themselves in vodka-laced punch to just get away from it all.\n\nHitting all the right notes in its performances, script, and direction, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity, questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives. Shot with unforgettable effulgence—committing to memory eternal every last contour of Oldman's storied brow—it is a genuine achievement in cinematic storytelling.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191073,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is the French Homeland, but more credible, low-keyed and deeper.\n\nEverything distills quality here: a really, really superb script which is intelligent, sensible and gripping to the end; extraordinary characterisation and performances from the main to the last character; tremendous production and attention to detail; credible information about the metier; an impeccable direction which keeps extreme suspense and intrigue, only without the flamboyant, explosive special effects so inevitable in American series, but it is still very action- and field-oriented.\n\nSeason 4 is really fantastic, it has not decayed in the least. The addition of Mathieu Amalric makes an extra bonus, with the talent he brings to fore in every performance. Marie-Jeanne acquires more weight in the show in the most positive sense. Florence Loiret Caille is such a superb, nuanced actress! And the priceless Kassowits recreates his complex Malotru, the antihero always full of surprises which you respect, admire and love as the seasons go by. He is the perfect spinal cord for the show.\n\nIn short, this is the most exciting show in the year.

The best spy series ever, and it keeps getting better every season!","reviewBody":"I cannot praise this show enough. I agree with other reviewers on the high bar this show sets for the genre. It is the French Homeland, but more credible, low-keyed and deeper.\n\nEverything distills quality here: a really, really superb script which is intelligent, sensible and gripping to the end; extraordinary characterisation and performances from the main to the last character; tremendous production and attention to detail; credible information about the metier; an impeccable direction which keeps extreme suspense and intrigue, only without the flamboyant, explosive special effects so inevitable in American series, but it is still very action- and field-oriented.\n\nSeason 4 is really fantastic, it has not decayed in the least. The addition of Mathieu Amalric makes an extra bonus, with the talent he brings to fore in every performance. Marie-Jeanne acquires more weight in the show in the most positive sense. Florence Loiret Caille is such a superb, nuanced actress! And the priceless Kassowits recreates his complex Malotru, the antihero always full of surprises which you respect, admire and love as the seasons go by. He is the perfect spinal cord for the show.\n\nIn short, this is the most exciting show in the year. I really hope it will maintain the high quality and the cast in years to come, to the delight of all the genre lovers. Kudos to everyone involved in the production!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9006,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you look back at Klapisch movies, starting with 'Le Péril Jeune', you realize their strength is simplicity and rhythm. He tried his style on something more serious and under delivers. Worse, he totally misses the mark.\n\nLazy is however the right word for an 'auteur' who earned his spot at the top, with the power to shoot whatever he wants. OK, fashionable 'auteurs' like Cédric Klapisch end up working with too many yes-men, leaving them with little challenging creative opportunities, but that's laziness all the same. Laziness to come up with such a flimsy script on such a challenging subject matter, and laziness to cast the bland Gilles Lellouche as the hyper-realistic financial shark that should have been too fascinating for our own good.\n\nIf it's not laziness, that means Klapisch has risen to his level of incompetence and will only be able to dish out the same youthful light comedies again and again.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2011-03-16","keywords":"single mother,predatory capitalism,capitalism,jobless,resisting arrest","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3307052569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTY4MDQ2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY0NzcwNw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTY4MDQ2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjY0NzcwNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After losing her job at a local factory, a single mother enrolls in a housekeeper training program, soon landing work cleaning the Paris apartment of handsome but cocky power broker."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0895759/","name":"Karin Viard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0500976/","name":"Gilles Lellouche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2188804/","name":"Audrey Lamy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458251/","name":"Cédric Klapisch"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458251/","name":"Cédric Klapisch"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Add to the mix the danger of bringing a much-loved novel to life on screen, and Alfredson is certainly faced with a substantial task. An espionage thriller, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy—based on John le Carré's book—throws an extremely layered narrative at its audience and insists they keep up, making little in the way of allowance for those accustomed to excess plot exposition. Concerning an approximate dozen key characters—most of whom go by at least two names—the film contains a considerable quantity of raw information to be processed, particularly considering its reserved pace; the camera scrolls slowly across the screen in step with the story's measured progression, constantly moving along yet never losing the integral tension of its hastelessness. Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action. There is almost an air of claustrophobia to much of the film, the caliginous cinematography and mysterious score combining to evoke an aura of noir paranoia. Much like Let the Right One In, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy boasts a thrilling visual panache; indeed, Hoyte van Hoytema's cinematography is oftentimes so remarkably involving that entire scenes may pass by without any absorption of the dialogical details disclosed therein—the brain is simply too overcome by the aesthetic bombardment of visual pleasure to decipher the explicit aural signals. One particular shot—an extreme close-up of Smiley's wearied face draped in shadow— affords the audience the time to study the furrowed ridges of his forehead and the weighted bags of his eyelids, giving us an entitled sense of knowledge of, and familiarity with, this character. It seems almost redundant to offer praise to the film's extraordinary cast; a brief glance at the list of exemplary names will disclose the sheer calibre of talent on display: a veritable dream team of the finest names of modern British cinema. From Firth to Hurt, Hardy to Cumberbatch, Oldman to Dencik, the phenomenal cast plays beautifully together, each actor inhabiting their character with award-courting flair. Where Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy really shines is in its characterisation—an all-too often underutilised aspect in this genre—each of them distinctly human rather than simply mouths through which the plot developments are channelled. Their primary concern may be with their espionage, but ours is with them: exploring their motivations; their private lives; their loyalties; and just how a career like theirs affects an existence. A recurring Christmas party scene revisited a number of times throughout the film reminds us regularly that these intelligence agents are not solely extensions of the government's facilities, but rather human beings with emotions, afflicted by the agonies of their toils, burying themselves in vodka-laced punch to just get away from it all.\n\nHitting all the right notes in its performances, script, and direction, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy triumphantly infuses a challengingly multifarious narrative with a deeper humanity, questioning by proxy the way in which devotion to duty affects all aspects of our lives.

But given we're in an age where Transformers XVI is a possibility, a movie like this--taut, suspenseful, well-acted, well- written, is kind of a marvel. It doesn't promise a lot: there are no special effects, the plot twists aren't terribly surprising; in fact, nothing in the movie really surprises.

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I saw the movie in 3D and at the 48fps that Jackson intended and I was blown away by how it looked. It's a stunning film that left me with the same 'WOW' factor that the original trilogy did a decade ago. Set 60 years earlier than Lord of The Rings, We are introduced to a much younger Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman). He is a content Hobbit, not concerned with adventure of any sort. Until Gandalf (Ian McKellan) suddenly appears, along with a group of unruly Dwarfs and offers Bilbo the chance to be part of a great adventure. The dwarfs wish to reclaim their homeland, which has been taken over by a huge dragon named Smaug, It's a simple concept and one that probably shouldn't be stretched over 3 movies but as with any 'first in a trilogy' film, it sets the stage perfectly. The movie has some great scenes.. meeting the Dwarfs in Bilbo's house, the run in with fighting stone giants and the escape from deep within the goblins' mountain are particular highlights. I loved the scene in which Bilbo runs into a familiar face (for LOTR fans) in the caves: Gollum (who looks amazing with todays MOCAP technology). Much of the movie, is the journey of the troupe back to the mountain, but also the journey of Bilbo himself.. mild and timid at the start of the film, our hero finds his courage, several times over, through the course of this film. \n\nOverall I loved this film, I thought it looked fantastic and the care of attention not just aesthetically but also in terms of continuity were obvious. These are Peter Jacksons films, no doubt. Much like he did with the previous trilogy, bringing us into a world full of heroes and villains, orcs and wizards this film literally (thanks to the 3D and FPS rate) literally transports you into Middle Earth.\n\nI am already excited to see the next instalment but to keep me satisfied until then..i may go and watch my LOTR boxset again .

Alfredson and screenwriters Bridget O' Connor and Peter Straughan demonstrate a keenness for the more tensely-oriented end of the genre, delving into an atmosphere of unease rather than one of brisk spy action.

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Starring Harrison Ford in the lead (human) role, it is a good natured, albeit artistically uneven film about following your destiny and discovering your true potential.\n\nIn the late 1800s, a large, overly friendly St. Bernard x Scotch Collie named "Buck" is abducted from his home in California and transported up north to the Yukon in Canada. Upon arrival, Buck returns a harmonica dropped on the ground to a man named John Thornton (Harrison Ford) shortly before being sold off as a sled dog to a pair of mail carriers. Due to him not being used to this new snowy environment, Buck struggles at first at becoming accustomed to his new life of pulling sleds but soon finds encouragement in his visions of a dark wolf guiding him through his challenges and obstacles to eventually gain the respect of not only his fellow canines but also the humans around him.\n\nAs yet another adaptation of a well-regarded American novel, this version of "The Call Of The Wild" should please casual audiences with its adorable four-legged star carrying the weight of the film through every step of the way. I am unsure, however, how closely it sticks to the original story as I have not read it in full so I can't fully determine how satisfied longtime fans of the source material will be, although from what I have researched, they seem to be somewhat divided on what has been omitted. Apparently, there have been some liberties taken with the overall mood of the film as the book reportedly has a much grittier feel that may have been toned down in an effort to create a more family friendly viewing experience. Normally, I would be annoyed at something like this happening but I actually felt more at ease while watching the film as it allowed me to take in more of the adventure without worrying too much about whether something terrible was about to happen. Some may argue that this is playing it safe but I'm not too bothered with that as I enjoy a good carefree romp in the wilderness so long as I can share it with characters I care about.\n\nChris Sanders, who makes his live-action directorial debut, having previously co-directed "Lilo &amp; Stitch", "How to Train Your Dragon", and "The Croods", does handle the film quite well, showcasing his knack for creating memorable scenery and his fluid use of cinematography helped establish the wide expanse of the Yukon and the various oddities and perils that one might encounter on their travels. However, I believe he felt a little too worried about stepping outside his comfort zone as he did overuse CGI at times, to the point where it became highly distracting. For example, Buck would sometimes clearly be a real dog huffing and panting his way through the snow while other times his movements looked unnaturally cartoonish, notably in one scene involving him jumping up and down on a bed. We see his legs flail around like a ragdoll as he tries to wake up his master but anyone who has seen how dogs really jump will know that their legs stay straight when pouncing on something. Fortunately, most of this is forgivable as I can understand the difficulty in training a real dog to perform some of the actions shown in this film and CGI would obviously be a much cheaper alternative. It just proves that no matter how nice CGI may look on the surface, there is no substitute for the real thing.\n\nI enjoyed Harrison Ford's performance as the stern but kindly wanderer John Thornton, who spends his time roughing it in the wilderness alongside his canine companion. Ford also narrates the film as well, in a manner that can be likened to a grandfather reading a bedtime story to his grandchildren, which adds a sense of childlike innocence that young viewers will definitely come to appreciate. Even though he may not have looked visually convincing at times, I loved seeing Buck and his journey from a pampered domesticated house pet to a hardened and respected dog of the outdoors. I suppose I'm just a sucker for dogs being the central role of a film as I have always had a soft spot for these wonderful animals and what they're capable of.\n\nIn conclusion, although I haven't read the original novel, this film has piqued my curiosity as it certainly feels like a story that would be better on paper than on screen. There's only so much that technology can produce before that sense of realism is severed from the audience. Despite this, the film is still worth seeing for those wanting a relatively laid-back adventure involving a dog and his master. If you're someone who loves dogs just as much as me, then this is the film for you.\n\nI rate it 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42439,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Really. I think Jessica Alba is an extremely talented actress, and I had high hopes for this movie. J horror remake, interesting premise, Jessica Alba...sounds good so far. \n\nBut this movie left me disappointed in when I saw it last night. The movie relies on cheap thrills that aren't frightening to the mature moviegoer. I should have expected this, as it was rated PG-13, but the theatre full of screaming 11 year olds at every jump was quite irritating. \n\nWhen it was all over, The Eye left me wanting more. The only thinking and mystery in the movie is done for you and the "science-talk" from Alba seems unrealistic. It relies on loud noises and horror movie clichés at every turn. The Eye is a definite popcorn movie. It may be entertaining for younger viewers, but if you want a deeper and more engaging story, look elsewhere.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52142,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There is little to discuss about the film's undeniable cinematic qualities. The biological richness achieved is also remarkable. The problem is that it is unachieved. As such, it will satisfy a young audience, or an audience of naive adults, but does not satisfy the curiosity of an adult audience capable of critical thinking. I do not deny the biological success achieved. But I do believe that the authors owe the adult audience more transparency about the ins and outs of their project. Notably: \n* What was the initial project as endorsed by the investors? Purely agricultural, or eco-tourism, or even cinematographic (this film being then the completion of the project, the farm itself being then only a by-product of the financial project)?\n* what is the financial track record of the operation? In this balance sheet, what is the share of income from agriculture and what is the share of eco-tourism?\n* what is the production (measured in tonnage per unit of area)? What is the balance sheet in man-work units?\nIn other words, what is the cost of success? My question is not a sly one. Personally, I sincerely believe that this type of agriculture is bound to develop. But if we are serious about getting our fellow citizens interested in it, we must be honest about the consequences of the proposed changes. The consequences are a larger farming population (a movement that is the opposite of the historical movement of mankind). Less calibrated agricultural products. Lower per capita yields. None of this is embarrassing to me. I simply regret that the authors of this film preferred ease to pedagogy. By showing a little more transparency, they could have made an excellent movie from a simply good movie. 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6348,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2019-05-10","keywords":"climate change,sustainable farming,farm,pig,dog","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1108326937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBkYmY3OTYtYWU1ZC00N2YxLWFjMGYtYTNkZjY2YWE5ZTdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBkYmY3OTYtYWU1ZC00N2YxLWFjMGYtYTNkZjY2YWE5ZTdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Documentarian John Chester and his wife Molly work to develop a sustainable farm on 200 acres outside of Los Angeles."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092965/","name":"John Chester"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10107265/","name":"Molly Chester"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12612142/","name":"Beauden Chester"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092965/","name":"John Chester"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0250936/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0713087/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092965/","name":"John Chester"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0598531/","name":"Mark Monroe"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There is little to discuss about the film's undeniable cinematic qualities. The biological richness achieved is also remarkable. The problem is that it is unachieved. As such, it will satisfy a young audience, or an audience of naive adults, but does not satisfy the curiosity of an adult audience capable of critical thinking. I do not deny the biological success achieved. But I do believe that the authors owe the adult audience more transparency about the ins and outs of their project. Notably: \n* What was the initial project as endorsed by the investors? Purely agricultural, or eco-tourism, or even cinematographic (this film being then the completion of the project, the farm itself being then only a by-product of the financial project)?\n* what is the financial track record of the operation? In this balance sheet, what is the share of income from agriculture and what is the share of eco-tourism?\n* what is the production (measured in tonnage per unit of area)? What is the balance sheet in man-work units?\nIn other words, what is the cost of success? My question is not a sly one. Personally, I sincerely believe that this type of agriculture is bound to develop. But if we are serious about getting our fellow citizens interested in it, we must be honest about the consequences of the proposed changes. The consequences are a larger farming population (a movement that is the opposite of the historical movement of mankind). Less calibrated agricultural products. Lower per capita yields. None of this is embarrassing to me. I simply regret that the authors of this film preferred ease to pedagogy. By showing a little more transparency, they could have made an excellent movie from a simply good movie. 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6348,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2019-05-10","keywords":"climate change,sustainable farming,farm,pig,dog","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1108326937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBkYmY3OTYtYWU1ZC00N2YxLWFjMGYtYTNkZjY2YWE5ZTdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBkYmY3OTYtYWU1ZC00N2YxLWFjMGYtYTNkZjY2YWE5ZTdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Documentarian John Chester and his wife Molly work to develop a sustainable farm on 200 acres outside of Los Angeles.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092965/","name":"John Chester","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10107265/","name":"Molly Chester","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12612142/","name":"Beauden Chester"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092965/","name":"John Chester"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0250936/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0713087/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092965/","name":"John Chester","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0598531/","name":"Mark Monroe"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I don't think we can call it a film, more a commentary on society and the youth of the time. It wasn't made for the purpose of telling a cautionary tale, but to inform. Does that make it a documentary? Maybe. It is so divisive because of it's style and topic. I love the juxtaposition between the clean cinematography and bright colours that show the darkest, most disgusting of tales. The reason this is a 7/10 for me is that I don't see myself rewatching it for a while. It is headache inducing. It is messy (intentionally), but sometimes it does feel like it is trying to disorient the viewer, which I am personally not a huge fan of.

I don't think we can call it a film, more a commentary on society and the youth of the time. It wasn't made for the purpose of telling a cautionary tale, but to inform. Does that make it a documentary? Maybe. It is so divisive because of it's style and topic. I love the juxtaposition between the clean cinematography and bright colours that show the darkest, most disgusting of tales. The reason this is a 7/10 for me is that I don't see myself rewatching it for a while. It is headache inducing. It is messy (intentionally), but sometimes it does feel like it is trying to disorient the viewer, which I am personally not a huge fan of. Also, the acting is fantastic, James Franco is hypnotising as Alien, and Selena Gomez stands out with a lot of depth. It is a shame that she left early, but it fits the weariness her character felt.

The plot is impossible to follow, as it is just a random collection of scenes that are poorly bridged together. For example, how did the girls get from the prostitution rig to a beach all of a sudden? Things are so poorly explained in the film, that I did not understand a thing. The film also shows a lot of irresponsible parenting, and I dread to think whether this has adversely affected the little girl actress. And as for the beasts mentioned in the title, I do wonder if it is referring to the scanty animals we see, or to the father and his friends.

The plot is impossible to follow, as it is just a random collection of scenes that are poorly bridged together. For example, how did the girls get from the prostitution rig to a beach all of a sudden? Things are so poorly explained in the film, that I did not understand a thing. The film also shows a lot of irresponsible parenting, and I dread to think whether this has adversely affected the little girl actress. And as for the beasts mentioned in the title, I do wonder if it is referring to the scanty animals we see, or to the father and his friends. I was thoroughly bored by "Beasts of the Southern Wild", and I appeal to all to avoid this film.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82025,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2012-07-05","keywords":"climate change,child protagonist,community,delta,bayou","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Best Picture Nominee","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi877306649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1MDQ5Mjc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk0NzU3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc1MDQ5Mjc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODk0NzU3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Faced with her father's fading health and environmental changes that release an army of prehistoric creatures called aurochs, six-year-old Hushpuppy leaves her Delta-community home in search of her mother.

You watch in complete disbelief as scenes appear on the screen and die. (* out of * * * *)","reviewBody":"The Whole Ten Yards (2004) is a comedy dead zone. You watch in complete disbelief as scenes appear on the screen and die. Every moment in this movie, begs for a single laugh, and it's as if the actors- -some who were all so promising in the original film, The Whole Nine Yards (2000)- -were promised big paychecks if they were able to tag along with the film's script.\n\nThe Whole Ten Yards assumes that the viewer has some familiarity with the first movie. Bruce Willis returns as Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, who's now living in obscurity with his wife, Jill (Amanda Peet). Both are having problems in their marriage due to (a) Jimmy's erectile dysfunction, (b) Jill's inability to fulfill her lifelong ambition to become a contract killer and (c) Jimmy's transformation into a male-like Martha Sterwart.\n\nMeanwhile Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky's (Matthew Perry) finds that goons have kidnapped his wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), and that they are led by Lazlo Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), the father of the mob boss (also played by Pollak in the original), who was eliminated in the original film. Oz tracks down Jimmy and convinces his old pal to give up cooking and house cleaning and help him in a rescue attempt.\n\nWarner Bros. has been unsuccessful in making mobster-comedy movie sequels. Analyze This (1999) was a funny film, but the idea to make a sequel was unnecessary. The sequel, Analyze That (2002), was an attempt to stretch an idea beyond its natural shelf life.\n\nBut you have to wonder why the filmmakers felt it was a good move to make a sequel to The Whole Nine Yards, or why Matthew Perry, who is playing Chandler (from "Friends") again, is unlikely to have a movie career, and why the film has been toned down to a PG-13 rating (the film cheats us of another view of Peet's breasts).\n\nScreenwriter George Gallo, on the DVD commentary, evidently has no regrets. "I think this movie is very funny," he insists, "I wrote 80 pages of genius." Apparently the scathing reviews and paltry box office have done little to humble him, as he adds, "It's like a homicidal Three Stooges." \n\nWhen Hollywood lackluster sequels are meant to be made, Howard Deutch is the man to call. He's responsible for Neil Simon's The Odd Couple II (1998) and Grumpier Old Men (1995). Deutch has also directed John Hughes-produced film such as The Great Outdoors (1988), Pretty in Pink (1986), and Some Kind of Wonderful (1987). \n\nIn The Whole Ten Yards, there is a scene that makes a reference to Hughes' Planes, Tranes &amp; Automobiles (1987), but let's just say that it was more funnier when Steve Martin and John Candy did it.\n\nBut, if you don't laugh at that, there's Kevin Pollack (again) in one of the most singularly bad performances I have ever seen in a movie. It fails by calling attention to its awfulness. His accent, his voice, his clothes, his clownish makeup all conspire to create a character who brings the movie to a halt every time he appears on the screen.\n\nThere's also the propensity of a 107-year old woman able to pass gas. Surely by now, you must be rolling in the aisles? No? Then, I will mention that Bruce Willis' character is often unpleasant. He puts on an apron and a head cloth during the early scenes, as if such a disguise would do anything other than call attention to himself.\n\nDeutch, on the DVD commentary, is quietly apologetic as he points out all the things he wished he'd changed. "I was always sorry we didn't cut this out, " he says of one scene, "I think the joke is over." And I should mention that some of the film's elements such as the film's violence (for example, a scene where a woman gets a slap to the face) don't blend well with the film's light "comedy." And if you're planning on seeing or watching The Whole Ten Yards someday, let me tell you, it's not worth seeing for a whole ten bucks on the big screen.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The sequel, Analyze That (2002), was an attempt to stretch an idea beyond its natural shelf life.\n\nBut you have to wonder why the filmmakers felt it was a good move to make a sequel to The Whole Nine Yards, or why Matthew Perry, who is playing Chandler (from "Friends") again, is unlikely to have a movie career, and why the film has been toned down to a PG-13 rating (the film cheats us of another view of Peet's breasts).\n\nScreenwriter George Gallo, on the DVD commentary, evidently has no regrets. "I think this movie is very funny," he insists, "I wrote 80 pages of genius." Apparently the scathing reviews and paltry box office have done little to humble him, as he adds, "It's like a homicidal Three Stooges." \n\nWhen Hollywood lackluster sequels are meant to be made, Howard Deutch is the man to call. He's responsible for Neil Simon's The Odd Couple II (1998) and Grumpier Old Men (1995). Deutch has also directed John Hughes-produced film such as The Great Outdoors (1988), Pretty in Pink (1986), and Some Kind of Wonderful (1987). \n\nIn The Whole Ten Yards, there is a scene that makes a reference to Hughes' Planes, Tranes &amp; Automobiles (1987), but let's just say that it was more funnier when Steve Martin and John Candy did it.\n\nBut, if you don't laugh at that, there's Kevin Pollack (again) in one of the most singularly bad performances I have ever seen in a movie. It fails by calling attention to its awfulness. His accent, his voice, his clothes, his clownish makeup all conspire to create a character who brings the movie to a halt every time he appears on the screen.\n\nThere's also the propensity of a 107-year old woman able to pass gas. Surely by now, you must be rolling in the aisles? No? Then, I will mention that Bruce Willis' character is often unpleasant. He puts on an apron and a head cloth during the early scenes, as if such a disguise would do anything other than call attention to himself.\n\nDeutch, on the DVD commentary, is quietly apologetic as he points out all the things he wished he'd changed. "I was always sorry we didn't cut this out, " he says of one scene, "I think the joke is over." And I should mention that some of the film's elements such as the film's violence (for example, a scene where a woman gets a slap to the face) don't blend well with the film's light "comedy." And if you're planning on seeing or watching The Whole Ten Yards someday, let me tell you, it's not worth seeing for a whole ten bucks on the big screen.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":54701,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You watch in complete disbelief as scenes appear on the screen and die. (* out of * * * *)","reviewBody":"The Whole Ten Yards (2004) is a comedy dead zone. You watch in complete disbelief as scenes appear on the screen and die. Every moment in this movie, begs for a single laugh, and it's as if the actors- -some who were all so promising in the original film, The Whole Nine Yards (2000)- -were promised big paychecks if they were able to tag along with the film's script.\n\nThe Whole Ten Yards assumes that the viewer has some familiarity with the first movie. Bruce Willis returns as Jimmy "The Tulip" Tudeski, who's now living in obscurity with his wife, Jill (Amanda Peet). Both are having problems in their marriage due to (a) Jimmy's erectile dysfunction, (b) Jill's inability to fulfill her lifelong ambition to become a contract killer and (c) Jimmy's transformation into a male-like Martha Sterwart.\n\nMeanwhile Nicholas "Oz" Oseransky's (Matthew Perry) finds that goons have kidnapped his wife, Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge), and that they are led by Lazlo Gogolak (Kevin Pollak), the father of the mob boss (also played by Pollak in the original), who was eliminated in the original film. Oz tracks down Jimmy and convinces his old pal to give up cooking and house cleaning and help him in a rescue attempt.\n\nWarner Bros. has been unsuccessful in making mobster-comedy movie sequels. Analyze This (1999) was a funny film, but the idea to make a sequel was unnecessary.

And while I think thats true, I think its a bit more complex than that. It also is a bit of a coming of age story where Joe has to grow up and be the adult in this family, but also it seems that mom is having a mid-life crisis (although shes not quite mid-life) and trying to discover who she is outside of being the "perfect 50s housewife" that perhaps she feels trapped in. There's a lot of symbolism in this movie. The backdrop of this movie is that there is a wildfire that has been raging and the townspeople have been desperately trying to put out. And that correlates with Joe and his own family. Hes trying to put out the fire in his own family. Also, Joe works at photography studio and Paul Dano (the director and co-writer) even said that this is supposed to be a PORTRAIT of a family life. \n\nSpeaking of Paul Dano, I think he did well with his directorial debut. I think visually there are some gorgeous shots in this movie. Like for instance where Joe is watching the wildfires (and hes perfectly centered - probably again to mimic the portrait vibe). Also where Joe is about to give up but it starts to snow and hope has regained. I liked the film for the most part. They do frame the film by following Joe's perspective. And I think its mostly effective in making you feel for this kid, my only problem is there are a couple of parts where I feel like there are gaps in the story. Without giving too much away there is a scene where Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal) has decided to seek revenge and it ends up backfiring. And yet, the next time we see him everything seems to be fine. And it never really gets explained what happened. Theres a brief line that they decided it was a "misunderstanding" but you never really see what happened and he also gets hurt during this, and that never gets brought up again either. I know Paul and Zoe (the other writer) were adapting this from a book and perhaps thats the way it is in there too. But I personally found that a little frustrating. I needed a little more. \n\nCarey Mulligan is fantastic in this. She would be deserving to have her name thrown in the hat for awards season. I also thought Ed Oxenbould was a standout too. Which is good to hear since he's onscreen for pretty much most of the movie. I definitely will be looking forward to more of his things. I also thought Jake Gyllenhaal was good but hes absent for a good chunk of the film and so he just didnt stand out as much as Carey or Ed did.\n\nOverall I liked the film. It wasn't perfect, but I would totally check out another film that Paul Dano directs.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26616,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-01-01","keywords":"1960s,unemployment,photography,infidelity,firefighter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1986312985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A boy witnesses his parents' marriage falling apart after his mother finds another man."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590837/","name":"Ed Oxenbould"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0585931/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0564372/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625497/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1443740/","name":"Zoe Kazan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285840/","name":"Richard Ford"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is a slapstick-heavy family movie that should delight young children and keep parents entertained.\n\nThe Croods are the last remaining family in an arid desert landscape. They have survived by following family patriarch Grug's (Nicolas Cage) rules to the letter, including staying in the cave after dark and fearing anything that seems new (new is BAAAD). Despite this, teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) wants to break free and rebels against her father, which results in a chance meeting with the highly inventive Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who warns her that the end of the world is nigh. When the Croods' cave is destroyed, the family is forced on a journey into a strange new world where Grug's rules clash with Guy's techniques for survival.\n\nThe Croods is a formulaic movie that sticks to a traditional hero's journey and relies on typical archetypes, but it's elevated by the writing and direction of Kirk DeMicco and How to Train Your Dragon's Chris Sanders. Like Sanders' previous work, The Croods focuses on a family's dynamic and relationships. This time, the focus is on a protective father who wants to protect his family physically and protect his daughter from a member of the opposite sex who suddenly challenges his position as the alpha male. While the trailers and first half of the movie made is seem Eep was the main character, it's actually Grug who goes through the greatest change and learns the biggest lessons.\n\nThe story is one about learning, exploring, and using one's intelligence. It also touches on the idea that it's unhealthy to live a sheltered life. But at times, the movie lays it on a bit too much with Guy and his "solutions" leaving Grug on the losing end.\n\nMost of the humour used in The Croods is very physical and slapstick oriented. Characters have Loony Toons levels of invincibility as they endure intense physical pain. This type of humour obviously appeals to fairly young children, but I would be lying if I said I did not laugh at the film at all. The Croods avoids using crude toilet humour to generate cheap laughs. There is not much in the way of verbal humour, but there are some running gags, and modernisms are kept to a minimum. They are still there but they are more putting modern products in a Stone Age setting, a little like The Flintstones, so they serve more as pop-cultural winks to adults.\n\nAs expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. It's quick and fluid, and the camera flows nicely as it follows the action. The Croods themselves have a seemingly unpleasant, bulky design to them but it actually works in the context of the film because the characters live in the wild, so big and broad makes sense. It is a little refreshing to see the main female character is not made out to be a stunning beauty, but rather someone who has been shaped by her environment. The beginning of the movie starts with in dry, mono-coloured landscapes before we get to see the bright colours of the jungle and continually seeing the weird creature reminiscence of designs of Sanders' previous works.\n\nLike other animated movies these days, The Croods has a big name voice cast and they also do a decent, if standard job. No one disgraces themselves. Cage is an unusual choice, but he gives a strong performance. There is only one time when Cage is let off the handle; Unfortunately, that is when we are experiencing the most modernism the movie has to offer.\n\nThe Croods is not going to match the heights of DreamsWorks major hits of Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon.

It is a slapstick-heavy family movie that should delight young children and keep parents entertained.\n\nThe Croods are the last remaining family in an arid desert landscape. They have survived by following family patriarch Grug's (Nicolas Cage) rules to the letter, including staying in the cave after dark and fearing anything that seems new (new is BAAAD). Despite this, teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) wants to break free and rebels against her father, which results in a chance meeting with the highly inventive Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who warns her that the end of the world is nigh. When the Croods' cave is destroyed, the family is forced on a journey into a strange new world where Grug's rules clash with Guy's techniques for survival.\n\nThe Croods is a formulaic movie that sticks to a traditional hero's journey and relies on typical archetypes, but it's elevated by the writing and direction of Kirk DeMicco and How to Train Your Dragon's Chris Sanders. Like Sanders' previous work, The Croods focuses on a family's dynamic and relationships. This time, the focus is on a protective father who wants to protect his family physically and protect his daughter from a member of the opposite sex who suddenly challenges his position as the alpha male. While the trailers and first half of the movie made is seem Eep was the main character, it's actually Grug who goes through the greatest change and learns the biggest lessons.\n\nThe story is one about learning, exploring, and using one's intelligence. It also touches on the idea that it's unhealthy to live a sheltered life. But at times, the movie lays it on a bit too much with Guy and his "solutions" leaving Grug on the losing end.\n\nMost of the humour used in The Croods is very physical and slapstick oriented. Characters have Loony Toons levels of invincibility as they endure intense physical pain. This type of humour obviously appeals to fairly young children, but I would be lying if I said I did not laugh at the film at all. The Croods avoids using crude toilet humour to generate cheap laughs. There is not much in the way of verbal humour, but there are some running gags, and modernisms are kept to a minimum. They are still there but they are more putting modern products in a Stone Age setting, a little like The Flintstones, so they serve more as pop-cultural winks to adults.\n\nAs expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. It's quick and fluid, and the camera flows nicely as it follows the action. The Croods themselves have a seemingly unpleasant, bulky design to them but it actually works in the context of the film because the characters live in the wild, so big and broad makes sense. It is a little refreshing to see the main female character is not made out to be a stunning beauty, but rather someone who has been shaped by her environment. The beginning of the movie starts with in dry, mono-coloured landscapes before we get to see the bright colours of the jungle and continually seeing the weird creature reminiscence of designs of Sanders' previous works.\n\nLike other animated movies these days, The Croods has a big name voice cast and they also do a decent, if standard job. No one disgraces themselves. Cage is an unusual choice, but he gives a strong performance. There is only one time when Cage is let off the handle; Unfortunately, that is when we are experiencing the most modernism the movie has to offer.\n\nThe Croods is not going to match the heights of DreamsWorks major hits of Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon. But it certainly does not belong with the dregs the studio has to offer. It does what it sets out to do: make a movie that will please children while attempting to give a positive message and some heart. It has an old-fashioned sense of humour that leads to a surprisingly enjoyable animated movie.\n\nPlease visit www.entertainmentfuse.com","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201412,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"caveman,journey,cave,survival,strict father","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi126265113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The world's very first prehistoric family goes on a road trip to an uncharted and fantastical world.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000092/","name":"John Cleese"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Did the strange sect do away with him because he had discovered their secret meeting? Was he poisoned? Slain by a jealous husband ? Did he die in the car crash? Or is it something worst?\n\nRomanian tourist office might sue them!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":282,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"genre":["Comedy","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-09-16","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2511585561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVjNTVlYjUtMmE4My00ZTA2LWI5ZTctZThkYmIwNTI5OWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVjNTVlYjUtMmE4My00ZTA2LWI5ZTctZThkYmIwNTI5OWM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1745743/","name":"Alice Pol","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0991511/","name":"Max Boublil","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210206/","name":"Antoine de Maximy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210206/","name":"Antoine de Maximy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0258741/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210206/","name":"Antoine de Maximy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7148745/","name":"Thomas Pujol"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When the movie had finished I was completely stunned by how the story got me into it, how interesting and absorbing it was from the very first minutes!!! The characters were so genuine and extraordinary in the same time. I guess each of them could have their own individual movie, but here we had 3 of them crossing their paths of faith. Acting was just PERFECT - honestly I think this is Bridges best role, not to mention fantastic Damon and brilliant Steinfeld! In addition to that scenography and photography was excellent.

Somehow I made myself to watch True Grit - had big doubts about it, but after all it was Coen brothers movie and it got only positive reviews all over internet. When the movie had finished I was completely stunned by how the story got me into it, how interesting and absorbing it was from the very first minutes!!! The characters were so genuine and extraordinary in the same time. I guess each of them could have their own individual movie, but here we had 3 of them crossing their paths of faith. Acting was just PERFECT - honestly I think this is Bridges best role, not to mention fantastic Damon and brilliant Steinfeld! In addition to that scenography and photography was excellent. Everything gave the viewer almost 2 hours of an amazing story, told in the best possible manner. Thank you brothers Coen for this masterpiece!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321015,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"2011-02-23","keywords":"revisionist western,reference to new mexico,death by hanging,long drop hanging,spanking threat","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Grit: "Click" TV Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1984862489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDM1NTAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI1NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDM1NTAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI1NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"True Grit: "Click" TV Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000313/","name":"Jeff Bridges","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2794962/","name":"Hailee Steinfeld"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0692427/","name":"Charles Portis"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I think the uninspired, boring story writing was probably the worst aspect of the movie overall. The characters did their job, but they weren't really memorable or stuck to you well.\n\nThe only thing that the movie was able to knock out of the park, however, was definitely the graphics.

There, Solomon witnesses numerous acts of cruelty that no man should ever face.\n\nAs I stared at the movie screen with full dread, I was reeling back at certain scenes I had just witnessed. There were good films and television shows about slavery before, and they had various nuances at how to tackle slavery. This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of "Django Unchained" and "The Butler". But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen's "12 Years a Slave" shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.\n\nSteve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.\n\nCentral to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.\n\nA fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender's portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.\n\nI was left speechless as the credits rolled. A lesser film would have added tacked-on sentimentality/exaggeration and politically influenced claptrap. Not this one. This is a movie to watch as a reminder of how powerful the human spirit can endeavor, and how lucky all of us have grown past that dreadful time in history. The full effect of it has not been felt in movies before, until now.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":655561,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There, Solomon witnesses numerous acts of cruelty that no man should ever face.\n\nAs I stared at the movie screen with full dread, I was reeling back at certain scenes I had just witnessed. There were good films and television shows about slavery before, and they had various nuances at how to tackle slavery. This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of "Django Unchained" and "The Butler". But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen's "12 Years a Slave" shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.\n\nSteve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.\n\nCentral to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.\n\nA fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender's portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.\n\nI was left speechless as the credits rolled. A lesser film would have added tacked-on sentimentality/exaggeration and politically influenced claptrap. Not this one. This is a movie to watch as a reminder of how powerful the human spirit can endeavor, and how lucky all of us have grown past that dreadful time in history. The full effect of it has not been felt in movies before, until now.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":655561,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"duration":"PT2H14M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They wind up pursuing the case of a high-ranking female politician, a supposed suicide whose body was never found. In short this is Scandinavian Noir. The acting of the two leading detectives is assured and the cinematography is compelling. It is a perfectly adequate crime thriller that will appeal to fans of this genre.

Although there are dozens of frosts-morses-lewises out there, there is always room for more - and DCI Banks is another good result, pleasant to follow also then when the course of criminal activities or solution is not totally to your liking. \n\nAlan Banks is certainly the very leading character, but he is not a lonely wolf, but a team players (with some reservations), depending on his colleagues' judgments and opinions - thus different from Frost or the Swedish Wallander, for example. I have not read any of Peter Robinson's novels, but I find Stephen Tompkinson a talented performer here - particularly bearing in mind that he has had more comedy roles to play... The female detectives, however, tend to remain somewhat sketchy, despite having different looks, approaches and background.\n\nAnyway, a good series recommended to all fond of similar creations, without too much oppressiveness and violence. You might want to watch the episodes in sequence and without episode splitting, otherwise some nuances and events related to the characters' private life may remain misty.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6519,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-09-27","keywords":"police detective,murder mystery,british police,police procedural,yorkshire","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0867017/","name":"Stephen Tompkinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0212675/","name":"Jack Deam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0522882/","name":"Andrea Lowe"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208971/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015194/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dci Banks","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi661765401","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkxY2NhYmUtMDhiYy00MDM1LWFhZWEtYTg3MzUzNmNjZDhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTkxY2NhYmUtMDhiYy00MDM1LWFhZWEtYTg3MzUzNmNjZDhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Dci Banks"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This show is so amazingly awesome. I loved it after the first episode. The plot is so thick and rich. The character development is immense. It's like watching a one hour movie. Hell, it's better than most movies. The twist and turns and the ironies make you cry for more when the show is over. And I don't know, but I love the style of everything in the show. Brenda's apartment and the decorating, the whole show has this west coast down to earth natural but not stinky hippie contemporary modern ambiance. It's just a great show and it is pleasing to the eye in the process. I'm sad to hear there is just one more episode.

This show is so amazingly awesome. I loved it after the first episode. The plot is so thick and rich. The character development is immense. It's like watching a one hour movie. Hell, it's better than most movies. The twist and turns and the ironies make you cry for more when the show is over. And I don't know, but I love the style of everything in the show. Brenda's apartment and the decorating, the whole show has this west coast down to earth natural but not stinky hippie contemporary modern ambiance. It's just a great show and it is pleasing to the eye in the process. I'm sad to hear there is just one more episode.

I'm glad to see casting chose the talented versus gorgeous actor route and graced them with intelligent crisp dialogue. I'm a guy and it's nice to see a middle aged woman get a leading role.\n\nThe geopolitics and inner politics are a bit reminiscent of "West Wing" although the ensemble doesn't have the synergy of WW's first two seasons, and the cast doesn't play off each other quite as well.\n\nUnfortunately, most of the reviews I've read thus far reveal that the public sees this show as an unpaid ad vehicle to Secty Clinton - I disagree - so tragically, it may not last long.\n\nI agree with a previous reviewer who asserted that the eldest daughter is obnoxious. She's probably written true to life: she'd likely be spoiled and entitled having grown up upper middle class in today's society with her privileges. And she'd probably be saddled with sophomoritis since she's a 20 year old articulate woman who's a freshman dropout.\n\nI also have to marvel at the negotiating/conflict resolution skill of the writers as voiced by the parents. Several times I've had to stop the program and sit at the TV in amazement at how deftly these parents dealt with a child's misbehaving or explanations of tragedies. And Tea's character displays the same art in her political maneuvering. Wow! I wish I could diffuse arguments that artfully. Or had been graced with parents who had an iota of their skill.\n\nBottom line: this show deserves to be renewed.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20959,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-09-21","keywords":"politician,secretary of state,chief of staff,political conflict,politics","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000495/","name":"Téa Leoni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004857/","name":"Tim Daly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2706992/","name":"Erich Bergen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0111281/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075256/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355329/","name":"Barbara Hall"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Madam Secretary: Series Premiere","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4153522201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY2OWVmZDctNzBiYy00YjEyLWIxZjItZGNkM2I4YTlhODYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmY2OWVmZDctNzBiYy00YjEyLWIxZjItZGNkM2I4YTlhODYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"First Look Trailer"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm not a big fan of subtitled series, but I found the lead role's mohawk haircut interesting enough to keep me tuned in for longer than usual. The rest is history. Once you start watching Gennnaro Savastano (played by Salvatore Esposito) you will be addicted. The macho man of all macho men, he looks like he could burst you with one right hook. As if one magnetic actor wasn't enough, along comes Salvatore Conte (played by Marco Palvetti), a suave slickster with an instantly addictive accent and way of expressing himself. The action is constantly moving at perfect pace, the settings are beautifully contrasted. Everything about this series is brilliant, even the bit-part players are magnetic, one such character brilliantly named Tonino Spiderman. This is a must-own series for all gangster movie/TV series buffs, and the great thing about it is, not a lot of people know just how mind-blowingly brilliant it is.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32094,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I didn't find myself feeling much sympathy for the rest of the cast (they often act like typical slasher movie fodder, especially the two kids who get high and have sex shortly before being murdered), but they're at least more believable than the characters who usually appear in these movies.\n\nOverall, I would have to say that this movie was better than most of the horror movies that have come out lately.

She invites him to a Christmas party at her office building in Los Angeles, and he decides to go to work things out.

The 80s were a time of unrealistic action sequences, predictable characters, and rudimentary plots. Die Hard changed all that. Die Hard takes place in a real world setting, or at least about as real as you can get with an action movie, so the action sequences, while insane, are slightly believable. The plot of the movie is simple, yet it's so brilliant at the same time. And the characters in this movie are engaging and a lot of fun to watch. John McClane is a really likable everyman kind of guy, we can all relate to him. Hans Gruber is an awesome villain, both cold and ruthless, yet very human. The supporting characters on the outside of the building are all great as well. Another great thing about Die Hard is that even though it's a hardcore action movie, it manages to be extremely funny at some parts, almost to a point of being able to call it a comedy. This makes the movie really easy to watch over and over again. There's really nothing wrong with this movie whatsoever in any department.\n\nThe acting is great. Bruce Willis is hilarious and hardcore as John McClane, and he portrays the adrenaline and the frustration of the situation very well. Alan Rickman is awesome in one of his earlier roles as the main villain Hans Gruber. Reginald VelJohnson is enjoyable as McClane's outside contact Officer Al Powell, and Paul Gleason is funny as a hardheaded and incompetent deputy chief of police.\n\nOverall, Die Hard is the ultimate action film because it's fast, funny, and hardcore. It also gave us one of the most famous action movie one liners of all time...You know the one.\n\n8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":808984,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"duration":"PT2H12M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Keeping company with legends such as Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Bruce Willis (who has been taking more and more great roles recently), Josh Hartnett takes the lead in the title role and plays it well. Freeman and Kingsley are as ever faultless and brilliant. Willis is fantastic in this kind of role. The dark, understated, non-action-blockbuster, big cast thrillers suit him well. Keep it up Bruce. To top off this top-notcher, Lucy Lui is looking gorgeous in her role as the love interest. I look forward to watching more films by Paul McGuigan, a director I'd previously been unaware of. Rent it as soon as you can.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":305347,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"original story,assassin,jewish mafia,organized crime,hitman","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lucky Number Slevin","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073493785","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGM3ZGM3YmQtZWNjZi00ZGRlLWIxOWMtNTUxOTFlMTRkMWYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGM3ZGM3YmQtZWNjZi00ZGRlLWIxOWMtNTUxOTFlMTRkMWYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from The Weinstein Company"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001326/","name":"Josh Hartnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001426/","name":"Ben Kingsley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006476/","name":"Paul McGuigan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063593/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1429512/","name":"Jason Smilovic"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And the rest.","reviewBody":"Impressively cast, well acted, funny and cleverly written dark comedy that is definitely worth a look. Keeping company with legends such as Morgan Freeman, Ben Kingsley and Bruce Willis (who has been taking more and more great roles recently), Josh Hartnett takes the lead in the title role and plays it well. Freeman and Kingsley are as ever faultless and brilliant. Willis is fantastic in this kind of role. The dark, understated, non-action-blockbuster, big cast thrillers suit him well. Keep it up Bruce. To top off this top-notcher, Lucy Lui is looking gorgeous in her role as the love interest. I look forward to watching more films by Paul McGuigan, a director I'd previously been unaware of. Rent it as soon as you can.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":305347,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"original story,assassin,jewish mafia,organized crime,hitman","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lucky Number Slevin","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073493785","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGM3ZGM3YmQtZWNjZi00ZGRlLWIxOWMtNTUxOTFlMTRkMWYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGM3ZGM3YmQtZWNjZi00ZGRlLWIxOWMtNTUxOTFlMTRkMWYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from The Weinstein Company","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001326/","name":"Josh Hartnett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001426/","name":"Ben Kingsley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006476/","name":"Paul McGuigan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094902/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063593/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1429512/","name":"Jason Smilovic"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

McGinley, Aaron Eckhart, Charlton Heston, Oliver Stone, Elizabeth Berkley. Directed by Oliver Stone. Spoilers herein.\n\n"Any Given Sunday" is a film that is a feast for the eyes, but not the mind. Stone does a great job for creating a dizzying direction, eye-opening visuals, and extremely loud sound, and he does all of this with the 2 and a half+ hours that he has to spare with the film but never does go deep into detail on the characters.\n\nThe story consists of a professional football team struggling with their season. The film opens with a quote from football legend Vince Lombardi, and then fades into a football game, where the starting quarterback for the Sharks, Jack Rooney is hurt in the middle of a game, unknown third string quarterback Willie Beaman is sent in for the rest of the season. As Beaman starts rising to fame, aging Coach D'Amato and Rooney begin to question if Beaman is worth risking the rest of the season and their chance for the championship as he is trying to make the team win by himself.\n\nThe performances are pretty good and powerful. Al Pacino and Jamie Foxx do great with the lead characters, and other familiar faces such as Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, James Woods, LL Cool J, Matthew Modine and John C. McGinley in the supporting performances.\n\nOne thing I did really like about "Any Given Sunday" is how the action during the games is very realistic, gritty, and fast. It ultimately captures the intensity and hard work from the sport of Football. But like "Natural Born Killers" and "U Turn", the sound is so unbearably loud and images are so fast and dizzying that the film could give some viewers a headache. Stone has been known to cause controversy among his films, and this is a way that he seems to do it, but it didn't bother me so much as haters of the film. Despite of some of the strengths, "Any Given Sunday" does have a few flaws. The film is unnecessarily overlong, overly stylish, and underdeveloped. Stone really could have made the film about 20-30 minutes shorter, and with most of the time the characters are either playing on the game field or yelling at each other. Some scenes showing Willie's rise are no more interesting than a Nike Gridiron commercial or a Michael Bay film. Another thing Stone forgets to do is add emotion to the film, and he replaces that with mostly sports action.\n\nOverall I really did enjoy this film a lot, for it's realistic football scenes and the living hell that the players go through in order to win. But at times it really does try too hard, especially when it's absent with a great script and follows clichés of older Football (or even gladiator) films. But I would recommend it to Stone fans and football fans especially.

McGinley, Aaron Eckhart, Charlton Heston, Oliver Stone, Elizabeth Berkley. Directed by Oliver Stone. Spoilers herein.\n\n"Any Given Sunday" is a film that is a feast for the eyes, but not the mind. Stone does a great job for creating a dizzying direction, eye-opening visuals, and extremely loud sound, and he does all of this with the 2 and a half+ hours that he has to spare with the film but never does go deep into detail on the characters.\n\nThe story consists of a professional football team struggling with their season. The film opens with a quote from football legend Vince Lombardi, and then fades into a football game, where the starting quarterback for the Sharks, Jack Rooney is hurt in the middle of a game, unknown third string quarterback Willie Beaman is sent in for the rest of the season. As Beaman starts rising to fame, aging Coach D'Amato and Rooney begin to question if Beaman is worth risking the rest of the season and their chance for the championship as he is trying to make the team win by himself.\n\nThe performances are pretty good and powerful. Al Pacino and Jamie Foxx do great with the lead characters, and other familiar faces such as Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, James Woods, LL Cool J, Matthew Modine and John C. McGinley in the supporting performances.\n\nOne thing I did really like about "Any Given Sunday" is how the action during the games is very realistic, gritty, and fast. It ultimately captures the intensity and hard work from the sport of Football. But like "Natural Born Killers" and "U Turn", the sound is so unbearably loud and images are so fast and dizzying that the film could give some viewers a headache. Stone has been known to cause controversy among his films, and this is a way that he seems to do it, but it didn't bother me so much as haters of the film. Despite of some of the strengths, "Any Given Sunday" does have a few flaws. The film is unnecessarily overlong, overly stylish, and underdeveloped. Stone really could have made the film about 20-30 minutes shorter, and with most of the time the characters are either playing on the game field or yelling at each other. Some scenes showing Willie's rise are no more interesting than a Nike Gridiron commercial or a Michael Bay film. Another thing Stone forgets to do is add emotion to the film, and he replaces that with mostly sports action.\n\nOverall I really did enjoy this film a lot, for it's realistic football scenes and the living hell that the players go through in order to win. But at times it really does try too hard, especially when it's absent with a great script and follows clichés of older Football (or even gladiator) films. But I would recommend it to Stone fans and football fans especially.

But I would recommend it to Stone fans and football fans especially. A very considerate 4 stars out of 5.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113668,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After many one-night-stands, he finally decides to settle down with a "dime" named Barbara (Scarlett Johansson). But not even this relationship can compare to the happiness Jon has when alone with his pornography. When he realizes his porn may be too influential on him, he begins to change his lifestyle and beliefs with help from an older woman (Julianne Moore).\n\nStories of sex addiction aren't new, having been dealt with most recently in 2011's Shame, but Don Jon feels different. Jon loves porn; he says it many times in voice-over and is consistently shown getting up in the middle of the night to go watch porn after just having sex in real life. He doesn't see it as an addiction, saying "It's porn. It's not heroin," as his excuse. To show the media influence on sex, the film opens by crosscutting many sexualized commercials, film scenes, and television clips over the credits, while actual pornography clips are spliced throughout. But unlike Shame, which treats this topic in an intense, dramatic way, Jon keeps it light, funny, and tries to show how easy it is for someone to unknowingly fall into this addiction in today's sex- obsessed culture.\n\nThe film also tackles an exploration of today's relationships. Barbara's own "porn" is romantic Hollywood films that Jon hates. These films have influenced Barbara's ideas on dating (she yells at him to stop cleaning his apartment because it's not sexy) and enforced her beliefs that typical gender roles are the only means to a happy relationship. This film speaks truths about ideas young people may have about dating in today's culture, and while spinning these topics in a mostly comedic light, it is still interesting to consider how much media pertains to our understanding of the world.\n\nDon Jon succeeds in most areas, and one large part is due to its cast. Tony Danza is really funny as Jon's father and Scarlett Johansson (and her hilarious Jersey accent) steals every scene she in. The film offers up a good amount of laughs, and the purposeful repetitive narrative works in showing Jon's changing lifestyle. Most of the film is so upbeat and fast that the last twenty minutes may feel like its dragging, but it can be considered necessary due to Jon's slowed-down new lifestyle.\n\nThe fact that this is the first film by writer-director Gordon-Levitt is extremely impressive. Don Jon flies at a mostly fast pace, has a fun cast, and gives a great commentary on sex, relationships, and addiction.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":231986,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After many one-night-stands, he finally decides to settle down with a "dime" named Barbara (Scarlett Johansson). But not even this relationship can compare to the happiness Jon has when alone with his pornography. When he realizes his porn may be too influential on him, he begins to change his lifestyle and beliefs with help from an older woman (Julianne Moore).\n\nStories of sex addiction aren't new, having been dealt with most recently in 2011's Shame, but Don Jon feels different. Jon loves porn; he says it many times in voice-over and is consistently shown getting up in the middle of the night to go watch porn after just having sex in real life. He doesn't see it as an addiction, saying "It's porn. It's not heroin," as his excuse. To show the media influence on sex, the film opens by crosscutting many sexualized commercials, film scenes, and television clips over the credits, while actual pornography clips are spliced throughout. But unlike Shame, which treats this topic in an intense, dramatic way, Jon keeps it light, funny, and tries to show how easy it is for someone to unknowingly fall into this addiction in today's sex- obsessed culture.\n\nThe film also tackles an exploration of today's relationships.

Kids are most definitely going to enjoy it, it is for them after all, not the adults comparing it to the 1990 adaptation, so I'd say this film was a success in what if wanted to do.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29556,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But this is a cheap reboot in which the 3 male kid-detectives have been replaced by 3 female kid detectives. I am disappointed that the gender madness wouldn't even stop at this old classic. In order to avoid copyright problems the question marks have been replaced by 3 exclamation marks. The 3 ??? have always been asking the right questions. Do the 3 !!! mean that the female detectives bicker and talk all the way through ? Do not find out for yourself, instead get the original.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":142,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you are familiar with the story, then there are no real surprises, but makes up for it with overwhelming CGI animation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145267,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

What is that? The word of the decade? I'd never even heard of this word before a few years ago and I'm not sure what it really means and I doubt most people who use it do either. Now I see it at least once a week. I'm still trying to figure out what 'post-apocalyptic' means. That was the popular word in the 80s and 90s for low-budget sci-fi flicks. \n\nAnyway, with the title and concept like 'The Maze Runner', the movie 'Logan's Run' quickly comes to mind. There are some similarities. Both movies are about a bunch of young people, stuck in a man-made environment, running to escape death. And in both films, there are people called runners.\n\nBut this film reminds me more of the Twilight Zone episode where a group of people trapped in a large round room escapes only to find out they were just dolls thrown into a toy bin. Too bad this film is not quite as interesting. Sorry for the spoiler, but, in the end, the kids are indeed human, not action figures.\n\nYou have to hand it to the filmmakers. They saw an over-crowded marketplace filled with trilogies based on popular teen books and had the nerve to say, "Me too!" And still they submitted something that offered few original ideas and resembled many of the films of this type that came before it recently. That took a lot of guts.\n\nThis film isn't that bad. It just feels like it belongs on a Saturday morning along with the cartoons. I still think the Twilight Zone ending would've been better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":432324,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What is that? The word of the decade? I'd never even heard of this word before a few years ago and I'm not sure what it really means and I doubt most people who use it do either. Now I see it at least once a week. I'm still trying to figure out what 'post-apocalyptic' means. That was the popular word in the 80s and 90s for low-budget sci-fi flicks. \n\nAnyway, with the title and concept like 'The Maze Runner', the movie 'Logan's Run' quickly comes to mind. There are some similarities. Both movies are about a bunch of young people, stuck in a man-made environment, running to escape death. And in both films, there are people called runners.\n\nBut this film reminds me more of the Twilight Zone episode where a group of people trapped in a large round room escapes only to find out they were just dolls thrown into a toy bin. Too bad this film is not quite as interesting. Sorry for the spoiler, but, in the end, the kids are indeed human, not action figures.\n\nYou have to hand it to the filmmakers. They saw an over-crowded marketplace filled with trilogies based on popular teen books and had the nerve to say, "Me too!" And still they submitted something that offered few original ideas and resembled many of the films of this type that came before it recently. That took a lot of guts.\n\nThis film isn't that bad. It just feels like it belongs on a Saturday morning along with the cartoons. I still think the Twilight Zone ending would've been better.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":432324,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Not only does the story seem unconventionally uneventful to most of modern audiences, but it also moves with an unhurried patience that will let many viewers shift in their seats. It really depends on whether one can develop an interest to the film and its subject matter, which shows a retired man suddenly facing the void and meaninglessness of his existence. \n\nAbout Schmidt moves slowly, but it moves with grace. The film's success is deeply in debt to Jack Nicholson, subordinating his personality to the character of Warren Schmidt. It must have been difficult for somebody like Nicholson to display the role's required lack of passion without letting Schmidt lose his human touch. Yet, his portrayal is excellent in its understatement, and his numerable supporting actors do not disappoint either. Fans of Nicholson will be assured in their belief, that their favourite is not only one of the best, but also one of the most versatile actors still working today. \n\nApart from the acting, director Alexander Payne's film is also well crafted. The somewhat saddened mood is only enhanced by documentary-like shots, constantly making us aware that what we witness is really an everyday-tragedy. The script shows intelligence, and although it contains many subtleties, most of them will not go unnoticed with attentive viewers. Even though About Schmidt is billed as a comedy, it really is a drama. Many of the humorous situations are more tragic than funny, and truly hilarious moments are rare occurrences. \n\nI've often wondered whether the title of About Schmidt has been chosen with any clear intent. The German surname Schmidt equals Smith in English and is one of the most common. So about Schmidt could actually mean "About Everybody". Everybody can wake up one day and discover that everything he or she has devoted himself to, amounts to nothing. It's a frequent social phenomenon, that people suddenly wise up that their lives are almost over, without ever having fully lived them. Maybe that's how all the sea cruises and world tours of old pensioners can be accounted for. Like Schmidt, they are all making a desperate effort to catch up on a time that's long done and over with.\n\nThe film does not exactly give answers and, like in reality, does not end with any true revelations to escape all bleakness. But there is something it often likes to apply, namely the self explanatory power of irony. Like one time during the film, when Warren Schmidt decides to adopt a six-year old African foster child by mail. A cheque of twenty-two dollars, which he dutifully provides on a monthly basis, assures that little Ndugu can go to school, gets sheltered, fed and clothed.

Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Star Wars Episode II. These are what are typically named as the worst direct sequels ever.\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be worse than a quadruple feature of all of those. I mean it when I say Paul Blart 2 is one of the most unfunny, moronic, brain cell killing experiences I've had in a cinema. There's an extended sequence where an old man eats a rotten banana that goes on for around 15 seconds. The film begins with Blart's elderly mom getting killed by a milk truck. There's a part where Blart interrupts a stage show and knocks out all the dancers by spinning around on a rope while squealing. There's a part where Blart is attacked by and beats an exotic bird while a piano player nods and smiles (DUDE JUXTAPOSITION LMAO). There's a entire segment dedicated to showcasing multiple Checkov's Guns in the form of a mall cop convention (As if those even existed). I dunno   I didn't enjoy it.\n\nBlart is somehow more unlikable this time around. Rather than a smug dumbass, he's now a smug asshole. The "film" is 50% him making fun of people, 30% Blart falling down, 20% plot holes, and 0% funny. I maybe chucked at some points, but truth is I don't even remember the movie or what it was I chucked at. I can say for sure there are more helicopter shots reminding the target audience (Who to be fair also probably need to be reminded to breathe and blink) that the movie is set in Vegas than there were chuckles.\n\nYou know that rotten banana I mentioned? Paul Blart 2 is that banana, and the man eating is is the decrepit and moronic public eating up the film's schlock yet again, probably paving the way for another opportunity for Adam Sandler and co. to shill even more money out of Hollywood for his posse. Like my painful experience with Transformers 4, people once again applauded upon conclusion, one elderly couple saying "That was too funny!"\n\nThere's tastes in humor and then there's standards in humor. Paul Blart 2 wasn't unfunny to me because it did not pander to my sense of humor. If anything it should have; with all the misogyny and ridiculing of fat people it should have struck my dark humor funny bone. However, there's no gags, there's no punchlines, there's no jokes. There's also no emotional backbone, chemistry, or even real characters to back it up. Characters literally appear and disappear throughout the narrative. I don't even think the villain had a name. I don't think anyone not buds with Blart had one.\n\nThis time around, not only is Paul Blart a bland copy of Die Hard, but Taken and Ocean's 11. The plot is a cluster-f of nothing. The first 45 minutes are, like I mentioned, just Blart riding around and getting up in everyone's faces for "comedic" purposes, with plenty of empty time given for the target audience to laugh hysterically at like a bad sitcom. The actual "Paul Blart beating baddies" isn't until the film's finale, and even then he doesn't actually beat anyone, because all of his "weapons" are stupidly non-lethal, including a stun gun that only stuns people for 5 seconds, a gun that shoots gum, a gun that spills marbles vertically, and a bean bag cannon. Two characters actually fall asleep in the movie, one of them twice. I felt a kinship to them for that reason.\n\nThere's a romantic subplot with Blart's daughter and a bellhop that goes literally nowhere and an even more forced "romantic subplot" between a hotel manager and Blart. She gets progressively wetter and wetter for him throughout the film, which to me is too far of a stretch of imagination to comprehend and accept. This also leads to nowhere. The female cop on the horse in he trailer? That is literally the ending. Blart himself is beyond unlikable and revolting. He is not reluctant like John McClain from Die Hard, he craves to be the center of attention since his saving on the mall 6 years ago became utterly irrelevant the day after (I wish I could say the same for the movie itself). He's incompetent, rude, crude, and physically unable to actually do anything heroic. He'd make a good anti-hero if he wasn't presented as this humble all American goody two shoes as the movie does.\n\nThe movie doesn't even take place in a mall. What's up with that? With truly atrocious jokeless dialogue ("I will bring a folk guitar to a pumpkin fight, because that's how crazy I am!"), beyond unlikable characters, an incompetent lead, a transparent and personality-less villain, disappearing subplots, stretched imagination, cliché and trope filled writing I can say Baul Plart: pop Tart Too is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Offensively stupid and brash, this blatant cashgrab managed one seemingly impossible feat, sink even lower than the previous film. Utterly baffling, this 1.5 hour Wynn commercial (Not a single scene takes place outside of it once they arrive) is to me the Transformers 2 of comedy, a wretched anorexic piece with no soul, craft, or effort put into it at all. The fraction of points I award it are for the laughs my friends and I had at making fun of it and a single shot that lasted a third of a second that looked pretty cool.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35805,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2015-04-16","keywords":"2010s,security,guard,security guard,black","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4079988249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzk0NTE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwMTUzNDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzk0NTE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwMTUzNDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After six years of keeping our malls safe, Paul Blart has earned a well-deserved vacation.

Two years after the show's demise, it was decided that it was time to bring Rowan Atkinson's character to the silver screen. The result was "Bean" (a.k.a.

Because of this, the board of directors plans to fire him, but the chairman will not permit this. The Grierson Gallery in Los Angeles has just purchased the famous "Whistler's Mother" painting, and curator David Langley has requested that the Royal National Gallery sends an art scholar to make a speech at the unveiling of the painting. Since the board of directors can't fire Bean, they see this as an opportunity to get him out of their lives, at least temporarily, so they send him, under the name, "Dr. Bean"! David Langley has no clue that Bean is not a doctor, nor is he even an art expert, and the painting could now be in danger because of him! Not only that, the presence of the Royal National Gallery's terrible employee may also threaten the future of poor David's job and family! \n\nThis movie's main problem is that it simply isn't nearly as consistently funny as the TV series. There are quite a few funny parts, I can't deny that, but I think most of them only made me smile or snicker, not enough big laughs, which there are a lot of in the show! Also, some gags from the show are repeated in this movie, and were done better the first time. These include Mr. Bean falling asleep while sitting down and gradually falling onto his knees and head (I guess that one is not as funny when nobody else is in the picture), and getting his head stuck in a turkey dinner (the main reason why it's not as funny this time is probably because the turkey isn't as big). Now, this movie did introduce some new and funny gags, but none of them can match some of the priceless ones in the show. None of the other characters really add much to the humour, and sadly, Mr. Bean cannot steadily carry it all by himself throughout the entire thing. Towards the end, I've found the film gets a bit tiring.\n\nOverall, I would say "Bean" was not a bad first attempt to bring the world-renowned walking disaster to the silver screen, but hardly a good one, either, they certainly didn't completely pull it off. I am only one of many fans who have been disappointed by it to some degree. I certainly don't think it's something to watch for non-stop laughs over and over again, and that's pretty much how I would describe many of the short sketches, which I'm sure many would agree with. I think most fans of the show would at least find SOME laughs in this movie, but it seems that some fans hate it, so that's certainly not a guarantee.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99609,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Steve Carell delivers a steadily funny and wholesome performance, while the underutilized Rose Byrne portrays the evil and seductive strategist perfectly.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14057,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's no masterpiece, but it had me in tears from laughing on more than one occasion - the two lead characters twirl around each other in a crazy love fest that is, even with the superhero thing going, believable.\n\nSo. Thin story, but worked out really funny and thus worthy of cinema time.\n\n7 out of 10 broken hearts","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":62503,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Star Wars Episode II. These are what are typically named as the worst direct sequels ever.\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be worse than a quadruple feature of all of those. I mean it when I say Paul Blart 2 is one of the most unfunny, moronic, brain cell killing experiences I've had in a cinema. There's an extended sequence where an old man eats a rotten banana that goes on for around 15 seconds. The film begins with Blart's elderly mom getting killed by a milk truck. There's a part where Blart interrupts a stage show and knocks out all the dancers by spinning around on a rope while squealing. There's a part where Blart is attacked by and beats an exotic bird while a piano player nods and smiles (DUDE JUXTAPOSITION LMAO). There's a entire segment dedicated to showcasing multiple Checkov's Guns in the form of a mall cop convention (As if those even existed). I dunno   I didn't enjoy it.\n\nBlart is somehow more unlikable this time around. Rather than a smug dumbass, he's now a smug asshole. The "film" is 50% him making fun of people, 30% Blart falling down, 20% plot holes, and 0% funny. I maybe chucked at some points, but truth is I don't even remember the movie or what it was I chucked at. I can say for sure there are more helicopter shots reminding the target audience (Who to be fair also probably need to be reminded to breathe and blink) that the movie is set in Vegas than there were chuckles.\n\nYou know that rotten banana I mentioned? Paul Blart 2 is that banana, and the man eating is is the decrepit and moronic public eating up the film's schlock yet again, probably paving the way for another opportunity for Adam Sandler and co. to shill even more money out of Hollywood for his posse. Like my painful experience with Transformers 4, people once again applauded upon conclusion, one elderly couple saying "That was too funny!"\n\nThere's tastes in humor and then there's standards in humor. Paul Blart 2 wasn't unfunny to me because it did not pander to my sense of humor. If anything it should have; with all the misogyny and ridiculing of fat people it should have struck my dark humor funny bone. However, there's no gags, there's no punchlines, there's no jokes. There's also no emotional backbone, chemistry, or even real characters to back it up. Characters literally appear and disappear throughout the narrative. I don't even think the villain had a name. I don't think anyone not buds with Blart had one.\n\nThis time around, not only is Paul Blart a bland copy of Die Hard, but Taken and Ocean's 11. The plot is a cluster-f of nothing. The first 45 minutes are, like I mentioned, just Blart riding around and getting up in everyone's faces for "comedic" purposes, with plenty of empty time given for the target audience to laugh hysterically at like a bad sitcom. The actual "Paul Blart beating baddies" isn't until the film's finale, and even then he doesn't actually beat anyone, because all of his "weapons" are stupidly non-lethal, including a stun gun that only stuns people for 5 seconds, a gun that shoots gum, a gun that spills marbles vertically, and a bean bag cannon. Two characters actually fall asleep in the movie, one of them twice. I felt a kinship to them for that reason.\n\nThere's a romantic subplot with Blart's daughter and a bellhop that goes literally nowhere and an even more forced "romantic subplot" between a hotel manager and Blart. She gets progressively wetter and wetter for him throughout the film, which to me is too far of a stretch of imagination to comprehend and accept. This also leads to nowhere. The female cop on the horse in he trailer? That is literally the ending. Blart himself is beyond unlikable and revolting. He is not reluctant like John McClain from Die Hard, he craves to be the center of attention since his saving on the mall 6 years ago became utterly irrelevant the day after (I wish I could say the same for the movie itself). He's incompetent, rude, crude, and physically unable to actually do anything heroic. He'd make a good anti-hero if he wasn't presented as this humble all American goody two shoes as the movie does.\n\nThe movie doesn't even take place in a mall. What's up with that? With truly atrocious jokeless dialogue ("I will bring a folk guitar to a pumpkin fight, because that's how crazy I am!"), beyond unlikable characters, an incompetent lead, a transparent and personality-less villain, disappearing subplots, stretched imagination, cliché and trope filled writing I can say Baul Plart: pop Tart Too is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Offensively stupid and brash, this blatant cashgrab managed one seemingly impossible feat, sink even lower than the previous film. Utterly baffling, this 1.5 hour Wynn commercial (Not a single scene takes place outside of it once they arrive) is to me the Transformers 2 of comedy, a wretched anorexic piece with no soul, craft, or effort put into it at all.

Caddyshack 2. Exorcist 2. Star Wars Episode II. These are what are typically named as the worst direct sequels ever.\n\nPaul Blart: Mall Cop 2 may be worse than a quadruple feature of all of those. I mean it when I say Paul Blart 2 is one of the most unfunny, moronic, brain cell killing experiences I've had in a cinema. There's an extended sequence where an old man eats a rotten banana that goes on for around 15 seconds. The film begins with Blart's elderly mom getting killed by a milk truck. There's a part where Blart interrupts a stage show and knocks out all the dancers by spinning around on a rope while squealing. There's a part where Blart is attacked by and beats an exotic bird while a piano player nods and smiles (DUDE JUXTAPOSITION LMAO). There's a entire segment dedicated to showcasing multiple Checkov's Guns in the form of a mall cop convention (As if those even existed). I dunno   I didn't enjoy it.\n\nBlart is somehow more unlikable this time around. Rather than a smug dumbass, he's now a smug asshole. The "film" is 50% him making fun of people, 30% Blart falling down, 20% plot holes, and 0% funny. I maybe chucked at some points, but truth is I don't even remember the movie or what it was I chucked at. I can say for sure there are more helicopter shots reminding the target audience (Who to be fair also probably need to be reminded to breathe and blink) that the movie is set in Vegas than there were chuckles.\n\nYou know that rotten banana I mentioned? Paul Blart 2 is that banana, and the man eating is is the decrepit and moronic public eating up the film's schlock yet again, probably paving the way for another opportunity for Adam Sandler and co. to shill even more money out of Hollywood for his posse. Like my painful experience with Transformers 4, people once again applauded upon conclusion, one elderly couple saying "That was too funny!"\n\nThere's tastes in humor and then there's standards in humor. Paul Blart 2 wasn't unfunny to me because it did not pander to my sense of humor. If anything it should have; with all the misogyny and ridiculing of fat people it should have struck my dark humor funny bone. However, there's no gags, there's no punchlines, there's no jokes. There's also no emotional backbone, chemistry, or even real characters to back it up. Characters literally appear and disappear throughout the narrative. I don't even think the villain had a name. I don't think anyone not buds with Blart had one.\n\nThis time around, not only is Paul Blart a bland copy of Die Hard, but Taken and Ocean's 11. The plot is a cluster-f of nothing. The first 45 minutes are, like I mentioned, just Blart riding around and getting up in everyone's faces for "comedic" purposes, with plenty of empty time given for the target audience to laugh hysterically at like a bad sitcom. The actual "Paul Blart beating baddies" isn't until the film's finale, and even then he doesn't actually beat anyone, because all of his "weapons" are stupidly non-lethal, including a stun gun that only stuns people for 5 seconds, a gun that shoots gum, a gun that spills marbles vertically, and a bean bag cannon. Two characters actually fall asleep in the movie, one of them twice. I felt a kinship to them for that reason.\n\nThere's a romantic subplot with Blart's daughter and a bellhop that goes literally nowhere and an even more forced "romantic subplot" between a hotel manager and Blart. She gets progressively wetter and wetter for him throughout the film, which to me is too far of a stretch of imagination to comprehend and accept. This also leads to nowhere. The female cop on the horse in he trailer? That is literally the ending. Blart himself is beyond unlikable and revolting. He is not reluctant like John McClain from Die Hard, he craves to be the center of attention since his saving on the mall 6 years ago became utterly irrelevant the day after (I wish I could say the same for the movie itself). He's incompetent, rude, crude, and physically unable to actually do anything heroic. He'd make a good anti-hero if he wasn't presented as this humble all American goody two shoes as the movie does.\n\nThe movie doesn't even take place in a mall. What's up with that? With truly atrocious jokeless dialogue ("I will bring a folk guitar to a pumpkin fight, because that's how crazy I am!"), beyond unlikable characters, an incompetent lead, a transparent and personality-less villain, disappearing subplots, stretched imagination, cliché and trope filled writing I can say Baul Plart: pop Tart Too is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Offensively stupid and brash, this blatant cashgrab managed one seemingly impossible feat, sink even lower than the previous film. Utterly baffling, this 1.5 hour Wynn commercial (Not a single scene takes place outside of it once they arrive) is to me the Transformers 2 of comedy, a wretched anorexic piece with no soul, craft, or effort put into it at all. The fraction of points I award it are for the laughs my friends and I had at making fun of it and a single shot that lasted a third of a second that looked pretty cool.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35805,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2015-04-16","keywords":"2010s,security,guard,security guard,black","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4079988249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzk0NTE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwMTUzNDE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAwNzk0NTE3Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgwMTUzNDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After six years of keeping our malls safe, Paul Blart has earned a well-deserved vacation.

I wasn't sure whether to expect a children's movie or adult movie, and it came out to be more like the latter. I grew up reading &amp; watching "Goosebumps", and this movie made me feel like I was watching a "Goosebumps" film tailored for adults.\n\nJohn C. Reilly does a really great job acting; it's nice to see him do something more challenging again. If you are turned off by his work in movies like Walk Hard, Talladega Nights, etc., give him a chance in this movie. He really impressed me. Patrick Fugit was my favorite actor in the film; his character was visually an eyesore but also in some odd way incredibly adorable. And Chris Massoglia, of course, was a great lead actor. \n\nI would watch this film again when it officially comes out in theaters.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":44217,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2009-12-09","keywords":"vampire versus vampire,based on young adult novel,circus freak,freakshow,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant -- Darren and Steve Buy Tickets","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3629056537","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA2MzQ0NzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY4MDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA2MzQ0NzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY4MDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A clip from Cirque du Freak: The Vampire's Assistant.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1491631/","name":"Chris Massoglia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000604/","name":"John C.

He is captured and imprisoned by a strange vampire and his bloodsucker girlfriends . He really is a 15th-century Romanian warrior who lives on through the ages and gone back life . Avenging the death of his beloved wife ; the undead vampire named Dracula (Gary Oldman , among those who auditioned for the part were Andy Garcia , Gabriel Byrne, Armand Assante, Antonio Banderas and Viggo Mortensen) comes to England to seduce a visitor's fiancée (Winona Rider) and inflict havoc in the foreign land . As it is said that Dracula has extraordinary powers , but these supernatural powers have sinister origins . Dracula starts a reign of seduction and horror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy (Sadie Frost) . But Dracula has not counted on young Lords (Gary Elwes , Bill Campbell , Keanu Reeves) acquiring the assistance of the Vampire expert Prof. Abraham Van Helsing 8anthony Hopkins) .\n\nColorful version about the famous personage with an all-star cast , brilliant cinematography by Michael Balhaus , glamorous gowns and spectacular production design by Thomas Sanders , including evocative sights on Victorian London . And special mention to rousing and powerful musical score composed and conducted by Wojciech Kilar . This thrilling as well as sumptuous film contains horrifying scenes , chills , lots of gore and red jelly was used for the blood . Interesting script by writer James V. Hart , he started writing the screenplay in 1977 ; according to him, David Lean was the first choice to direct the movie, but was unavailable as he was working on Nostromo, which was eventually shelved after his death . Gary Oldman brings something unique to the vampire role, somewhere between Max Schreck's hideous Count Orlok , the debonair Lugosi/Lee/Langela Dracula and a wolfman makeup lookalike , Oldman may well exude some sort of animal magnetism to women, but is still a hideous fanged beast on the prowl . High-budgeted film , though to keep the budget manageable, Columbia insisted that the film be shot in Los Angeles and not on location. Costume designer Eiko Ishioka -who won an Oscar for the movie and previously had dressed in ¨Mishima¨ produced by Coppola- had never seen a Dracula movie prior to being hired for this film ; she was initially hired as the art director, but when Francis Ford Coppola saw some of her costume sketches, he immediately asked her to work as the costume designer. The motion picture was exquisitely realized by the genius Ford Coppola . The picture achieved success at box office , as earnings from the film was enough to save Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola's studio) from bankruptcy after suffering from financial difficulties and liabilities of $27 million over the past 3 years. Dracula deservedly won Academy Awards for editing , sound effects , costume design and makeup. \n\nThis version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 classic novel of the same name ; other films retelling the known legend based as originally conceived on this novel are the following : "Bram Stoker's Count Dracula" (1970) by Jesus Franco with Christopher Lee , Hebert Lom , Maria Rohm , Klaus Kinski ; ¨ Dracula¨ (1974) by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance , Simon Ward ,Nigel Davenport , ¨Bram's Stoker Dracula'with David Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing , Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Myles as Lucy ; and last version ¨Dracula¨2012 by Dario Argento with Rutger Hauer as Abraham Van Helsing , Asia Argento as Lucy , Unax Ugalde as Johnathan Harker and Thomas Kretschmann as Dracula .","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":199555,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"duration":"PT2H8M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Avenging the death of his beloved wife ; the undead vampire named Dracula (Gary Oldman , among those who auditioned for the part were Andy Garcia , Gabriel Byrne, Armand Assante, Antonio Banderas and Viggo Mortensen) comes to England to seduce a visitor's fiancée (Winona Rider) and inflict havoc in the foreign land . As it is said that Dracula has extraordinary powers , but these supernatural powers have sinister origins . Dracula starts a reign of seduction and horror, draining the life from Mina's closest friend, Lucy (Sadie Frost) . But Dracula has not counted on young Lords (Gary Elwes , Bill Campbell , Keanu Reeves) acquiring the assistance of the Vampire expert Prof. Abraham Van Helsing 8anthony Hopkins) .\n\nColorful version about the famous personage with an all-star cast , brilliant cinematography by Michael Balhaus , glamorous gowns and spectacular production design by Thomas Sanders , including evocative sights on Victorian London . And special mention to rousing and powerful musical score composed and conducted by Wojciech Kilar . This thrilling as well as sumptuous film contains horrifying scenes , chills , lots of gore and red jelly was used for the blood . Interesting script by writer James V. Hart , he started writing the screenplay in 1977 ; according to him, David Lean was the first choice to direct the movie, but was unavailable as he was working on Nostromo, which was eventually shelved after his death . Gary Oldman brings something unique to the vampire role, somewhere between Max Schreck's hideous Count Orlok , the debonair Lugosi/Lee/Langela Dracula and a wolfman makeup lookalike , Oldman may well exude some sort of animal magnetism to women, but is still a hideous fanged beast on the prowl . High-budgeted film , though to keep the budget manageable, Columbia insisted that the film be shot in Los Angeles and not on location. Costume designer Eiko Ishioka -who won an Oscar for the movie and previously had dressed in ¨Mishima¨ produced by Coppola- had never seen a Dracula movie prior to being hired for this film ; she was initially hired as the art director, but when Francis Ford Coppola saw some of her costume sketches, he immediately asked her to work as the costume designer. The motion picture was exquisitely realized by the genius Ford Coppola . The picture achieved success at box office , as earnings from the film was enough to save Zoetrope (Francis Ford Coppola's studio) from bankruptcy after suffering from financial difficulties and liabilities of $27 million over the past 3 years. Dracula deservedly won Academy Awards for editing , sound effects , costume design and makeup. \n\nThis version of Dracula is closely based on Bram Stoker's 1897 classic novel of the same name ; other films retelling the known legend based as originally conceived on this novel are the following : "Bram Stoker's Count Dracula" (1970) by Jesus Franco with Christopher Lee , Hebert Lom , Maria Rohm , Klaus Kinski ; ¨ Dracula¨ (1974) by Dan Curtis with Jack Palance , Simon Ward ,Nigel Davenport , ¨Bram's Stoker Dracula'with David Suchet as Abraham Van Helsing , Marc Warren as Count Dracula and Sophia Myles as Lucy ; and last version ¨Dracula¨2012 by Dario Argento with Rutger Hauer as Abraham Van Helsing , Asia Argento as Lucy , Unax Ugalde as Johnathan Harker and Thomas Kretschmann as Dracula .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":199555,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

One nasty road accident later, the annoyingly whiny female passenger of the car they just hit is dragged off into the woods by a mostly unseen creature which rips the woman to shreds - and good riddance. Ellie and Jimmy do not escape unscathed themselves. The creature has mildly injured them both and soon, brother and sister are experiencing heightened senses and suffering the Mark of the Beast on the palm of their hands. For Jimmy, it's a blessing in disguise as he returns to high school and battles the school bully. For Ellie, it's the first step on the path towards discovering who the real monster is, and the suspects are numerous. Will she and her brother discover the identity of the beast in time to save themselves from the curse? Or will they too become full fledged werewolves at the next full moon?\n\n"Cursed" doesn't take itself very seriously as a horror film, or as a comedy. It seems to be trying to decide which it wanted to be, and hadn't made up its mind in time for the closing credits. There are a few genuine laughs to be found throughout, and some nifty references to the bygone days of Universal Creature Features, but for the most part this is a silly, airbrushed effort, filled with Beautiful People acting stupidly. I should have considered myself warned when I saw Scott Baio's name in the opening credits. The werewolf itself has a few good scenes, but I was kind of disappointed to see the legendary Rick Baker's name in the credits, and then find myself face to face with a CGI beast later on. And what was Christina Ricci doing in this? Did she lose a bet with Wes Craven or something?\n\nThis film might have fared better in the 80s, but it seems somewhat lifeless and unimaginative these days. I'm just glad I had a free pass, otherwise I would be feeling profoundly ripped off right about now.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31037,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One nasty road accident later, the annoyingly whiny female passenger of the car they just hit is dragged off into the woods by a mostly unseen creature which rips the woman to shreds - and good riddance. Ellie and Jimmy do not escape unscathed themselves. The creature has mildly injured them both and soon, brother and sister are experiencing heightened senses and suffering the Mark of the Beast on the palm of their hands. For Jimmy, it's a blessing in disguise as he returns to high school and battles the school bully. For Ellie, it's the first step on the path towards discovering who the real monster is, and the suspects are numerous. Will she and her brother discover the identity of the beast in time to save themselves from the curse? Or will they too become full fledged werewolves at the next full moon?\n\n"Cursed" doesn't take itself very seriously as a horror film, or as a comedy. It seems to be trying to decide which it wanted to be, and hadn't made up its mind in time for the closing credits. There are a few genuine laughs to be found throughout, and some nifty references to the bygone days of Universal Creature Features, but for the most part this is a silly, airbrushed effort, filled with Beautiful People acting stupidly. I should have considered myself warned when I saw Scott Baio's name in the opening credits. The werewolf itself has a few good scenes, but I was kind of disappointed to see the legendary Rick Baker's name in the credits, and then find myself face to face with a CGI beast later on. And what was Christina Ricci doing in this? Did she lose a bet with Wes Craven or something?\n\nThis film might have fared better in the 80s, but it seems somewhat lifeless and unimaginative these days. I'm just glad I had a free pass, otherwise I would be feeling profoundly ripped off right about now.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31037,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And the geography? The location of the buildings don't match up. The costumes, Ottoman swords are completely wrong. And Mehmed II, the future conqueror of Constatinople was also 10 years old at that time, but he magically grew up I guess. When Ottoman characters speak Turkish, it sounds like my French students who've just started learning the language. How cringy is that, like, really, could they at least not find the actors proper dialect coaches so that they could be a bit more convincing while pronouncing these two sentences?\n\nIf they think they can sell trash to the audience and not respect them, long live paid streaming channels.

And there's nothing wrong with creating a fictional story based on myths and legends. But when you say Beijing is in Alaska, and the Chinese character in the movie sounds French, there's no way you can sell this cringeworthy, embarassing movie to an audience, who thankfully has access to internet and can look up for the facts.\n\nIt's said that the year is 1442, but the real Vlad the Impaler was 11 years old at that time. And the geography? The location of the buildings don't match up. The costumes, Ottoman swords are completely wrong. And Mehmed II, the future conqueror of Constatinople was also 10 years old at that time, but he magically grew up I guess. When Ottoman characters speak Turkish, it sounds like my French students who've just started learning the language. How cringy is that, like, really, could they at least not find the actors proper dialect coaches so that they could be a bit more convincing while pronouncing these two sentences?\n\nIf they think they can sell trash to the audience and not respect them, long live paid streaming channels. We don't have a dime to pay for a two hour long idiocracy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":184050,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Dallas. The Young and the Restless.  The Dukes of Hazzard.  He-Man.  The Greatest American Hero.  Airwolf.  Knight Rider.\n\nIn 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they did not commit.  They promptly escaped a maximum security stockade into the Los Angeles Underground.  Today, still wanted by the government, they exist as soldiers of fortune.  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...\n\nThe A-Team.\n\nWith a script any eight year old would love, the four members of the A-Team went off every week to somewhere in America to help someone who couldn't find help anywhere else.  They battled impossible odds (with impossible storylines) and managed to stay one step ahead of the law.  They were always predictable, heroic, and fun.  God bless the eighties, and long live TV Land.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35564,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"1983-01-23","keywords":"gmc vandura,cult tv,good versus evil,mercenary,hero for hire","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000577/","name":"George Peppard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001558/","name":"Mr. T","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776239/","name":"Dwight Schultz"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004798/","name":"Stephen J.

He's a surgeon from sophisticated, worldly London who moves to (fictional) Portwenn on the coast of Cornwall because he suddenly becomes ill at the sight of blood. This is not a good omen for a surgeon. He quits to become a general practitioner and he's satisfied, thanks very much, with checkups, prescriptions and referrals.\n\nThe foul-mannered, blunt-spoken Doc smugly considers himself above the crowd, but he soon learns he is really BELOW the crowd, out of step with Portwenn's eccentricities, value systems and peculiar burghers, who make the mere lunatics of London look normal by comparison.\n\nMartin Clunes is terrific in the lead role. He is a tall, charismatic and not exactly handsome actor who looks like he would be more comfortable playing cops and heavies. He is, instead, a consummate comic actor. His facial and physical comedy, his frequent bouts of exasperation and bewilderment, are things to behold. (Note: some wags have compared him to 'House,' from the popular TV drama of the same name. House is played by Hugh Laurie, another splendid Brit, and that's about where the comparison begins and ends. They are two very different characters in two very different shows.)\n\nPortwenn's local population, with its twisted logic that somehow makes perfect sense, is represented through the tour-de-force acting of supporting players: Bert (Ian McNeice, who always dazzles playing offbeat, world-weary philosophical characters); Louise (the charming and beautiful Caroline Catz), who either loves Martin or wants to kill him; corn-rowed Elaine (lovely Lucy Punch) as the ditzy assistant with her own set of secretarial ethics; and Doc's Aunt Joan (the great Stephanie Cole, who has been delighting audiences since the 1960s).\n\nDominic Minghella, he of the Minghella mob of talented artists (brother Anthony directed 'The English Patient'), is the brains behind this brilliant controlled chaos.\n\nDon't miss this program. TV shows that are both funny AND intelligent are the rarest of TV fare.\n\nAnd a fast footnote: let us all bow our heads and pray that Hollywood doesn't try to remake this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The 85th XTF is the 75th Exploitation Task Force. CWO Miller is CWO Gonzalez. The reporter is, of course, Judith Miller, the New York Times (not WSJ) reporter who sold out to the Bush administration to get bylines. She used her position as shill for Rummy to keep MET Alpha in Baghdad, chasing their tails while American soldiers died trying to find non-existent WMD, for the sole purpose of backing up Bush's lies. Miller's folio is full of information from Curveball (Magellan). The CIA, who knew Curveball was a liar, was also warning Miller. A perpetually smiling Ahmad Chalabi keeps popping up. He is no doubt thinking how fine it is for the US Army to hand him an entire country along with a treasury of several hundred million dollars.\n\nMiller is angry because he knows his intelligence is bogus, the CIA has told him that much, even though the Army vouches for it, and tells Miller to shut up and follow orders.\n\nThe Pentagon puke tries to bribe Miller with a job if he plays along, and offers a veiled threat if he doesn't.\n\nThe movie is history, and not a simple action adventure flick. It follows actual events very closely. Knowing the facts makes the movie much more fascinating.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134054,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-03-17","keywords":"political military conspiracy,interrogation by torture,american,female reporter,speech","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Zone: International Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi447415577","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4NDIwMzQyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4NDIwMzQyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Discovering covert and faulty intelligence causes a U.S. Army officer (Damon) to go rogue as he hunts for Weapons on Mass Destruction in an unstable region."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005042/","name":"Jason Isaacs"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339030/","name":"Paul Greengrass"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2418487/","name":"Rajiv Chandrasekaran"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The 85th XTF is the 75th Exploitation Task Force. CWO Miller is CWO Gonzalez. The reporter is, of course, Judith Miller, the New York Times (not WSJ) reporter who sold out to the Bush administration to get bylines. She used her position as shill for Rummy to keep MET Alpha in Baghdad, chasing their tails while American soldiers died trying to find non-existent WMD, for the sole purpose of backing up Bush's lies. Miller's folio is full of information from Curveball (Magellan). The CIA, who knew Curveball was a liar, was also warning Miller. A perpetually smiling Ahmad Chalabi keeps popping up. He is no doubt thinking how fine it is for the US Army to hand him an entire country along with a treasury of several hundred million dollars.\n\nMiller is angry because he knows his intelligence is bogus, the CIA has told him that much, even though the Army vouches for it, and tells Miller to shut up and follow orders.\n\nThe Pentagon puke tries to bribe Miller with a job if he plays along, and offers a veiled threat if he doesn't.\n\nThe movie is history, and not a simple action adventure flick. It follows actual events very closely. Knowing the facts makes the movie much more fascinating.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134054,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-03-17","keywords":"political military conspiracy,interrogation by torture,american,female reporter,speech","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Zone: International Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi447415577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4NDIwMzQyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjc4NDIwMzQyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0OTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Discovering covert and faulty intelligence causes a U.S. Army officer (Damon) to go rogue as he hunts for Weapons on Mass Destruction in an unstable region.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005042/","name":"Jason Isaacs","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339030/","name":"Paul Greengrass"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2418487/","name":"Rajiv Chandrasekaran"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Unfortunately in recent years, ER has declined in quality due to the departure of key characters, poor story lines and dull ideas, of which accounted for the decrease in viewing figures. The current crop of characters Neela, Luka, Abby, Pratt, Taggart and Barnett don't hold a candle to the experienced old rear guard of Greene, Carter, Benton, Lewis, Hathaway and Ross. They, in particular, were the original, and arguably the best set of characters the show has had.\n\nThe earlier seasons of ER were great- those times were witty, exciting and a joy to behold for us viewers. Such a shame however that when the old characters had left- or in the case of Mark Greene passed away- the writers of this drama were unable to fill that void with their newer, replacement characters, as well as good story lines and as such, the programme has suffered as a result. \n\nThere were a few story lines I didn't agree with; likewise for example, Mark Greene and Elizabeth Corday getting married together as a couple. I always had an inkling for Mark and Susan, of whom I felt had a lot more in common with each other and considering the history they had together as close friends and work colleagues they had a bond and chemistry that was like a match made in heaven. Also, a lot of ER fans preferred Mark to be with Susan, compared to those who liked Mark and Elizabeth. And so its such a shame that we never got to see Mark and Susan as a couple. There were also tragic and memorable story lines which are worth mentioning also that touched viewers hearts- Mark's brain tumour and his evitable death, Benton's son being mentally handicapped, Weaver coming to terms with her sexuality and coming out as a lesbian to her friends, work colleagues and family, and the consummation of Luka and Abbey and Ross and Carol's relationships. \n\nThe main problem with the ER though were the main characters of the earlier seasons who were on the show for a few series, and then suddenly they are written off. It doesn't matter how many new ideas, characters you introduce to the show because it is the original ideas, characters and realism of the show, of which worked so well in the first place that should be further developed. I wouldn't say that ER has jumped the shark, but it is certainly no longer the same show as it was back in 1994. ER is currently in its 14th season and whilst it is somewhat of an impressive feat, many of the original cast have gone and yet it can be argued that in reference to the current season the show has gradually become boring and stale, the longer it has gone on. \n\nAs the saying goes, all good things must come to an end- and ER perhaps is no exception. Perhaps now it is the time to lay this ghost to rest. As much as it is arguably the best and most successful medical drama in TV history, ER during the last few years has spiralled downhill; the writing isn't as good as it was and it has lost a lot of its spark, which made it the no#1 hit US drama around. Still, as mentioned earlier, it is still the best medical/hospital drama to ever grace our screens. As not even the classic St Elsewhere and Chicago Hope comes close to matching, rivalling or surpassing ER's accomplishments. \n\nBesides, this show will live long in TV history that's for sure and quite rightly so.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53466,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1994-09-19","keywords":"hospital,emergency room,sleeping,medical care,medical doctor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000381/","name":"Anthony Edwards","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000523/","name":"Julianna Margulies"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093758/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037310/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Er: Season 15","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2463087897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Er: Season 15"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As a sophomore, we find Veronica popular and happy. She is dating the most popular guy in school, Duncan, and is best friends with Duncan's sister- the wild Lily Kane. After Lily's brutal and highly publicized murder, Veronica loses her friends, her social status all because she choose to stick by her father who accused Lily Kane's own father, the rich and beloved Jake Kane.\n\nSeason 1 follows Veronica's life post Lily's violent murder. Veronica has become cynical and disheartened due to what she feels as betrayal by her closest friends. Overnight Veronica became the most hated girl in school. She formed a hard outer shell, cutting herself off from her emotions in order to handle all the events that occur after the murder, the taunts of classmates, and the current class war that's been waged through out her town.\n\nVeronica Mars is homage to the noir film genre of the 1950s with our main character being a high school teenager. The uses of color in scenes are key to understanding the story. Every aspect of the show is used to tell parts of the story from lighting to background prop placement and it all comes together to tell a beautiful story about death, betrayal, love, revenge and redemption.\n\nThe best thing about Mars, besides the character develop, plot twist, and witty dialogue, are the issues that Veronica Mars faces on a daily bases. Including murder, rape, teen pregnancy, gang violence, reports on abuse, and drug trafficking. It also tackles the normal high school issues all teens face like peer pressure, cliques, and gossip but in a smart way. The story lines are tasteful and believable; the writers did a great job avoiding the normal camp and clichés found in a lot of teen shows.\n\nVeronica Mars is hands down the best show ever to be featured on UPN/CW, and possible network TV in general. It is defiantly worth your time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69119,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2004-09-22","keywords":"female protagonist,internal monologue,murder of best friend,bus accident,female detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068338/","name":"Kristen Bell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230655/","name":"Jason Dohring","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170186/","name":"Enrico Colantoni"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020047/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017673/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0175100/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859432/","name":"Rob Thomas"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1849539609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Y2U5NWEtMGVhZC00ZTM4LTgzNzUtYTgxM2I1MDY0NTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI0Y2U5NWEtMGVhZC00ZTM4LTgzNzUtYTgxM2I1MDY0NTkzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Spring breakers are getting murdered in Neptune, thereby decimating the seaside town's tourist industry.
