This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15651,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The common link between CM &amp; CSI is that the question of "How?" is always more interesting.\n\nThe only difference: CSI centers around physical evidence gathering &amp; collecting the pieces to solve a puzzle.\n\nCriminal Minds involves more psychology &amp; sociology. We, as viewers, want to know what makes someone tick as a way to prevent crimes from occurring again.\n\nAnother reason why I enjoy this showed so much is how the characters put their expertise in play to solve some of the most twisted people around.\n\nAs casting is concerned: Patinkin is perfect as Jason Gideon. If you think about it, he's more like a professor citing famous lines from Einstein, Faulkner, etc.\n\nWhen I first read those lines, it didn't make sense at first, but as you watch each episode , the lines that Gideon cites has more meaning to it.\n\nFor example: Einstein: "Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world." Gideon is saying that the human mind is the deadliest weapon of all, &amp; we are capable of anything &amp; everything of achieving all kinds of possibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Criminal Minds is the kind the of show that anyone can enjoy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":167962,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So, on a whim, I tried out "Criminal Minds". I have never made a better TV decision.\n\nCriminal Minds is a psychological thriller that keeps your undivided attention. Like Law &amp; Order, no one character gets the direct star treatment. I have seen seven episodes, and I still do not have a favorite character (which is highly unusual for me). I love them all. Every single week, this is the only show I can hardly wait for.\n\nIf you like plots that keep you thinking and guessing while having plenty of physical and mention action, this show is definitely for you.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":173852,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

On Wednesday nights, I use to watch "The West Wing", but then that moved to Sunday. I started to watch "Head Cases", but to my great disappointment (though not surprise) that was cancelled. So, on a whim, I tried out "Criminal Minds". I have never made a better TV decision.\n\nCriminal Minds is a psychological thriller that keeps your undivided attention. Like Law &amp; Order, no one character gets the direct star treatment. I have seen seven episodes, and I still do not have a favorite character (which is highly unusual for me). I love them all. Every single week, this is the only show I can hardly wait for.\n\nIf you like plots that keep you thinking and guessing while having plenty of physical and mention action, this show is definitely for you.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":173852,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

The villains are not the Germans but the French people themselves. The real horror is not in the big scenes of torture but the ordinariness of the concierge cheerfully denouncing people in her own building. The French are still living today with the guilt of all that and this film is one of the rare examples of a frank look at this from the inside. I called it a "worthy" film which carries the film-makers problem of telling a tough story but still needing to seduce an audience into the cinema. The Picture House had a very small audience when I saw it tonight.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3168,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2009-09-16","keywords":"female full frontal nudity,female frontal nudity,circumcision,world war two,underground resistance","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Army of Crime","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1601634841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTY1OTQyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTY1OTQyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Paris 1941.

The villains are not the Germans but the French people themselves. The real horror is not in the big scenes of torture but the ordinariness of the concierge cheerfully denouncing people in her own building. The French are still living today with the guilt of all that and this film is one of the rare examples of a frank look at this from the inside. I called it a "worthy" film which carries the film-makers problem of telling a tough story but still needing to seduce an audience into the cinema. The Picture House had a very small audience when I saw it tonight.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3168,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2009-09-16","keywords":"female full frontal nudity,female frontal nudity,circumcision,world war two,underground resistance","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Army of Crime","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1601634841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTY1OTQyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MTY1OTQyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Paris 1941.

Not the political point of view here, but only human, very close to real characters depiction. Not bloody scenes, only suggested for the viewer.

The film itself is just a small look at the many lives lost trying to capture and secure this small village.\n\nThe film does a fine job of not shying away from the brutal and sadistic nature of the Germans to secure victory (massacring and raping civilians) and then systematically wiping out opposing forces.\n\nThe film also does a fine job of making it known that some of the biggest hurdles the Russian army faced in the war was from Soviet leadership!\n\nThe bureaucracy and stupidity of the Soviets cost many great and brave men their lives.

I almost wanted to spit into the face of the commanders wasting he lives of these brave soldiers; that's just how engrossing the film had become.\n\nBut what's more is that all of this feels authentic. Kopylov makes the battles feel grounded and realistic for the most part, and some soldiers suffer shell shock, PTSD, delirium and panic attacks, just as you would expect under those conditions. The violence is also fairly visceral and realistic; the special effects team make use of both squibbing and CGI, so while those of you who may hate the look of CGI blood, there is still some squibbing effects that help highlight the realism of the gun battles.\n\nOverall, it's a fascinating watch. Of course it's not as over-the-top and action-packed as T-34, but it is very similar to Kim Druzhinin and Andrey Shalopa's tightly hewn war-thriller, Panfilov's 28.

But somehow the power and tragedy of Wilde's story comes through all the gilding of the script, peppered with some of Wilde's wiser quotes, well-placed, naturally, in the text. There is nothing preachy or moralistic which is a relief, compared to the highly politicized scripts being written since this film was made.\n\nIt is interesting to note Nicholas Roeg as the camera operator.

Did like the structure, with a series of segments revolving around each season of the year (hence the title) and 'The Czech Year' does a very nice job with it.

The characters are detailed and full of life and the sceneries are colourful and atmospheric, old-fashioned yes but in an endearing way. The music is full of energy and beauty of tone, with a real feel for the period and a nostalgic Czech folklore vibe at times. The sung words don't ramble or get cheesy or schmaltzy. The characters are as alive in personality as they are in look and are engaging.\n\nWhile the story is basically a series of segments revolving around the seasons, this is handled cleverly and not in too episodic a way. Actually found myself learning a good deal about the beautiful to watch and interesting seasonal traditions and emotionally it's done beautifully.

It's not terrible, but don't expect to see much that's accurate about the Battle of Tarawa...except perhaps for the justification for choosing the Central Pacific route to Japan rather than going exclusively through Australia, New Guinea, and the Philippines. As in "Battle Cry," another film concerning the 2nd Marine Division prior to Tarawa, much of the film is set in New Zealand, but some of the purported Kiwis have accents from no farther west than California and hair styles no older than the late 1950s. If you've seen "Sands of Iwo Jima," you'll recognize much of the battle and beach footage, just stuck into this movie in between dialogue scenes in order to avoid having to pay to stage it again, I guess. Some accurate, some inaccurate combat film is inserted; as for the latter, amphibious tanks and vehicles with Army markings spoil the mood if you're trying to get a feel for the real Tarawa, as do broad, sandy beaches and lush, intact vegetation. The hatred between the main characters is well done, and the villain is a good mix of hero and coward. The trope of the woman burned badly by losing a husband at war and determined never to fall in love again is on full display (as in "Battle Cry" and "The Americanization of Emily").","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1958-11-02","keywords":"explosion,hand grenade,rifle,m1 rifle,u.s. marines","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558663/","name":"Kerwin Mathews"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011105/","name":"Julie Adams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200645/","name":"Ray Danton"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0920862/","name":"Paul Wendkos"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072431/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0671766/","name":"Richard Alan Simmons"}],"duration":"PT1H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's not terrible, but don't expect to see much that's accurate about the Battle of Tarawa...except perhaps for the justification for choosing the Central Pacific route to Japan rather than going exclusively through Australia, New Guinea, and the Philippines. As in "Battle Cry," another film concerning the 2nd Marine Division prior to Tarawa, much of the film is set in New Zealand, but some of the purported Kiwis have accents from no farther west than California and hair styles no older than the late 1950s. If you've seen "Sands of Iwo Jima," you'll recognize much of the battle and beach footage, just stuck into this movie in between dialogue scenes in order to avoid having to pay to stage it again, I guess. Some accurate, some inaccurate combat film is inserted; as for the latter, amphibious tanks and vehicles with Army markings spoil the mood if you're trying to get a feel for the real Tarawa, as do broad, sandy beaches and lush, intact vegetation. The hatred between the main characters is well done, and the villain is a good mix of hero and coward. The trope of the woman burned badly by losing a husband at war and determined never to fall in love again is on full display (as in "Battle Cry" and "The Americanization of Emily").","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1958-11-02","keywords":"explosion,hand grenade,rifle,m1 rifle,u.s. marines","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558663/","name":"Kerwin Mathews","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011105/","name":"Julie Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200645/","name":"Ray Danton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0920862/","name":"Paul Wendkos"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072431/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0671766/","name":"Richard Alan Simmons"],"duration":"PT1H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Certainly one of the most original, challenging and bleakest films ever made and to have come from a British film-maker, albeit an iconoclastic one, makes the achievement all the more remarkable. While I do think that comparisons to its contemporary PSYCHO (1960) are a bit tenuous, it has to be said that both films can be thought of as belonging to the horror genre  in fact, PEEPING TOM was the third British "slasher" movie in a row, following HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM (1959) and CIRCUS OF HORRORS (1960) - but can also lay claim to being a very dark sort of black comedy. Besides, both films feature dysfunctional, immature, adult male protagonists haunted by a terrible upbringing which vents itself in a series of murders. Furthermore, while both films have been harshly reviled by critics when first released, in time, they have had their reputations make a complete about face and nowadays are numbered among their respective directors' unassailable masterpieces!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33172,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1960-05-16","keywords":"serial killer,filmmaking,voyeurism,pornography,peeping tom","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Peeping Tom","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3348824345","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRhNTE1NTMtMWFkMi00NzVmLWExZjAtMzMyNjI4NTYyNTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRhNTE1NTMtMWFkMi00NzVmLWExZjAtMzMyNjI4NTYyNTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Peeping Tom"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003337/","name":"Karlheinz Böhm"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0557281/","name":"Anna Massey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0790452/","name":"Moira Shearer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003836/","name":"Michael Powell"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040391/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0548896/","name":"Leo Marks"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Certainly one of the most original, challenging and bleakest films ever made and to have come from a British film-maker, albeit an iconoclastic one, makes the achievement all the more remarkable. While I do think that comparisons to its contemporary PSYCHO (1960) are a bit tenuous, it has to be said that both films can be thought of as belonging to the horror genre  in fact, PEEPING TOM was the third British "slasher" movie in a row, following HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM (1959) and CIRCUS OF HORRORS (1960) - but can also lay claim to being a very dark sort of black comedy. Besides, both films feature dysfunctional, immature, adult male protagonists haunted by a terrible upbringing which vents itself in a series of murders. Furthermore, while both films have been harshly reviled by critics when first released, in time, they have had their reputations make a complete about face and nowadays are numbered among their respective directors' unassailable masterpieces!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":33172,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1960-05-16","keywords":"serial killer,filmmaking,voyeurism,pornography,peeping tom","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Peeping Tom","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3348824345","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRhNTE1NTMtMWFkMi00NzVmLWExZjAtMzMyNjI4NTYyNTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzRhNTE1NTMtMWFkMi00NzVmLWExZjAtMzMyNjI4NTYyNTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Peeping Tom","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003337/","name":"Karlheinz Böhm","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0557281/","name":"Anna Massey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0790452/","name":"Moira Shearer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003836/","name":"Michael Powell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040391/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0548896/","name":"Leo Marks"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He's nowadays as sheriff , Marshal Chris Adams , who turns down a friend's request to help stop the depredations of a band of Mexican bandits , but then his spouse (Mariette Hartley) has been kidnapped by a gang . When his wife is abducted by bank thieves and his friend is murdered capturing the last outlaw , Chris feels obligated to take up his partner's cause . Then Chris along with a journalist (Michael Callan) set off in pursuit bandit gunfighters (Gary Busey among them) , as he recruits five prisoners to track down the desperadoes . Besides , Chris helping his buddy (Ralph Waite) must free a Mexican village (inhabited by women as Stefanie Powers , among others) besieged by nasty outlaws who are devastating the small location . Lee van Cleef is decided to take a group of prisoners and strike a blow against the Mexican bandits . He goes to Tucson Territorial Prison where a bunch of misfits , murderers , robbers , rapists and other prisoners (with a TV star-studded cast such as Pedro Armendariz , Luke Askew, William Lucking, Ed Lauter, and James B. Sikking ) get a chance to redeem themselves . As Chris recruits various Magnificent Men and once again defending hapless people from their oppressors . As a brand of new seven , doing their number , they put their lives on the line and let it ride . \n\nThe last in the original series of four ¨The Magnificent Seven¨ movies , here Lee Van Cleef as Chris , substituting Yul Brynner , who played the role in two occasions , and one performed by George Kennedy . Yul Brynner insisted he would only make the sequels if Steve McQueen was not involved , McQueen felt the plot was too absurd and for this, and other reasons, was not interested anyway . Van Cleef as a two-fisted avenger sheriff is good as well as his role of ¨Sabata¨, meanwhile Yul Brynner left the Chris character for playing the ¨Cleef's Sabata¨ role in ¨Indio Black¨ . The story is similar to previous entries , adding ¨Dirty dozen¨ wake , including customary outlaw band formed by an eclectic gang with diverse speciality , as dynamite or guns . The film gets action Western , exciting riding, shootouts, it's funny and entertaining , although nothing new but displays a television style . The movie contains some moment of grisly violence and even touching on the relationships between the women and the Magnificent . This is a drab , inferior sequel from the original and enduringly popular ¨The magnificent seven¨ (John Sturges,1960) that is equally remake to ¨The seven samurais¨ (in fact , it was Yul Brynner who approached producer Walter Mirisch with the idea of doing a Western adaptation of Akira Kurosawa's classic) . After that , followed ¨The return of the seven¨(Burt Kennedy,1966), again with Brynner and ¨Guns of the magnificent seven¨ (Paul Wendkos,1969) with George Kennedy and continued with a TV series and a Television movie realized in 1998 . As always , breathtaking and memorable musical score by the great Elmer Berstein. Elmer , whose score for the series is one of the best-known ever composed , also wrote the soundtrack for the parody of this film, 'Three amigos'. Appropriate cinematography by expert cameraman Fred J. Koenekamp (Patton, The inferno towering, Papillon) . The motion picture was regularly directed by George McCowan , a usual TV episodes director (Charlie's Angels , Banacek , Cannon , Starsky and Hutch) .

    <title lang="fr">Les impures</title>
    <desc lang="fr">Anita: Directed by Torgny Wickman. With Christina Lindberg, Stellan Skarsgård, Danièle Vlaminck, Michel David. Anita is a girl of only teenage years, and while she has developed early physically, to a mature woman, she is emotionally struggling. Her relationship with her parents and her friends is very poor and she is regarded with contempt by the people around her, even by the men who so ruthlessly use her. During her troubles she meets Erik, a young psychology student. Gently and carefully he begins to dispel her psychological blocks. In the course of this treatment she reveals to him some of the shocking episodes of her previous experiences. Erik believes he has the solution to Anita's problems: to let her move into an artist's communal experiment, of which he is already a member. The common interest of this collective is largely the performing of classical music. Anita's presence in the collective, however, is regarded by some of the other girls as highly provocative. Anita's nymphomania is her means of protest against her parents, school, society and her own environment (her whole life situation). He therefore tries to get her to see clearly, and with some insight, the breadth of her psychological situation. Against the background of the intensive battle that Anita carries on with the self-destructive drives within her, grows the depth of feeling that bind her and Erik together. She is no longer simply a "case" for him. Anita discovers that Erik is the one man whom she both wants to, and can, remain with." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0069718/","name":"Anita","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUyMjcyOWQtODc5My00OWNiLTg3Y2UtYzZjOTlhMjYzOTJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDEwMDg3Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Anita is a girl of only teenage years, and while she has developed early physically, to a mature woman, she is emotionally struggling.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 0069718, Title: Anita, 
 --- Description: Anita: Directed by Torgny Wickman. With Christina Lindberg, Stellan Skarsgård, Danièle Vlaminck, Michel David. Anita is a girl of only teenage years, and while she has developed early physically, to a mature woman, she is emotionally struggling. Her relationship with her parents and her friends is very poor and she is regarded with contempt by the people around her, even by the men who so ruthlessly use her. During her troubles she meets Erik, a young psychology student. Gently and carefully he begins to dispel her psychological blocks. In the course of this treatment she reveals to him some of the shocking episodes of her previous experiences. Erik believes he has the solution to Anita's problems: to let her move into an artist's communal experiment, of which he is already a member. The common interest of this collective is largely the performing of classical music. Anita's presence in the collective, however, is regarded by some of the other girls as highly provocative. Anita's nymphomania is her means of protest against her parents, school, society and her own environment (her whole life situation). He therefore tries to get her to see clearly, and with some insight, the breadth of her psychological situation. Against the background of the intensive battle that Anita carries on with the self-destructive drives within her, grows the depth of feeling that bind her and Erik together. She is no longer simply a "case" for him. Anita discovers that Erik is the one man whom she both wants to, and can, remain with." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0069718/","name":"Anita","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUyMjcyOWQtODc5My00OWNiLTg3Y2UtYzZjOTlhMjYzOTJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMDEwMDg3Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Anita is a girl of only teenage years, and while she has developed early physically, to a mature woman, she is emotionally struggling.

The first time I played the DVD I felt a strange sense of detachment as I tried to absorb what had been played out before me.\n\nKitano plays a detective with huge burdens on his shoulders. His wife, Miyuki) is dying from cancer, a trusted partner &amp; friend (Horibe) is in a wheelchair with nothing to occupy his mind other than to paint landscapes &amp; think about suicide now that his wife &amp; family have deserted him. And to cap it all during an undercover operation headed by Kitano a young detective (Tanaka) is mortally shot &amp; killed because of a blunder on Kitano's part.\n\nHaving been subsequently kicked out of the policeforce, Kitano has to cope not only with the loss his job (and income) but to come to terms with his guilt regarding the dead detective, Tanaka, his emotional feelings &amp; absent love for Miyuki as she sees out her last few weeks. And finally, Kitano has a great deal of sympathy &amp; loyalty to his former partner &amp; friend crippled in a wheelchair.\n\nIn typical Kitano fashion he decides to rob a bank, pay off his debts to the local Yakuza warlords and spend the rest of the money on his crippled friend, Horibe; Tanaka's young widow and Kitano's dying wife.\n\nBeing a big fan of Kitano I wasn't disappointed by the style of the movie. His directional trademarks are visible through most of his films: flowers, beach scenes, picturesque landscapes, beautiful &amp; haunting music (by the ever dependable Jo Hisaishi); face-to-camera shots and of course a sense of helplessness &amp; defeatism within the lead actors themselves.\n\nBut what I wasn't quite prepared for was the melodrama &amp; pathos the film revealed to me. Unlike most of his other "gangster/police" movies such as Brother, Sonatine &amp; Violent Cop, the violence seems secondary to the moving, sometimes harrowing scenes of Kitano &amp; Miyuki holidaying together, trying to relive some of their past love &amp; passion for each but only to find there is nothing but loss &amp; grief.\n\nKitano shows a great range of emotions in this film: from being a tough &amp; very unforgiving man with his dealings with the Yakuza (the violence is sharp, sudden &amp; very graphic). While at other times he is a man totally lost in a world of sorrow &amp; pity, a man who finds it hard to grieve, to own up to his mistakes &amp; guilt, a man who only now realises how much he will miss his wife after spending so many years staying away &amp; not appreciating her needs whilst doing his job in the police.\n\nThe ending is absolutely gut-wrenching, but to be honest it was of no real surprise since there are similar outcomes in most of Kitano's films, especially Violent Cop &amp; Sonatine.\n\nThe cinematography is absolutely outstanding, coupled with the haunting score of Jo Hisaishi (who also did the score for my favourite Kitano film, Sonatine). Kitano's direction is also beautifully paced with very tight editing &amp; not a single shot is wasted.\n\nThe acting as well, is top drawer. Nothing needs to be said about Kitano's performance because it is that good. But the support from Kayoko Kishimoto (Miyuki), Ren Osugi (Horibe) &amp; Yûko Daike (Tanaka's widow) is truly excellent and never weighs the movie down with too much manufactured &amp; false melodrama so typical of Hollywood (especially movies starring Robin Williams).\n\nAs I said at the beginning of this review I had to see this film at least three times before I felt compelled to write about it, such is the power &amp; strength within this film. Kitano's humanity is very redeeming  &amp; reveals to our Western eyes the true values of Japanese tradition &amp; family relationships, especially with regards loyalty, friendship, love &amp; coming to terms with one's guilt.\n\nI recommend this film to anyone who takes an interest in movies of this kind. It may appear to drag at times, and some of the shots seems uneven &amp; redundant on first viewing. But give it a chance because after about the second or third view more &amp; more of the film's inner strengths will brim to the surface leaving you aghast &amp; begging for more.\n\n*****/*****","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28974,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"genre":["Crime","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-01-24","keywords":"police,illness,leukemia,grief,cynicism","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001429/","name":"Takeshi Kitano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457229/","name":"Kayoko Kishimoto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652592/","name":"Ren Ôsugi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001429/","name":"Takeshi Kitano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080697/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046382/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0100459/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001429/","name":"Takeshi Kitano"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Kitano's humanity is very redeeming  &amp; reveals to our Western eyes the true values of Japanese tradition &amp; family relationships, especially with regards loyalty, friendship, love &amp; coming to terms with one's guilt.\n\nI recommend this film to anyone who takes an interest in movies of this kind. It may appear to drag at times, and some of the shots seems uneven &amp; redundant on first viewing. But give it a chance because after about the second or third view more &amp; more of the film's inner strengths will brim to the surface leaving you aghast &amp; begging for more.\n\n*****/*****","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28974,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"genre":["Crime","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-01-24","keywords":"police,illness,leukemia,grief,cynicism","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001429/","name":"Takeshi Kitano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457229/","name":"Kayoko Kishimoto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652592/","name":"Ren Ôsugi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001429/","name":"Takeshi Kitano"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080697/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046382/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0100459/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001429/","name":"Takeshi Kitano"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The settings are superbly created -- the green, grotto-like woodland where Irons and Streep meet in the Victorian world of the film, the murky streets of Lyme, Exeter, and London, and the interior of the lawyer's office, for example. The Victorian part of the film emerges from the dawning of the concept of abnormal psychology (just before Freud) and is really convincing. Streep shows us that her character cannot move on emotionally until she has worked out her own madness. That constitutes a remarkable and complex performance of insanity and self-awareness inhabiting a single psyche. She earns the gentle movement out of the tunnel and onto the calm lake. The turbulence of the unconscious -- that threatening sea of which Irons has warned her -- has been subdued. Seems to me the flaw lies in the 'modern story' (as some here have pointed out). It may be that the Streep character is trying to find a subtext for her fictional heroine, but it looks like the old ennui, so that, while her lack of concern for the relationship is understandable, his obsession with it is not. Though the garden party at the end almost gets it there. Were we shown her decision there? If so, I missed it. I like the concept of the 'two endings' and their contrast, but the ending in the 20th century was a so what? The one in the 19th century was complex and included much of the pain that the relationship had caused both characters. A little more attention to the contemporary love affair -- to suggest that it was more than just a romp on location -- would have helped that dimension of the film per se and also suggested what the Victorian lovers had earned within their Hardyesque world.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12969,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1981-10-16","keywords":"love,actress,tragedy,victorian era,filmmaking","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The French Lieutenant's Woman","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1067779353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjhlNDJiMTgtNDhiOS00YWU1LTk0MzgtZWI0MjQ1NDY0ZDRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjhlNDJiMTgtNDhiOS00YWU1LTk0MzgtZWI0MjQ1NDY0ZDRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000658/","name":"Meryl Streep"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000460/","name":"Jeremy Irons"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0574436/","name":"Hilton McRae"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718554/","name":"Karel Reisz"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103522/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0288826/","name":"John Fowles"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0056217/","name":"Harold Pinter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718554/","name":"Karel Reisz"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The settings are superbly created -- the green, grotto-like woodland where Irons and Streep meet in the Victorian world of the film, the murky streets of Lyme, Exeter, and London, and the interior of the lawyer's office, for example. The Victorian part of the film emerges from the dawning of the concept of abnormal psychology (just before Freud) and is really convincing. Streep shows us that her character cannot move on emotionally until she has worked out her own madness. That constitutes a remarkable and complex performance of insanity and self-awareness inhabiting a single psyche. She earns the gentle movement out of the tunnel and onto the calm lake. The turbulence of the unconscious -- that threatening sea of which Irons has warned her -- has been subdued. Seems to me the flaw lies in the 'modern story' (as some here have pointed out). It may be that the Streep character is trying to find a subtext for her fictional heroine, but it looks like the old ennui, so that, while her lack of concern for the relationship is understandable, his obsession with it is not. Though the garden party at the end almost gets it there. Were we shown her decision there? If so, I missed it. I like the concept of the 'two endings' and their contrast, but the ending in the 20th century was a so what? The one in the 19th century was complex and included much of the pain that the relationship had caused both characters. A little more attention to the contemporary love affair -- to suggest that it was more than just a romp on location -- would have helped that dimension of the film per se and also suggested what the Victorian lovers had earned within their Hardyesque world.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12969,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1981-10-16","keywords":"love,actress,tragedy,victorian era,filmmaking","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The French Lieutenant's Woman","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1067779353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjhlNDJiMTgtNDhiOS00YWU1LTk0MzgtZWI0MjQ1NDY0ZDRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjhlNDJiMTgtNDhiOS00YWU1LTk0MzgtZWI0MjQ1NDY0ZDRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from MGM","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000658/","name":"Meryl Streep","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000460/","name":"Jeremy Irons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0574436/","name":"Hilton McRae"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718554/","name":"Karel Reisz"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103522/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0288826/","name":"John Fowles","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0056217/","name":"Harold Pinter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718554/","name":"Karel Reisz"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Mike tries to stay out of that style of living. He knows what he wants in life and the "proper" way to get it.

This leads to a brilliant sequence, near the end of the film, where Mike is old enough to be passed his quarter-life crisis while Adam is just approaching his. But one is at more of a cross-roads than the other.\n\nI am also assuming that Soderbergh has chosen to direct this just to do something different. Choosing interesting light effects and strange camera angles, just for fun I suppose. This is a genre that is not known for being inventive and I don't think much of his effort was necessary.

When they do so despite years of being recycled, it's usually thanks to talent. "Saw" director James Wan found something of promise in "Saw" writer Leigh Whannell's story "Insidious" and the same must've gone for stars Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. Horror films rarely get that infusion of talent, and as such, "Insidious" does not get lost in that dark dimension of forgettable horror.\n\nJosh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) Lambert have moved into a new home with their two young boys and infant girl. Like always, paranormal oddities occur in small doses here and there until one morning they find their son Dalton in a coma. A few months pass and they move Dalton back home. The freaky incidences increase and eventually Renai sees the ghosts. She convinces Josh to move them into a new home, but it gets worse, so they bring in a paranormal expert (Lin Shaye) who provides them with some shocking revelations about the state of their son.\n\nLike "Paranormal Activity" (a film thats producers have credits on this film unsurprisingly), the idea is to mount tension through paranormal phenomena and expert suspense. Wan provides a number of perfect angles and color to achieve the various moods. As much as you've been spooked this way by films before, you can't simply shirk the way the film creeps in — Wan won't have any of it. In fact, nothing here in terms of scare tactics will come as a revelation; many with a higher jumpiness tolerance will likely find it boring in many regards. No gore or horrific images to be found here — "Insidious" does it old school.\n\nOnce Shaye's character Elise and her two employees arrive on scene, the story mutates from paranormal suspense to other-worldly mystery. Elise explains what's going on — something that involves Dalton's soul being lost in a realm called The Further — and now they must rescue him.

When they do so despite years of being recycled, it's usually thanks to talent. "Saw" director James Wan found something of promise in "Saw" writer Leigh Whannell's story "Insidious" and the same must've gone for stars Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. Horror films rarely get that infusion of talent, and as such, "Insidious" does not get lost in that dark dimension of forgettable horror.\n\nJosh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) Lambert have moved into a new home with their two young boys and infant girl. Like always, paranormal oddities occur in small doses here and there until one morning they find their son Dalton in a coma. A few months pass and they move Dalton back home. The freaky incidences increase and eventually Renai sees the ghosts. She convinces Josh to move them into a new home, but it gets worse, so they bring in a paranormal expert (Lin Shaye) who provides them with some shocking revelations about the state of their son.\n\nLike "Paranormal Activity" (a film thats producers have credits on this film unsurprisingly), the idea is to mount tension through paranormal phenomena and expert suspense. Wan provides a number of perfect angles and color to achieve the various moods. As much as you've been spooked this way by films before, you can't simply shirk the way the film creeps in — Wan won't have any of it. In fact, nothing here in terms of scare tactics will come as a revelation; many with a higher jumpiness tolerance will likely find it boring in many regards. No gore or horrific images to be found here — "Insidious" does it old school.\n\nOnce Shaye's character Elise and her two employees arrive on scene, the story mutates from paranormal suspense to other-worldly mystery. Elise explains what's going on — something that involves Dalton's soul being lost in a realm called The Further — and now they must rescue him. Whannell constructs an interesting mythology here and the story goes from horror to more of a mystery/thriller with demonic elements. In a sense he borrows from science fiction in establishing the rules of what's going on. It's mostly interesting, but in many instances flat-out weird to the point that horror purists might not like it.\n\nThe best way to describe "Insidious" is first half "Paranormal Activity" and second half something akin to Sam Raimi's "Drag Me To Hell," which equates to a nice balance between self-seriousness and horror fun. The "X" factor would be the performances. Byrne keeps Renai from becoming an obnoxious scaredy cat as her role's importance dwindles in the latter half of the film, in which time she still keeps Renai relevant. Wilson's character is no typical over- macho father figure or anything. Together they provide an unusual boost for horror, which typically strives for random faces with questionable experience.\n\nIn general, "Insidious" possesses a professionalism not often seen in the genre; most horror films go for cheap across the board from the budget to the talent to the thrills.

When they do so despite years of being recycled, it's usually thanks to talent. "Saw" director James Wan found something of promise in "Saw" writer Leigh Whannell's story "Insidious" and the same must've gone for stars Rose Byrne and Patrick Wilson. Horror films rarely get that infusion of talent, and as such, "Insidious" does not get lost in that dark dimension of forgettable horror.\n\nJosh (Wilson) and Renai (Byrne) Lambert have moved into a new home with their two young boys and infant girl. Like always, paranormal oddities occur in small doses here and there until one morning they find their son Dalton in a coma. A few months pass and they move Dalton back home. The freaky incidences increase and eventually Renai sees the ghosts. She convinces Josh to move them into a new home, but it gets worse, so they bring in a paranormal expert (Lin Shaye) who provides them with some shocking revelations about the state of their son.\n\nLike "Paranormal Activity" (a film thats producers have credits on this film unsurprisingly), the idea is to mount tension through paranormal phenomena and expert suspense. Wan provides a number of perfect angles and color to achieve the various moods. As much as you've been spooked this way by films before, you can't simply shirk the way the film creeps in — Wan won't have any of it. In fact, nothing here in terms of scare tactics will come as a revelation; many with a higher jumpiness tolerance will likely find it boring in many regards. No gore or horrific images to be found here — "Insidious" does it old school.\n\nOnce Shaye's character Elise and her two employees arrive on scene, the story mutates from paranormal suspense to other-worldly mystery. Elise explains what's going on — something that involves Dalton's soul being lost in a realm called The Further — and now they must rescue him. Whannell constructs an interesting mythology here and the story goes from horror to more of a mystery/thriller with demonic elements. In a sense he borrows from science fiction in establishing the rules of what's going on. It's mostly interesting, but in many instances flat-out weird to the point that horror purists might not like it.\n\nThe best way to describe "Insidious" is first half "Paranormal Activity" and second half something akin to Sam Raimi's "Drag Me To Hell," which equates to a nice balance between self-seriousness and horror fun. The "X" factor would be the performances. Byrne keeps Renai from becoming an obnoxious scaredy cat as her role's importance dwindles in the latter half of the film, in which time she still keeps Renai relevant. Wilson's character is no typical over- macho father figure or anything. Together they provide an unusual boost for horror, which typically strives for random faces with questionable experience.\n\nIn general, "Insidious" possesses a professionalism not often seen in the genre; most horror films go for cheap across the board from the budget to the talent to the thrills. Although "Insidious" lacks distinctiveness in terms of story, not an ounce of it can be perceived as immature or hollow. What a rare (but not unusual) treat.\n\n~Steven C\n\nVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":287142,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The apathy of the characters was matched by my apathy for this film.\n\nAny attempts at building suspense or atmosphere fail with long lingering shots making up the bulk of this film.

Few movies are like this, and it remains (many viewings later) one of my top 10 films of all time.\n\nThe plot is presented well in other reviews here, so I will not repeat it or comment further.  Of the film itself I would only add that it is without doubt the most mature and satisfying of David Lynch's works - in many ways it is the final, polished jewel carved from the rough and ugly (but fascinating) diamond of Eraserhead, with the self-conscious artiness and juvenile qualities of the earlier film distilled into a potent and poignant statement on the human condition.\n\nSome critics have dismissed The Elephant Man as an exercise in emotional manipulation, however I believe this completely misses the point.  All films are manipulative to some degree, but it is a manipulation in which we as an audience engage by consent.  The Elephant Man will stand the final test and it will be appreciated fully by future audiences, in much the same way as Citizen Kane had to wait for some decades until audiences  were able to fully comprehend its greatness."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":229675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"1980-10-10","keywords":"physical deformity,human exploitation,exploitation,dignity,sideshow","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1763229209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjYyMzMwMmMtZTI1My00NGFmLTllMmEtNTRjOGFmNzJmZGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjYyMzMwMmMtZTI1My00NGFmLTllMmEtNTRjOGFmNzJmZGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000457/","name":"John Hurt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000843/","name":"Anne Bancroft"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000186/","name":"David Lynch"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000858/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0212246/","name":"Christopher De Vore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075015/","name":"Eric Bergren"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000186/","name":"David Lynch"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Few movies are like this, and it remains (many viewings later) one of my top 10 films of all time.\n\nThe plot is presented well in other reviews here, so I will not repeat it or comment further.  Of the film itself I would only add that it is without doubt the most mature and satisfying of David Lynch's works - in many ways it is the final, polished jewel carved from the rough and ugly (but fascinating) diamond of Eraserhead, with the self-conscious artiness and juvenile qualities of the earlier film distilled into a potent and poignant statement on the human condition.\n\nSome critics have dismissed The Elephant Man as an exercise in emotional manipulation, however I believe this completely misses the point.  All films are manipulative to some degree, but it is a manipulation in which we as an audience engage by consent.  The Elephant Man will stand the final test and it will be appreciated fully by future audiences, in much the same way as Citizen Kane had to wait for some decades until audiences  were able to fully comprehend its greatness.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":229675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"1980-10-10","keywords":"physical deformity,human exploitation,exploitation,dignity,sideshow","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1763229209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjYyMzMwMmMtZTI1My00NGFmLTllMmEtNTRjOGFmNzJmZGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjYyMzMwMmMtZTI1My00NGFmLTllMmEtNTRjOGFmNzJmZGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000457/","name":"John Hurt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000843/","name":"Anne Bancroft"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000186/","name":"David Lynch"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000858/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0212246/","name":"Christopher De Vore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075015/","name":"Eric Bergren","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000186/","name":"David Lynch"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

All of these films share the same basic formula of 4 or 5 seemingly unrelated stories that ultimately converge on a particular holiday in a big city. If you're familiar with Gary Marshall's illustrious career including iconic films like "Pretty Woman" (1990) and going all the way back to 70s TV with "Happy Days" and "Laverne &amp; Shirley" (and yes! He is married to Penny "Laverne" Marshall who makes a brief but funny cameo in this movie), then you know basically what to expect: good clean fun that won't necessarily change your life or fix the ozone layer, but it's great entertainment for a night. Eeeh slightly on the sappy/predictable side, but heck, what do you expect from a PG-13 movie?\n\nAs with Marshall's other films, the appeal lies largely in a superstar studded cast. Robert De Niro, Halle Berry, Ashton Kutcher, Hilary Swank, Sarah Jessica Parker, Jon Bon Jovi (wait... Who?), and buckets of cameos like James Belushi, Ludicrous (argh, IMDb's auto spell checker keeps messing up the spelling), Cary Elwes and Alyssa Milano whose scene actually got cut. However my biggest criticism is that, by splitting the screen time between so many show-stealers in so many little segments, nobody really gets a chance to shine. And for example you may be a little annoyed that a master thespian like Robert De Niro is on screen for only a combined 10 minutes, if even that. Thus, the big names come across as somewhat gimmicky.\n\nMy next biggest criticism is that the jokes and gags weren't that great. At times it felt like the movie was trying too hard to make a lukewarm joke work. You know, like when you start to tell a lame joke at the office water cooler, then in your mind you realize how lame it is, so you try to dramatize it with flourishes and big arm gestures. Yeah because that always works. Not that I do that. Much.\n\nBut then you realize that this really is a tale in the tradition of 70s sitcom, predictable, slightly flat, but with its own distinct style that might make you catch yourself grinning.\n\nGary, if you're out there reading this (yeah because award winning Hollywood directors like to waste their time trolling internet movie sites), I'd like to suggest that the darker, edgier segments work best. For example Ashton Kutcher (whom I normally don't care for) played an excellent role as a misanthropic hipster poseur, sort of a modern day scrooge, who spends his time tearing down party decorations in his apartment building. Most of the other segments were a bit too chipper, and thus they suffered from lack of humorous irony, which, ask Mel Brooks, is important in comedy. Of course, the most important thing in comedy is... well... (insert big arm gesture) ...you know... like... timing."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was co-written and directed by Stéphane Brizé. \n\nIn a short introduction before the film began, the presenter pointed out the the actual translation of the French title would be "The Law of the Market." Both titles tell us something about the plot of the movie. "The Measure of a Man" emphasizes the basic humanity of the protagonist. "The Law of the Market" emphasizes the basic inhumanity of the marketplace-driven society in which he lives.\n\nVincent Lindon plays Thierry Taugourdeau, who has lost his skilled labor job because of a factory closure. (Other displaced workers want to sue the company for pulling out of France to go elsewhere. Apparently, this isn't legal if the company is making a profit in France. However, Thierry isn't interested.)\n\nThierry is accustomed to getting a good salary in a respected job. As the film opens, we learn that he has taken a three-month course in order to learn how to be a crane operator. He informs the government employment counselor that the course was worthless. Companies will only employ crane operators that are already experienced construction workers. Why did they advise him to take a course that couldn't lead to employment?\n\nThe film continues in the same vein. Thierry truly wants to work to support himself, his wife, and his son with cerebral palsy. (The son is portrayed by Matthieu Schaller, who does indeed have cerebral palsy.)\n\nWe follow Thierry from frustration to frustration as nothing he does brings him employment. Finally, he obtains employment, and that is where the measure of a man begins.\n\nThis is a fascinating--but painful--movie to watch. We're accustomed to unhappy stories in which the protagonists are down-and-out, and the situation is hopeless. This plot doesn't fit into that mold. Thierry has had a comfortable, middle-class life. He's intelligent and resourceful. Even so, he can't counter the forces of society that tell him that he and his family have to move down a notch--or more--in order to survive.\n\nVincent Lindon is brilliant in this role. We can identify with him and it is not a comfortable feeling. Lindon won the Best Actor award at Cannes for this portrayal, and I'm not surprised. It's worth seeing this film just for an opportunity to watch a superb actor succeeding in a difficult role.\n\nWe saw this film in the excellent Dryden Theatre in Rochester's George Eastman Museum. It was shown a part of the outstanding Rochester Labor Film Series. \n\nFor reasons I don't understand, this movie has a dismal IMDb rating of 6.8. Possibly, reviewers found it simply too depressing. Yes, it's depressing, but it reflects reality, and I think it's definitely worth seeking out. It's available on DVD and Blu-Ray. It's too important a film to miss.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5928,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-05-19","keywords":"supermarket,working class,france,trailer camp,campground","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"La loi du marché (The Measure of a Man)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2223026201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MDMzMTc2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA3MTQ2NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MDMzMTc2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA3MTQ2NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Full trailer for La loi du marché (The Measure of a Man) in French."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0512071/","name":"Vincent Lindon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7379140/","name":"Karine de Mirbeck"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7379141/","name":"Matthieu Schaller"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0110300/","name":"Stéphane Brizé"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085679/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0110300/","name":"Stéphane Brizé"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0329825/","name":"Olivier Gorce"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

We can identify with him and it is not a comfortable feeling. Lindon won the Best Actor award at Cannes for this portrayal, and I'm not surprised. It's worth seeing this film just for an opportunity to watch a superb actor succeeding in a difficult role.\n\nWe saw this film in the excellent Dryden Theatre in Rochester's George Eastman Museum. It was shown a part of the outstanding Rochester Labor Film Series. \n\nFor reasons I don't understand, this movie has a dismal IMDb rating of 6.8. Possibly, reviewers found it simply too depressing. Yes, it's depressing, but it reflects reality, and I think it's definitely worth seeking out. It's available on DVD and Blu-Ray. It's too important a film to miss.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5928,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-05-19","keywords":"supermarket,working class,france,trailer camp,campground","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"La loi du marché (The Measure of a Man)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2223026201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MDMzMTc2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA3MTQ2NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk4MDMzMTc2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA3MTQ2NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Full trailer for La loi du marché (The Measure of a Man) in French.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0512071/","name":"Vincent Lindon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7379140/","name":"Karine de Mirbeck","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7379141/","name":"Matthieu Schaller"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0110300/","name":"Stéphane Brizé"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085679/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0110300/","name":"Stéphane Brizé","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0329825/","name":"Olivier Gorce"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He is reaching out for a third Michelin star and anything less would end up getting burnt by his wrath.\n\nSo we know how recalcitrant chefs are. Seen enough Gordon Ramsay to reach that conclusion. Bradley as Adam Jones touches that nerve wrecking breakdown to achieve what he has planned to do. He shouts, despises, scorns and insults his crew to get their juices running. He doesn't care how evil he might look or sound while trying to get results. He is unaffected by emotions, reckless with his life but careful with the food he is preparing. If his preparation doesn't meet the standard in his head, he flings it away and doesn't even hold himself from bashing it to the wall. \n\nHe might be a man with a mission, but he is arrogant, mean and a heartless prick. He is also in a huge drug debt which gawks him from a distance, and occasionally batters him up good. He is trying hard to reach it, and there is always someone or something that messes him up and compels him to start at Ground Zero. \n\nWhat is quite interesting to watch is the brilliant presentation of its frames. The food shown in Burnt will at once make you hungry. There are great close up shots that will sizzle your palates. But everything disappears leaving you wanting for more. Also, there isn't one great recipe that is highlighted marvelously or shown being cooked proper which will bum foodies out. The story lacks substance which is sad. Screenplay of the flick is good. The score is kind of okay, but could have used some more depth. \n\nCooper fans are gonna love him in this new avatar. His acting is still very engaging. His dramatic bits are great to watch and Siena Miller complements him yet again quite beautifully. Daniel Bruhl plays Tony beautifully too. Emma Thompson has been given some marvelous lines, while Alicia Vikander has kind of a cameo in there. \n\nRemember the golden rule to truly enjoy anything: Don't compare!

She is single and has just called off a three-year relationship and professionally she runs a bakery, is very well-organized and plans to upgrade her business to a restaurant. When her friends schedule a blind date with Peter's best friend, TV sports director Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel), their encounter is a flop and Holly hates the reckless womanizer Messer. However, when Allison and Peter have a fatal car accident, the godparents Holly and Messer learn by the lawyer that they have been named the legal guardians of Peter and Allison's baby, Sophie, and have inherited their large house to raise the girl. Having in common only their love for Sophie, Holly and Messer have their lives turned upside-down and need to support each other to keep the girl with them and honor the wishes of their best friends.\n\n"Life as We Know It" is a pleasant romance, despite the tragedy and predictability of the story. I usually like the films of the gorgeous Katherine Heigl and the practically unknown Josh Duhamel is hilarious in the role of a wolf.

She is single and has just called off a three-year relationship and professionally she runs a bakery, is very well-organized and plans to upgrade her business to a restaurant. When her friends schedule a blind date with Peter's best friend, TV sports director Eric Messer (Josh Duhamel), their encounter is a flop and Holly hates the reckless womanizer Messer. However, when Allison and Peter have a fatal car accident, the godparents Holly and Messer learn by the lawyer that they have been named the legal guardians of Peter and Allison's baby, Sophie, and have inherited their large house to raise the girl. Having in common only their love for Sophie, Holly and Messer have their lives turned upside-down and need to support each other to keep the girl with them and honor the wishes of their best friends.\n\n"Life as We Know It" is a pleasant romance, despite the tragedy and predictability of the story. I usually like the films of the gorgeous Katherine Heigl and the practically unknown Josh Duhamel is hilarious in the role of a wolf. Their chemistry is awesome, but the babies Alexis, Brynn and Brooke Clagett steal the movie. I believe that everybody that is experienced father or mother will recall their first experiences as parents and will love the troubles of Holly and Messer.

We have all had that friend who falls head over heels for someone we know is not good for them. If we are a dutiful friend, we make every effort possible to open their eyes before it's too late. Sometimes they are simply too far gone to listen   and what follows is a roller-coaster of emotions, or even an outright train wreck. Writer/director (and sometimes actress) Maiwenn, who was once married to director Luc Besson, finds much to examine in the roller-coaster relationship of Georgio and Marie/Tony.\n\nThe story is viewed through the eyes (and recollections) of Marie/Tony played with exuberance by Emmanuelle Bercot. After a skiing "accident", Tony goes to a rehabilitation center to receive post-surgery treatment. While her knee is healing, she also spends her time self-analyzing a tumultuous and destructive relationship with her ex Georgio (Vincent Cassel). It's easy to see the parallels for her learning to walk again, while also learning to live again.\n\nTony is a successful criminal attorney and self-described "normal" woman. She falls hard for the exciting Georgio, a life-of-the-party type. Tony's brother Solal (Louis Garrel) and Georgio's suicidal ex Agnes (Chrystele Saint Louis Augustin) are both against this relationship, but it's challenging to stop the love bug when it hits this hard. The film acts as a blueprint of how relationships and falling in love can start strong, build to a crescendo, and then crash and burn.\n\nGeorgio has many childlike characteristics. He is fine when he gets his way, but explosive and manipulative at the drop of a hat. He is fully engaged in phase one which is filled with passion, lust, fun and excitement; however, once the everyday toil and maintenance of the relationship is required, his bi-polar personality becomes difficult to watch.\n\nAddiction plays a key role here. Georgio is addicted to freedom, partying, and drugs; Tony is addicted to the excitement and passion that he delivers to her "normal" life. There are some cinematically rare "real life" scenes scattered throughout, and none better than the couple's first time in bed, and a later dinner scene where Georgio's charm and manipulation skills are on full display as he puts Tony in a no-win situation.\n\nVincent Cassel has joined Mads Mikkelsen on my short list of actors that I will watch regardless of the project. His screen presence is powerful and emotionally-driven, and here he generates both admiration and disgust at varying times. We understand why Tony is in a "can't live with him, can't live without him" mode. Emmanuelle Bercot (also a writer and director for other films) manages to cover the full spectrum of emotions during the film, and she takes us along for the self-reflection.

He pulls off the quiet, but sturdy cowboy image with perfection.  Kristin Scott Thomas portrays Annie Maclean, a woman whose daughter's horse has been injured in an accident.  The same accident caused her daughter, Grace, portrayed by Scarlett Johansson,  to lose one of her legs.  She goes to Tom to get help for the "out of control" horse.

A washed out burnt down Chef has cleaned up, buffed his act up, and put himself together in an endeavour to pursue perfection. He is reaching out for a third Michelin star and anything less would end up getting burnt by his wrath.\n\nSo we know how recalcitrant chefs are. Seen enough Gordon Ramsay to reach that conclusion. Bradley as Adam Jones touches that nerve wrecking breakdown to achieve what he has planned to do. He shouts, despises, scorns and insults his crew to get their juices running. He doesn't care how evil he might look or sound while trying to get results. He is unaffected by emotions, reckless with his life but careful with the food he is preparing. If his preparation doesn't meet the standard in his head, he flings it away and doesn't even hold himself from bashing it to the wall. \n\nHe might be a man with a mission, but he is arrogant, mean and a heartless prick. He is also in a huge drug debt which gawks him from a distance, and occasionally batters him up good. He is trying hard to reach it, and there is always someone or something that messes him up and compels him to start at Ground Zero. \n\nWhat is quite interesting to watch is the brilliant presentation of its frames. The food shown in Burnt will at once make you hungry. There are great close up shots that will sizzle your palates. But everything disappears leaving you wanting for more. Also, there isn't one great recipe that is highlighted marvelously or shown being cooked proper which will bum foodies out. The story lacks substance which is sad. Screenplay of the flick is good. The score is kind of okay, but could have used some more depth. \n\nCooper fans are gonna love him in this new avatar. His acting is still very engaging. His dramatic bits are great to watch and Siena Miller complements him yet again quite beautifully. Daniel Bruhl plays Tony beautifully too. Emma Thompson has been given some marvelous lines, while Alicia Vikander has kind of a cameo in there. \n\nRemember the golden rule to truly enjoy anything: Don't compare! Burnt shouldn't be compared with other similar culinary movies in the library and you might relish it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":109190,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Wrong Trousers happens to be one of my favorite short animation pieces and although just because it's a Wallace &amp; Gromit film, doesn't mean that I'll love it, I went in expecting to be charmed.\n\nAnd I was.\n\nThe film was true Wallace &amp; Gromit in form and fashion, this time featuring Wallace &amp; Gromit as humane pest control operatives "Anti-Pesto." Again, featuring many cute Rube-Goldberg-type inventions, cheese, and menacing, but somewhat silly, villains, the film is full of things to adore.\n\nThere were a couple moments that threw me off, namely a couple of jokes that belong in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, but I suppose it will fly over the heads of the target youth audience. Actually, I haven't seen a General Audiences rated movie this enjoyable in a while, and minus those moments, this film is good clean fun.\n\nWallace &amp; Gromit's sense of humor is less the laugh-out-loud humor but more the grin-inducing chuckle-laden charming type, with some punny moments, and it works to great effect. In particular, Gromit is perhaps the best silent character in recent film history. Without saying nary a word or making a single sound, he manages to convey a great deal of emotion and comic excellence, which is quite impressive considering that Gromit is made entirely of clay.\n\nThe plot is simple and not particularly original, but I was surprised by the inventiveness by which Nick Park and company took a few old stories and refreshed them. I really can find no solid wrong with the film minus those unexpected moments of adult humor.\n\nHighly recommended. 8/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":129554,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-05-03","keywords":"dog,hunting,competition,pest control,giant vegetable","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3571515673","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4YzUxMjAtY2ZhMC00N2NmLWIyYjgtZGZhZTAzZmQ3ZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4YzUxMjAtY2ZhMC00N2NmLWIyYjgtZGZhZTAzZmQ3ZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0758608/","name":"Peter Sallis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000307/","name":"Helena Bonham Carter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000146/","name":"Ralph Fiennes"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101508/","name":"Steve Box"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0661910/","name":"Nick Park"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103531/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101508/","name":"Steve Box"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0661910/","name":"Nick Park"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123666/","name":"Mark Burton"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Wrong Trousers happens to be one of my favorite short animation pieces and although just because it's a Wallace &amp; Gromit film, doesn't mean that I'll love it, I went in expecting to be charmed.\n\nAnd I was.\n\nThe film was true Wallace &amp; Gromit in form and fashion, this time featuring Wallace &amp; Gromit as humane pest control operatives "Anti-Pesto." Again, featuring many cute Rube-Goldberg-type inventions, cheese, and menacing, but somewhat silly, villains, the film is full of things to adore.\n\nThere were a couple moments that threw me off, namely a couple of jokes that belong in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, but I suppose it will fly over the heads of the target youth audience. Actually, I haven't seen a General Audiences rated movie this enjoyable in a while, and minus those moments, this film is good clean fun.\n\nWallace &amp; Gromit's sense of humor is less the laugh-out-loud humor but more the grin-inducing chuckle-laden charming type, with some punny moments, and it works to great effect. In particular, Gromit is perhaps the best silent character in recent film history. Without saying nary a word or making a single sound, he manages to convey a great deal of emotion and comic excellence, which is quite impressive considering that Gromit is made entirely of clay.\n\nThe plot is simple and not particularly original, but I was surprised by the inventiveness by which Nick Park and company took a few old stories and refreshed them. I really can find no solid wrong with the film minus those unexpected moments of adult humor.\n\nHighly recommended. 8/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":129554,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-05-03","keywords":"dog,hunting,competition,pest control,giant vegetable","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wallace &amp; Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3571515673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4YzUxMjAtY2ZhMC00N2NmLWIyYjgtZGZhZTAzZmQ3ZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWE4YzUxMjAtY2ZhMC00N2NmLWIyYjgtZGZhZTAzZmQ3ZTRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0758608/","name":"Peter Sallis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000307/","name":"Helena Bonham Carter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000146/","name":"Ralph Fiennes"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101508/","name":"Steve Box","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0661910/","name":"Nick Park"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103531/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101508/","name":"Steve Box","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0661910/","name":"Nick Park","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123666/","name":"Mark Burton"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I was really impressed with this movie and would highly recommend it. It has very funny moments for both the kids and the adults, so it works for a family movie very well. Robin Williams did a terrific job as Vender, he was just a great addition and brought fun comedic relief. But the whole cast sounded like they had a lot of fun with this movie.

This is the story of a young girl named Elsa who was raised by a single mother (Isabelle) in the city. Isabelle and Elsa begin the film moving in next door to an elderly man who collects butterflies (Julien). Isabelle who "spends a lot of time with her friends" does not pay much attention to her daughter who walks home because her mother forgot to pick her up from school. After meeting her new neighbor, Elsa finds out about the butterflies and in short annoys Julien for a while. Julien receives a mystery package from a fellow entomologist. Julien sets out on his annual attempt to find a rare species of butterfly that he had once promised his son he would find (son dead) in the French country side, specifically a region known as Vercors. Elsa stows away in his car. After being discovered she convinces him to let her come to Vercors with him. They bond while hiking and camping until Julien, who is initially annoyed by Elsa, near the end of the film seems to have a grandfather-granddaughter relationship with her. Elsa falls in a well. The police arrest Julien. Elsa tells everyone it is cool. Isabelle starts paying attention to her child. Julien and Elsa are friends.

Add to that great dialogue, good acting and a great photography and you got a movie that should be on the top 20 list of anyone looking for real movies.\n\nThe fact that the underlying storyline has already been brought several times to the big screen, with the same dexterity or not, does not detract from the fact that this film combines all its elements in a mix that positions it above the crowd. Serrault's movies might not all have been of this quality, but in recent years he has certainly managed to bring us several movies where the humane aspect of his characters prevail.\n\nDo not start looking for logical explanations for certain elements of the movie, do not psychoanalyse it and try to find faults... this movie is just like life itself, sometimes logical, sometimes illogical, often random. Just watch, enjoy and get carried away by the witty dialogue. Despite all the adversities one might encounter, it's those little things - how insignificant they may be - that make it worthwhile and helps everyone become the unique individuals we are.\n\nThis is a sincere movie suitable for the whole family that manages to stay out of the tear-jerker or kiddy movie categories. Special mention also for the soundtrack! If you liked this you might also want to check out The Malabar Princess.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"butterfly,vercors,caterpillar,single mother,hiking","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1014479385","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3MTM1YjYtNTAzOS00ZDk2LWE3MDQtMWI3NjQ2YWY1NWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3MTM1YjYtNTAzOS00ZDk2LWE3MDQtMWI3NjQ2YWY1NWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785664/","name":"Michel Serrault"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1237271/","name":"Claire Bouanich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0226383/","name":"Nade Dieu"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003974/","name":"Philippe Muyl"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012976/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022162/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003974/","name":"Philippe Muyl"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Add to that great dialogue, good acting and a great photography and you got a movie that should be on the top 20 list of anyone looking for real movies.\n\nThe fact that the underlying storyline has already been brought several times to the big screen, with the same dexterity or not, does not detract from the fact that this film combines all its elements in a mix that positions it above the crowd. Serrault's movies might not all have been of this quality, but in recent years he has certainly managed to bring us several movies where the humane aspect of his characters prevail.\n\nDo not start looking for logical explanations for certain elements of the movie, do not psychoanalyse it and try to find faults... this movie is just like life itself, sometimes logical, sometimes illogical, often random. Just watch, enjoy and get carried away by the witty dialogue. Despite all the adversities one might encounter, it's those little things - how insignificant they may be - that make it worthwhile and helps everyone become the unique individuals we are.\n\nThis is a sincere movie suitable for the whole family that manages to stay out of the tear-jerker or kiddy movie categories. Special mention also for the soundtrack! If you liked this you might also want to check out The Malabar Princess.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2931,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-12-18","keywords":"butterfly,vercors,caterpillar,single mother,hiking","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1014479385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3MTM1YjYtNTAzOS00ZDk2LWE3MDQtMWI3NjQ2YWY1NWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTk3MTM1YjYtNTAzOS00ZDk2LWE3MDQtMWI3NjQ2YWY1NWJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785664/","name":"Michel Serrault","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1237271/","name":"Claire Bouanich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0226383/","name":"Nade Dieu"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003974/","name":"Philippe Muyl"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012976/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022162/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003974/","name":"Philippe Muyl"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When I learned of its existence, as a great lover of wolves, I rushed to order the DVD, which conveniently has English subtitles. I was not disappointed. Several wolves star in this film, along with the humans. Apart from the black wolf cub at the beginning, these wolves are not 'cute', and this is far from being a Walt Disney movie. This is gritty stuff. The lead is played by French/Corsican actress Letitia Casta, a beautiful creature who became a famous model as a teenager and is now a well-established film actress. She wants to be a veterinarian, and everyone scoffs at her about this, because it is the 1920s. (We are informed in a post credit that the first woman to become a vet in France obtained her qualifications in 1931.) But most of all, Casta wants to save the wild wolves in the foothills of the French Alps above her home town, which is on the border with Italy. In the 1920s, wild wolves still existed there, so this story is very authentic. But the wicked Jean-Paul Rouve wants to kill all the wolves and ruin the area for commercial development. Meanwhile, 'the madman', a wild young man called Giuseppe who is considered 'fou' by the locals, lives alone in a remote shack high up in the mountains where he keeps a donkey in his bedroom and has befriended a pack of wolves who hang around his door and are his only friends. The leader of the pack is the amazing black wolf whom he calls Carbone, whose eyes blaze from his black face like two searchlights. Casta and Giuseppe meet when he and Carbone jointly save her from freezing to death, and Carbone licks her face to revive her because he remembers her scent, as she is the one who saved him years before as an orphan cub. Having dislocated her leg, Casta has to remain for many days in Giuseppe's shack and gets to know him and realizes that he is a deeply sensitive and sympathetic soul. Indeed, Casta carried this realization beyond the screen, because she is now married to the actor who played Giuseppe, Stefano Accorsi, and has two children by him. The story is complex and cannot easily be summarised. Can Casta and Giuseppe together save the wolves, or will the forces of 'progress' win? There is a fascinating 34-minute 'making of' documentary on the DVD entitled BETWEEN MEN AND WOLVES. It has no English subtitles but is well worth watching regardless, as it reveals the incredible feats of the special effects men which were carried out on location in the snow, and above all it shows the work with the wolves and the tame eagle. Eagles are really terrifying if they attack, or even if they don't, frankly. They can kill any animal within seconds. The film features a scene where the eagle attacks a wolf cub and swoops just as the cub escapes into a hole in the rocks. Not long ago I came face to face with a wounded buzzard on the ground, and his vicious hissing and his savage beak as he faced me down and refused to retreat were pretty scary, but a buzzard is nothing compared to an eagle, being only about half the size. I hope I never 'scale up' and come face to face with a desperate eagle. In the documentary, we are informed that both French and American wolves were used, but there were many complaints about the American wolves being too wild and difficult to work with compared to the French ones, who were easier and had greater politesse, being French of course, and thus better mannered. At the end of the documentary, we are treated to scenes of the entire cast and crew howling like wolves. They freely admitted to getting very carried away by their wolfish friends during the filming and doing wolf howls became something they did regularly. Wolves are some of the most fascinating and gentle animals except when they are upset, and then watch out. There is one suckling scene with a female wolf nursing her cubs in a den. So the wolves are by no means just 'extras', they do have real acting roles in this film. This is a genuine, rather than a mawkish and superficial, film, and the director, cast and crew all deserve great praise for making it such a wonderful experience. It is suitable for families, unless parents are concerned at their children seeing a horse with an erection who attempts to mate with a mare, for as we know, farm life is very distant now from modern audiences, and there are some people who really believe that meat only exists when wrapped in plastic and who think that carrots grow on trees. This film is not only deeply satisfying but is an incredible achievement, considering how very difficult it was to get the wolves to make such excellent film debuts.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2008-02-13","keywords":"man in a wheelchair,modeling for a sculpture,veterinarian,mountain,following someone","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0144377/","name":"Laetitia Casta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009629/","name":"Stefano Accorsi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499448/","name":"Gilles Legrand"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033266/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190586/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0210997/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0181924/","name":"Jean Cosmos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0499448/","name":"Gilles Legrand"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1356887/","name":"Philippe Vuaillat"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Some of my favorites were Tom Jackson as White Bull, Tom Bateman as Viking, Emmy Rossum as Kim, Julia Jones as the wife and I could go on, all these people and more are a delight and give the movie flavor and texture.\n\nI found this film as entertaining as any I've seen lately.

A French journalist in Afghanistan is kidnapped by the Taliban." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1656192/","name":"Forces spéciales","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY4NTA5NjA1Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM3NDA1OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A French journalist in Afghanistan is kidnapped by the Taliban.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1656192/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"brchthethird"},"dateCreated":"2014-11-14","inLanguage":"English","name":"A solid portrayal of modern warfare","reviewBody":"While a tad overlong and light on character development, SPECIAL FORCES nevertheless delivers a fairly solid entry in the modern warfare genre. The plot is rather simple: a French special forces unit (the movie is French/French-produced) is sent in to rescue a journalist from Afghanistan who has been captured by a Taliban warlord. Right off the bat, you are introduced to the principal characters, but not much is given in the way of character development or making the audience care, aside from some small character moments interspersed throughout the latter half of the film. The performances are adequate, with the best being given by Diane Kruger (as the journalist) and Djimon Hounsou (one of the special forces guys). The actor who portrays the Taliban warlord also does a good job, probably adding some depth to his character by having him be Western-educated and somewhat caught between Western culture and his own culture and beliefs, but not much attention is paid to his character either. It also doesn't help that his demise later in the film is done so haphazardly and unceremoniously. As far as the combat sequences go, they were fine and done in current "en vogue" style of somewhat shaky "cinema verite" realism to give a sense of the chaos of battle. The violence was effective and not gratuitous in any way. However, towards the end the movie drags a little bit as we're shown day after day passing of the core group trying to get away from their pursuers and safely back into Afghanistan (they've been wandering around in the Pakistani desert for most of the movie).

The plot is rather simple: a French special forces unit (the movie is French/French-produced) is sent in to rescue a journalist from Afghanistan who has been captured by a Taliban warlord. Right off the bat, you are introduced to the principal characters, but not much is given in the way of character development or making the audience care, aside from some small character moments interspersed throughout the latter half of the film. The performances are adequate, with the best being given by Diane Kruger (as the journalist) and Djimon Hounsou (one of the special forces guys). The actor who portrays the Taliban warlord also does a good job, probably adding some depth to his character by having him be Western-educated and somewhat caught between Western culture and his own culture and beliefs, but not much attention is paid to his character either. It also doesn't help that his demise later in the film is done so haphazardly and unceremoniously. As far as the combat sequences go, they were fine and done in current "en vogue" style of somewhat shaky "cinema verite" realism to give a sense of the chaos of battle. The violence was effective and not gratuitous in any way. However, towards the end the movie drags a little bit as we're shown day after day passing of the core group trying to get away from their pursuers and safely back into Afghanistan (they've been wandering around in the Pakistani desert for most of the movie). Overall, the movie is effective in the combat sequences and showing how the special forces team bond with the people they try to rescue. Over the course of the film, you do grow to care a little bit more about the characters but not because you feel like you really know them, just because you empathize with the sticky situation they're in. The movie aspires to be SAVING PRIVATE RYAN (made by the French, and set during the Afghan war), but it falls short of the mark.

Emmanuelle Devos won the César for her performance as Carla the deaf office worker, and she dominates the movie along with the sexy, sleazy Paul (Vincent Cassel), a recently paroled petty thief.  The movie is about their odd relationship -- mutual exploitation, let's call it -- and about the successful caper that results as well as Carla's newfound power at the busy property development company where she hires Paul, despite his complete lack of office skills, as her assistant.  It's obvious she's lonely and looks on this as a chance to get a man, but it's also a chance to have somebody to kick around the way she's been kicked around at the office, and, when she sees the value of it, a chance to use his muscle and menace to bolster her job.\n\n What neither of them anticipates is the way their mutual dependency and very different skills lead them into intimacy and crime -- not necessarily in that order.   Audiard, who co-scripted the film with Tonino Benacquista, and who's known for the richly entertaining `A Self-Made Hero' (`Un Héros Très Discret," 1996), adopts here a very selective, liquid, often claustrophobic way of filming and editing.  He uses a lot of tight close-ups, dark lighting, and fast cuts between scenes that are as rapid and unceremonious as Benoît Jacquot's in the 1998 `School of Flesh' (`L'École de la Chair'). We know we have to stay on our toes.  We're expected to pay close attention and do some thinking.\n\nWe also often feel we're spying on people from Carla's point of view, as she does when she reads the lips of gossiping coworkers for herself (and later for Paul) at the office canteen, or when at Paul's prompting she uses binoculars to read lips in a gangland nightclub owner's apartment that Paul starts casing out after he's forced because of a debt to moonlight at the club. In her apartment we see her put on Paul's bloody shirt naked after he's been beaten, or try on sexy new shoes the same way, and again the camera angle is dark and close up so we only glimpse parts of her in the dirty mirror. (There's a parallelism between iris-ed images in the movie and Carla's limited hearing.) This is an intrusive, expressionistic camera, but the editing makes us maintain an alert distance as the plot moves from Carla's initially limited existence to its transformation by the explosive personality of Paul and the more and more dangerous embroilments that happen when the two become a mutually exploitive team.\n\nWe keep seeing the characters enter into yet one more new scene that we sense is risky without quite knowing why.  Somehow we're detached and scared at the same time.  Paul and Carla each create a world of uncertainty and peril for each other.  There's a growing unease that turns into increasing excitement and danger, and finally there's Hitchcockian suspense effectively augmented by forceful cross-cutting between Carla watching the gangsters through the apartment windows after a heist and Paul manning the noisy nightclub bar, which now also has become a threatening place.\n\nThe movie has flaws.  An airline ticket seems to have wings.  Carla is too magically able to carry out Paul's instructions, gathered only from a few hastily mouthed words lip-read between two buildings.  A subplot concerning Paul's parole officer (Olivier Perrier) is superfluous and confusing. Given that so much effective use is made of varying sound levels to convey Carla's hearing with and without her two hearing aids -- turned up, turned down, or removed -- the musical background score in non-nightclub scenes is obtrusive.\n\nBut what's strong about this movie is that it has two actors with the power to dominate the screen, and a director who works with a lot of authority and freshness in presenting his vision.\n\nEmmanuelle Devos' characterization as the mousy but smart and persistent Carla is so rich and assured we may just take it for granted -- but the French film industry didn't, since they not only gave her the César, but did so in a year when the other contenders were Charlotte Rampling in `Sur la Sable,' Audrey Tautou in `Amélie,' and Isabelle Huppert in `La Pianiste." Vincent Cassel, who's said he's an instinctive actor, simply embodies his part:  it's his prison tattoo, his sleazy mustache, his oily hair, and his tall, wiry, threatening physicality that make him both repulsive and sexy as Paul.  We experience here the powerful onscreen presence that's turned him into one of the hottest young film actors in France since he starred in Mattieu Kassovitz's `La Haine' in 1995.  (He was seen in the US last year in the enjoyable costume flick, `Le Pacte des Loups,' and is in a lot of new movies to come.)\n\nPeople are saying this is sure to lead to an American remake with big stars. Maybe so, but it's Audiard's vision that makes the picture interesting. All the Hollywood stars in the world won't take the place of Audiard's handheld camera and mercurial editing style, or a unique talent that combines sensitivity to the indignities of office workers and parolees with the ability to reinvent film noir tradition.\n\nAlso unique -- and unlikely to survive an American remake -- is the repression of sexuality between Paul and Carla, which makes the sexual tension between them seem all the more powerful throughout this tightly constructed, economical movie."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15075,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2001-10-17","keywords":"fetish,deaf woman,gangster,single woman,disappearance of sister","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0222922/","name":"Emmanuelle Devos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0332709/","name":"Olivier Gourmet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010766/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002191/","name":"Jacques Audiard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070152/","name":"Tonino Benacquista"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The filming is purposely dark and grungy - don't expect too much of Sci- Fi this is mainly about a clash of ideals.\n\nDefinitely worth a Netflix watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3750,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-11-23","keywords":"cyberpunk,transgender character,anarchist,france,fight","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0635262/","name":"Ola Rapace","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0503919/","name":"Micha Lescot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0359331/","name":"Thierry Hancisse"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070899/","name":"Jean-Patrick Benes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0315631/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172053/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2783886/","name":"Benjamin Dupas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5747900/","name":"Jérémie Guez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0070899/","name":"Jean-Patrick Benes"],"duration":"PT1H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Some might find it stupid while some will find it peculiarly interesting. People would expect it as a ridiculously fun bloody action film starring one of America's greatest Presidents. Since it's directed by Timur Bekmambetov, one of the most insane action movie directors ever, it suppose to be enjoyably crazy throughout. The film is fun when Abe is killing vampires with his axe, but it gets really different to the biography moments.

It's entertaining but it could have been a lot more fun.\n\nWith that kind of title, people would expect it as a campy horror action film with a different version of Abraham Lincoln that has a potential to be a movie icon. It sounds absurd, but that is acceptable to its title. Unfortunately, its absurdity is limited by the seriousness of the biographical parts. Both elements are strangely mismatch. Made this film a lot more awkward than you would thought. There is nothing wrong with having an accurate history to it. It just feels a lot different when you compare Lincoln's rise to Presidency to the whole vampire slaying sequences. It gets interesting when Henry Strugess distracts at Lincoln's personal life. Every time he appears, it makes you ready for some vampire action.\n\nThankfully, it has Timur Bekmambetov as the director. He's also a vampire movie expert by his Night Watch films. He can make his action scenes impossibly crazy that makes the whole experience a none stop entertainment. Too bad there isn't any glass for him to break in a ridiculously stylish way like he did in his other films. At least we still get to see something interesting, like Abe's axe spinning, throwing a vampire up to the sky, and turning that horse stampede chase into a large scale sequence. The rest is not quite inspired, but it still makes a pretty awesome action film. Like I wish it has more that. It's still entertaining for some reason. The WETA visuals look obvious. It fits well to the director's crazy vision.\n\nIt's hard to recommend Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter. It's not as ridiculous as the title. It connects to Lincoln's life in a serious way. They could have at least give a bit more campier and sillier tone to make this alternate version of Lincoln iconic. Even with an awesome director, energetic cast, and vampires that look scary and kill horrifyingly, it's still not a satisfying vampiric onslaught. It's not horrible or boring either. It just needs to be an endless crazy action movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":150845,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I've fell a victim for online reviews written by people related to the makers of the movie, concerned friends and family or what I suspect in this movie case, the "paid" hired help. This movie is terrible. I've never walked out on a movie before no matter how bad it was but my wife had to keep pulling my arm to stop me from storming out of the theater in rage and shame at Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes. Both names have made immortal art pieces at some time in their past (Memento for Mr Pearce and Go for msz Cruze). What compelled them to participate in such a monstrosity as this movie is beyond me. All I can think of is that they needed money badly. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF GUY PEARCE OR KATIE HOLMES DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. I wish someone told me this before I saw the movie because all of a sudden I don't really feel like watching either one's future movies. \n\nNow, to review the movie real quick, the story line had great potential. The acting CGI and soundtrack were all offensive to the sane, sober movie goer. The "monsters" are not fit to be in a Disney fairytale production. They looked like a conception of a freshman in computer-design major. The first time the creatures were revealed, the whole movie house broke out in laughter, THAT bad.\n\nThe last thing that I have to mention, those IMDb vote results are rigged. NOT by IMDb itself, obviously. A breakdown of the votes show me 400+ votes were 10. A number that no other "scary movie" has ever gotten. Scary movies are entertaining but they are not 10. But, hey, to each his own. A further breakdown reveals that 81 US users and 244 non-US users gave it 10. Hmmmm... A movie produced in the US, set in the US and is as American as a cheeseburger and yet the bulk majority of the people who thought it PERFECT are non US residents... Sounds too fishy. Why another reviewer here subscribes to IMDb and sings all glory to this movie while other "disputably" good movies were all rated one by that same user tells me there is money involved.\n\nBottom line, the movie is a complete waste of time and money. This movie will go down to the film history as The Fiasco of Guy Pearce, Katie Holmes and Mr del Toror. \n\n2 out of 10 for the fact that someone actually bothered and made this movie at all."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":47794,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-08-25","keywords":"mansion,basement,interior designer,fear,imp","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""They Will Whisper to You"","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2516622361","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwMTI2NDY0MDJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDIzMDc2MjMx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwMTI2NDY0MDJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDIzMDc2MjMx._V1_.jpg","description":"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005017/","name":"Katie Holmes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001602/","name":"Guy Pearce"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1933128/","name":"Bailee Madison"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2552536/","name":"Troy Nixey"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314851/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0368091/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0730422/","name":"Matthew Robbins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571111/","name":"Nigel McKeand"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I've fell a victim for online reviews written by people related to the makers of the movie, concerned friends and family or what I suspect in this movie case, the "paid" hired help. This movie is terrible. I've never walked out on a movie before no matter how bad it was but my wife had to keep pulling my arm to stop me from storming out of the theater in rage and shame at Guy Pearce and Katie Holmes. Both names have made immortal art pieces at some time in their past (Memento for Mr Pearce and Go for msz Cruze). What compelled them to participate in such a monstrosity as this movie is beyond me. All I can think of is that they needed money badly. IF YOU ARE A FAN OF GUY PEARCE OR KATIE HOLMES DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE. I wish someone told me this before I saw the movie because all of a sudden I don't really feel like watching either one's future movies. \n\nNow, to review the movie real quick, the story line had great potential. The acting CGI and soundtrack were all offensive to the sane, sober movie goer. The "monsters" are not fit to be in a Disney fairytale production. They looked like a conception of a freshman in computer-design major. The first time the creatures were revealed, the whole movie house broke out in laughter, THAT bad.\n\nThe last thing that I have to mention, those IMDb vote results are rigged. NOT by IMDb itself, obviously. A breakdown of the votes show me 400+ votes were 10. A number that no other "scary movie" has ever gotten. Scary movies are entertaining but they are not 10. But, hey, to each his own. A further breakdown reveals that 81 US users and 244 non-US users gave it 10. Hmmmm... A movie produced in the US, set in the US and is as American as a cheeseburger and yet the bulk majority of the people who thought it PERFECT are non US residents... Sounds too fishy. Why another reviewer here subscribes to IMDb and sings all glory to this movie while other "disputably" good movies were all rated one by that same user tells me there is money involved.\n\nBottom line, the movie is a complete waste of time and money. This movie will go down to the film history as The Fiasco of Guy Pearce, Katie Holmes and Mr del Toror. \n\n2 out of 10 for the fact that someone actually bothered and made this movie at all.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":47794,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-08-25","keywords":"mansion,basement,interior designer,fear,imp","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""They Will Whisper to You"","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2516622361","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwMTI2NDY0MDJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDIzMDc2MjMx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAwMTI2NDY0MDJeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDIzMDc2MjMx._V1_.jpg","description":"Don't Be Afraid of the Dark","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005017/","name":"Katie Holmes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001602/","name":"Guy Pearce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1933128/","name":"Bailee Madison"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2552536/","name":"Troy Nixey"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314851/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0368091/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0730422/","name":"Matthew Robbins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571111/","name":"Nigel McKeand"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It was a delightful movie, filled with the wriest humour. Funny how synchronicity plays a big role in everything, just that morning I had had a discussion with a friend about dealing with older parents and the various issues involved. I loved the dialogue in the movie, I hope it came across as well in the sub-titles. The film focuses on relationships which are extremely varied. I thought the most interesting was between Romain and the hotelier. The interchanges were sparse but very meaningful. You could easily become the hotelier and understand his situation. Other characters were off the wall such as the receptionist at the tourist bureau in Normandy and the gas bar attendant. The grandmother was a determined individual who loved every minute of life. There was a mixture of all sorts of different scenes, that you never got bored. Romain's room mate was also a real mec, always pursuing the latest gonzesse!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-01-14","keywords":"death of grandmother,85 year old,62 year old,23 year old,loss of grandmother","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003508/","name":"Michel Blanc"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179684/","name":"Annie Cordy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3521548/","name":"Mathieu Spinosi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0405239/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0313479/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2271931/","name":"David Foenkinos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Les souvenirs: Directed by Jean-Paul Rouve. With Michel Blanc, Annie Cordy, Mathieu Spinosi, Chantal Lauby. Romain, 23, is the watchman of a small Paris hotel. He does not know it yet but he is about to become a novelist... Madeleine is six decades older than him. She is his grandmother. Surprisingly enough, the age gap does not mean a thing for them: they mesh like magic. It looks as if they were born the same day. One day, Madeleine escapes from the nursing home where she has been placed against her will by her sons (one of whom, Michel, is Romain's father). Romain asks his employer for a leave and joins her in Etretat. Both have a wonderful day in the town of Madeleine's youth..." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt3519272/","name":"Les souvenirs","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyYTZmNzktOTA2ZS00NDI3LTg2ZTQtMWNjY2ZmMjIxNmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Njg3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Romain, 23, is the watchman of a small Paris hotel.

It was a delightful movie, filled with the wriest humour. Funny how synchronicity plays a big role in everything, just that morning I had had a discussion with a friend about dealing with older parents and the various issues involved. I loved the dialogue in the movie, I hope it came across as well in the sub-titles. The film focuses on relationships which are extremely varied. I thought the most interesting was between Romain and the hotelier. The interchanges were sparse but very meaningful. You could easily become the hotelier and understand his situation. Other characters were off the wall such as the receptionist at the tourist bureau in Normandy and the gas bar attendant. The grandmother was a determined individual who loved every minute of life. There was a mixture of all sorts of different scenes, that you never got bored. Romain's room mate was also a real mec, always pursuing the latest gonzesse!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-01-14","keywords":"death of grandmother,85 year old,62 year old,23 year old,loss of grandmother","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003508/","name":"Michel Blanc","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179684/","name":"Annie Cordy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3521548/","name":"Mathieu Spinosi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0405239/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0313479/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2271931/","name":"David Foenkinos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It was a delightful movie, filled with the wriest humour. Funny how synchronicity plays a big role in everything, just that morning I had had a discussion with a friend about dealing with older parents and the various issues involved. I loved the dialogue in the movie, I hope it came across as well in the sub-titles. The film focuses on relationships which are extremely varied. I thought the most interesting was between Romain and the hotelier. The interchanges were sparse but very meaningful. You could easily become the hotelier and understand his situation. Other characters were off the wall such as the receptionist at the tourist bureau in Normandy and the gas bar attendant. The grandmother was a determined individual who loved every minute of life. There was a mixture of all sorts of different scenes, that you never got bored. Romain's room mate was also a real mec, always pursuing the latest gonzesse!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-01-14","keywords":"death of grandmother,85 year old,62 year old,23 year old,loss of grandmother","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003508/","name":"Michel Blanc"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179684/","name":"Annie Cordy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3521548/","name":"Mathieu Spinosi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0405239/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0313479/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2271931/","name":"David Foenkinos"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Surprisingly enough, the age gap does not mean a thing for them: they mesh like magic. It looks as if they were born the same day. One day, Madeleine escapes from the nursing home where she has been placed against her will by her sons (one of whom, Michel, is Romain's father). Romain asks his employer for a leave and joins her in Etretat. Both have a wonderful day in the town of Madeleine's youth..." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt3519272/","name":"Les souvenirs","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyYTZmNzktOTA2ZS00NDI3LTg2ZTQtMWNjY2ZmMjIxNmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQ3Njg3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Romain, 23, is the watchman of a small Paris hotel.

It was a delightful movie, filled with the wriest humour. Funny how synchronicity plays a big role in everything, just that morning I had had a discussion with a friend about dealing with older parents and the various issues involved. I loved the dialogue in the movie, I hope it came across as well in the sub-titles. The film focuses on relationships which are extremely varied. I thought the most interesting was between Romain and the hotelier. The interchanges were sparse but very meaningful. You could easily become the hotelier and understand his situation. Other characters were off the wall such as the receptionist at the tourist bureau in Normandy and the gas bar attendant. The grandmother was a determined individual who loved every minute of life. There was a mixture of all sorts of different scenes, that you never got bored. Romain's room mate was also a real mec, always pursuing the latest gonzesse!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-01-14","keywords":"death of grandmother,85 year old,62 year old,23 year old,loss of grandmother","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003508/","name":"Michel Blanc","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0179684/","name":"Annie Cordy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3521548/","name":"Mathieu Spinosi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0405239/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0313479/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069524/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2271931/","name":"David Foenkinos","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Christine is quite believable as manager of the Paris branch of a multinational (fake name, Barney Johnson, but mainly shown on their office paper) in product strategies for food, perfectly cast here as business woman. The main offices are in America (New York and Washington, so there are some English dialogs with executives from these offices, very short) and we see Isabelle going to Cairo (although surely not filmed there). She is not so believable as being the 2nd in command. I was not so aware of her having such high position until a Japanese delegation wants a picture with the 2 top managers of this firm (her and Christine). The work environment is quite unbelievable,just designer office rooms with a desk on which you almost don't see them doing anything and in the meetings they are in, nothing is discussed, only showing the ends of these meetings. But this movie is about the power struggle between these 2 and who they use and abuse for their purpose of getting to the top (Christine is aiming at a job in the head office in New York). This is the best part of the movie. Isabelle is extremely fanatical about her work, which means everything to her, she has no friends (as Sagnier said in a Dutch interview). This hard-working Isabelle does the best work but Christine claims it as having been hers on 3 occasions. Isabelle both admires (loves) and hates Christine. Christine says at one point that she loves Isabelle. Both have a love-affair with the same colleague, who at a certain moment is being blackmailed by Christine, much to the disgust of Isabelle. It all turns wrong when Christine shows security camera pictures of Isabelle having gotten angry and having a car accident in the garage and humiliates her in front of all their colleagues at a party, where she already felt uncomfortable, not talking with anyone. Christine meant it as a joke, she said, but her degrading remarks to Isabelle show otherwise. The rest of the movie is all about Isabelle's quite-clever-or-not revenge, which I won't reveal here (one can find more than enough about that already). It's all not terribly surprising or great cinema, but it is an entertaining thriller which grips you from beginning to end, despite some incredibleness. I think money is well spent on going to this movie, especially if you're a fan of Kristin Scott Thomas, who speaks excellent French and is great here, as usual. 104 minutes, some flashbacks in black and white. If you liked "La Tourneuse de Pages", this comes close, at least in the beginning. I have seen it twice now (2 pre-premieres) and must say the beginning remains fascinating, whereas the second part becomes weaker the more you see it, but it still is an ingenious detective plot, a tribute to this much too young deceased (67) film-maker.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5269,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-08-18","keywords":"taupe pantyhose,female stockinged legs,pantyhose,suntan pantyhose,female boss","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Love Crime","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1858509849","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMTQwNDE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg2ODEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMTQwNDE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg2ODEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When Christine, a powerful executive, brings on a naive young ingÃ©nue as her assistant, she delights in toying with her naivete and teaching her hard lessons in a ruthless professional philosophy.

By the end, you'll be satisfied viewing it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6016,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-12-26","keywords":"written by director,title directed by female,f rated,triple f rated,one word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sir (2018) Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1290190617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRlMzM4NDItMmIxOS00MjVhLWE3OTQtMDAzMjY0MjU3NzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRlMzM4NDItMmIxOS00MjVhLWE3OTQtMDAzMjY0MjU3NzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A prosperous young Indian man falls in love with his servant, a widow with the dream of becoming a tailor.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794818/","name":"Tillotama Shome","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1836649/","name":"Vivek Gomber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3453549/","name":"Geetanjali Kulkarni"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1402184/","name":"Rohena Gera"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057287/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0653190/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1402184/","name":"Rohena Gera"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Camera!  Action!  What makes a good movie?  Better yet, what makes a great movie?  In my opinion, a great movie should include almost flawless acting, a finely woven and gripping plot, music that is both beautiful and suitable, and great direction. Of course,  mesmerizing visuals and art direction can also contribute to great films.  So, for all the reasons above, I consider "The City Of Lost Children" the best film of 1996.\n\nThe plot of "The City Of Lost Children" is completely original and it never lets your mind wander off to other places.  It also involves quite a few fascinating and somewhat weird characters in a dreary harbor town called "The City Of Lost Children" (hence the title).   One(that is his name) is a slow-minded circus strongman who searches for his adopted little brother who has been kidnapped by a group of henchmen with robotic eyes called the Cyclops.  One's little brother has been kidnapped and taken to a quickly aging mad scientist named Krank so that his dreams may be stolen.  The mad scientist needs the dreams of children so that he will not age so quickly. The source of this problem is a curse that was put upon him.  Because of this curse, his wife is a midget, he cannot dream, and he has seven identical sons (all of whom have a strange sleeping disorder).  In this movie there is somewhat of a subplot that involves a wicked pair of unseparated siamese twin sisters.  These women run a sort of school where they have the children in it steal for them.  One small, but tough, girl named Miette runs away from the school, finds One, and aides him in his search.  When the two women find out about their little thief, they go to Marcello, a retired man who used to run a circus freakshow, to get what they need to catch and kill the little girl and her newfound friend.  Although this plot seems a bit hard to follow, it all fits together perfectly in the end with wondrous results.  To accompany this odd story,  there is a beautiful soundtrack composed by Angelo Badalmenti with one song ("Who Will Take Your Dreams Away") by Marianne Faithful.  This music fits the mood and plot of the story perfectly and stays with you(as does the movie itself) long after the credits have rolled.\n\nThe casting director of "The City Of Lost Children", Pierre-Jacques Benochou, sure knew what he was doing, because there is not one poor (or mediocre one, for that matter) performance in the whole film.  In fact, I might just say all the performances were virtually flawless.  Ron Perlman's performance as the slow and dimwitted circus strongman One is beautifully acted.  Mr. Perlman should especially be recognized because he is an American actor and this is a subtitled French film.  Daniel Emilfork as the depressed and dreamless mad scientist with a short temper is outstanding and most believable.  Dominique Pinon is wonderful (perhaps the best actor in the whole movie) as the seven rubberfaced identical brothers (yes, he does play all of them, and with fantastic results, too).  The two different actresses who portray the siamese twins, Odile Mallet and Genevieve Brunet, are perfectly wicked and their timing is impeccable.  Last, but not least, the children, with Judith Vittet as Miette in a stand-out performance, all carry out their roles with smashing results.\n\nAnother reason for me choosing "The City Of Lost Children" as the best movie of 1996 is its stunning direction.  This movie was directed by the famous French directing team of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro(a.k.a. "Jeunet and Caro").  The camera angles that are used during the course of this film are a totally different experience and they keep you mesmerized from start to finish.  The directors of this film are, in my opinion, masters of the camera.  The visuals in this movie also contributed to my conclusion that this is the best movie of 1996.  Whatever it might have been, whether the bleak and unique use of colors or the special effects, I was absolutely captivated by what I was seeing on the screen.  What I particularly liked about this film's special effects was that they were not the typical flashy and in-your-face computer special effects that some of today's blockbusters and other genre films seem to have.  I think such special effects distract you from the rest of the movie.  On the contrary, the special effects of "The City Of Lost Children," however, are very subtle.  A final thing I liked about this film were its sets.  From the waterlogged streets of the dank and moldy town to the spectacular gadgetry of Krank's laboratories everything was a magnificent panorama for the eye to behold.\n\nWas the plot great?  Yes.  How was the acting?  Outstanding.  Was the direction done well?  Definitely.  How did the visuals appear?  They were beautifully presented.

Camera!  Action!  What makes a good movie?  Better yet, what makes a great movie?  In my opinion, a great movie should include almost flawless acting, a finely woven and gripping plot, music that is both beautiful and suitable, and great direction. Of course,  mesmerizing visuals and art direction can also contribute to great films.  So, for all the reasons above, I consider "The City Of Lost Children" the best film of 1996.\n\nThe plot of "The City Of Lost Children" is completely original and it never lets your mind wander off to other places.  It also involves quite a few fascinating and somewhat weird characters in a dreary harbor town called "The City Of Lost Children" (hence the title).   One(that is his name) is a slow-minded circus strongman who searches for his adopted little brother who has been kidnapped by a group of henchmen with robotic eyes called the Cyclops.  One's little brother has been kidnapped and taken to a quickly aging mad scientist named Krank so that his dreams may be stolen.  The mad scientist needs the dreams of children so that he will not age so quickly. The source of this problem is a curse that was put upon him.  Because of this curse, his wife is a midget, he cannot dream, and he has seven identical sons (all of whom have a strange sleeping disorder).  In this movie there is somewhat of a subplot that involves a wicked pair of unseparated siamese twin sisters.  These women run a sort of school where they have the children in it steal for them.  One small, but tough, girl named Miette runs away from the school, finds One, and aides him in his search.  When the two women find out about their little thief, they go to Marcello, a retired man who used to run a circus freakshow, to get what they need to catch and kill the little girl and her newfound friend.  Although this plot seems a bit hard to follow, it all fits together perfectly in the end with wondrous results.  To accompany this odd story,  there is a beautiful soundtrack composed by Angelo Badalmenti with one song ("Who Will Take Your Dreams Away") by Marianne Faithful.  This music fits the mood and plot of the story perfectly and stays with you(as does the movie itself) long after the credits have rolled.\n\nThe casting director of "The City Of Lost Children", Pierre-Jacques Benochou, sure knew what he was doing, because there is not one poor (or mediocre one, for that matter) performance in the whole film.  In fact, I might just say all the performances were virtually flawless.  Ron Perlman's performance as the slow and dimwitted circus strongman One is beautifully acted.  Mr. Perlman should especially be recognized because he is an American actor and this is a subtitled French film.  Daniel Emilfork as the depressed and dreamless mad scientist with a short temper is outstanding and most believable.  Dominique Pinon is wonderful (perhaps the best actor in the whole movie) as the seven rubberfaced identical brothers (yes, he does play all of them, and with fantastic results, too).  The two different actresses who portray the siamese twins, Odile Mallet and Genevieve Brunet, are perfectly wicked and their timing is impeccable.  Last, but not least, the children, with Judith Vittet as Miette in a stand-out performance, all carry out their roles with smashing results.\n\nAnother reason for me choosing "The City Of Lost Children" as the best movie of 1996 is its stunning direction.  This movie was directed by the famous French directing team of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro(a.k.a. "Jeunet and Caro").  The camera angles that are used during the course of this film are a totally different experience and they keep you mesmerized from start to finish.  The directors of this film are, in my opinion, masters of the camera.  The visuals in this movie also contributed to my conclusion that this is the best movie of 1996.  Whatever it might have been, whether the bleak and unique use of colors or the special effects, I was absolutely captivated by what I was seeing on the screen.  What I particularly liked about this film's special effects was that they were not the typical flashy and in-your-face computer special effects that some of today's blockbusters and other genre films seem to have.  I think such special effects distract you from the rest of the movie.  On the contrary, the special effects of "The City Of Lost Children," however, are very subtle.  A final thing I liked about this film were its sets.  From the waterlogged streets of the dank and moldy town to the spectacular gadgetry of Krank's laboratories everything was a magnificent panorama for the eye to behold.\n\nWas the plot great?  Yes.  How was the acting?  Outstanding.  Was the direction done well?  Definitely.  How did the visuals appear?  They were beautifully presented.  From what you have read, whether you have concluded to avoid this movie completely or go out and rent it right away (I do understand that this movie does have a select audience), I am hopeful that you understand the picture I am trying to paint.  Even if the story will not appeal to you, it is still splendidly done.  Overall, though, "The City Of Lost Children" is definitely the best movie of 1996 for me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":66486,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1995-05-17","keywords":"psychotronic film,underwater scene,children,dream,aging","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The City of Lost Children","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4236902681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlkNTAzY2MtNmVjYS00Mzk5LWJlNGYtNzI1N2JhZDgwMmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDlkNTAzY2MtNmVjYS00Mzk5LWJlNGYtNzI1N2JhZDgwMmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256399/","name":"Daniel Emilfork","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0900136/","name":"Judith Vittet"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070568/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054943/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0545615/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0012496/","name":"Gilles Adrien","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000466/","name":"Jean-Pierre Jeunet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001988/","name":"Marc Caro"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Christine is quite believable as manager of the Paris branch of a multinational (fake name, Barney Johnson, but mainly shown on their office paper) in product strategies for food, perfectly cast here as business woman. The main offices are in America (New York and Washington, so there are some English dialogs with executives from these offices, very short) and we see Isabelle going to Cairo (although surely not filmed there). She is not so believable as being the 2nd in command. I was not so aware of her having such high position until a Japanese delegation wants a picture with the 2 top managers of this firm (her and Christine). The work environment is quite unbelievable,just designer office rooms with a desk on which you almost don't see them doing anything and in the meetings they are in, nothing is discussed, only showing the ends of these meetings. But this movie is about the power struggle between these 2 and who they use and abuse for their purpose of getting to the top (Christine is aiming at a job in the head office in New York). This is the best part of the movie. Isabelle is extremely fanatical about her work, which means everything to her, she has no friends (as Sagnier said in a Dutch interview). This hard-working Isabelle does the best work but Christine claims it as having been hers on 3 occasions. Isabelle both admires (loves) and hates Christine. Christine says at one point that she loves Isabelle. Both have a love-affair with the same colleague, who at a certain moment is being blackmailed by Christine, much to the disgust of Isabelle. It all turns wrong when Christine shows security camera pictures of Isabelle having gotten angry and having a car accident in the garage and humiliates her in front of all their colleagues at a party, where she already felt uncomfortable, not talking with anyone. Christine meant it as a joke, she said, but her degrading remarks to Isabelle show otherwise. The rest of the movie is all about Isabelle's quite-clever-or-not revenge, which I won't reveal here (one can find more than enough about that already). It's all not terribly surprising or great cinema, but it is an entertaining thriller which grips you from beginning to end, despite some incredibleness. I think money is well spent on going to this movie, especially if you're a fan of Kristin Scott Thomas, who speaks excellent French and is great here, as usual. 104 minutes, some flashbacks in black and white. If you liked "La Tourneuse de Pages", this comes close, at least in the beginning. I have seen it twice now (2 pre-premieres) and must say the beginning remains fascinating, whereas the second part becomes weaker the more you see it, but it still is an ingenious detective plot, a tribute to this much too young deceased (67) film-maker.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5269,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-08-18","keywords":"taupe pantyhose,female stockinged legs,pantyhose,suntan pantyhose,female boss","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Love Crime","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1858509849","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMTQwNDE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg2ODEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxMTQwNDE1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg2ODEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When Christine, a powerful executive, brings on a naive young ingÃ©nue as her assistant, she delights in toying with her naivete and teaching her hard lessons in a ruthless professional philosophy.

There is little to discuss about the film's undeniable cinematic qualities. The biological richness achieved is also remarkable. The problem is that it is unachieved. As such, it will satisfy a young audience, or an audience of naive adults, but does not satisfy the curiosity of an adult audience capable of critical thinking. I do not deny the biological success achieved. But I do believe that the authors owe the adult audience more transparency about the ins and outs of their project. Notably: \n* What was the initial project as endorsed by the investors? Purely agricultural, or eco-tourism, or even cinematographic (this film being then the completion of the project, the farm itself being then only a by-product of the financial project)?\n* what is the financial track record of the operation? In this balance sheet, what is the share of income from agriculture and what is the share of eco-tourism?\n* what is the production (measured in tonnage per unit of area)? What is the balance sheet in man-work units?\nIn other words, what is the cost of success? My question is not a sly one. Personally, I sincerely believe that this type of agriculture is bound to develop. But if we are serious about getting our fellow citizens interested in it, we must be honest about the consequences of the proposed changes.

There is little to discuss about the film's undeniable cinematic qualities. The biological richness achieved is also remarkable. The problem is that it is unachieved. As such, it will satisfy a young audience, or an audience of naive adults, but does not satisfy the curiosity of an adult audience capable of critical thinking. I do not deny the biological success achieved. But I do believe that the authors owe the adult audience more transparency about the ins and outs of their project. Notably: \n* What was the initial project as endorsed by the investors? Purely agricultural, or eco-tourism, or even cinematographic (this film being then the completion of the project, the farm itself being then only a by-product of the financial project)?\n* what is the financial track record of the operation? In this balance sheet, what is the share of income from agriculture and what is the share of eco-tourism?\n* what is the production (measured in tonnage per unit of area)? What is the balance sheet in man-work units?\nIn other words, what is the cost of success? My question is not a sly one. Personally, I sincerely believe that this type of agriculture is bound to develop. But if we are serious about getting our fellow citizens interested in it, we must be honest about the consequences of the proposed changes. The consequences are a larger farming population (a movement that is the opposite of the historical movement of mankind). Less calibrated agricultural products. Lower per capita yields. None of this is embarrassing to me. I simply regret that the authors of this film preferred ease to pedagogy. By showing a little more transparency, they could have made an excellent movie from a simply good movie. 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6348,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2019-05-10","keywords":"climate change,sustainable farming,farm,pig,dog","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1108326937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBkYmY3OTYtYWU1ZC00N2YxLWFjMGYtYTNkZjY2YWE5ZTdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTBkYmY3OTYtYWU1ZC00N2YxLWFjMGYtYTNkZjY2YWE5ZTdkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Documentarian John Chester and his wife Molly work to develop a sustainable farm on 200 acres outside of Los Angeles.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092965/","name":"John Chester","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10107265/","name":"Molly Chester","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12612142/","name":"Beauden Chester"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092965/","name":"John Chester"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0250936/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0713087/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2092965/","name":"John Chester","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0598531/","name":"Mark Monroe"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Thus, just a fair rating for me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2017-09-20","keywords":"painter,artist,starving artist,paris france,year 1891","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Gauguin: Voyage to Tahiti","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1626389273","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2MTU5NGYtMDJjOC00NDhhLTk2NDQtNmExOGRkYjRhZjgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2MTU5NGYtMDJjOC00NDhhLTk2NDQtNmExOGRkYjRhZjgxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9225337/","name":"Tuheï Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956026/","name":"Malik Zidi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435120/","name":"Edouard Deluc"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065288/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0650953/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435120/","name":"Edouard Deluc","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0173541/","name":"Etienne Comar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1662707/","name":"Thomas Lilti"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And while I think thats true, I think its a bit more complex than that. It also is a bit of a coming of age story where Joe has to grow up and be the adult in this family, but also it seems that mom is having a mid-life crisis (although shes not quite mid-life) and trying to discover who she is outside of being the "perfect 50s housewife" that perhaps she feels trapped in. There's a lot of symbolism in this movie. The backdrop of this movie is that there is a wildfire that has been raging and the townspeople have been desperately trying to put out. And that correlates with Joe and his own family. Hes trying to put out the fire in his own family. Also, Joe works at photography studio and Paul Dano (the director and co-writer) even said that this is supposed to be a PORTRAIT of a family life. \n\nSpeaking of Paul Dano, I think he did well with his directorial debut. I think visually there are some gorgeous shots in this movie. Like for instance where Joe is watching the wildfires (and hes perfectly centered - probably again to mimic the portrait vibe). Also where Joe is about to give up but it starts to snow and hope has regained. I liked the film for the most part. They do frame the film by following Joe's perspective. And I think its mostly effective in making you feel for this kid, my only problem is there are a couple of parts where I feel like there are gaps in the story. Without giving too much away there is a scene where Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal) has decided to seek revenge and it ends up backfiring. And yet, the next time we see him everything seems to be fine. And it never really gets explained what happened. Theres a brief line that they decided it was a "misunderstanding" but you never really see what happened and he also gets hurt during this, and that never gets brought up again either. I know Paul and Zoe (the other writer) were adapting this from a book and perhaps thats the way it is in there too. But I personally found that a little frustrating. I needed a little more. \n\nCarey Mulligan is fantastic in this. She would be deserving to have her name thrown in the hat for awards season. I also thought Ed Oxenbould was a standout too. Which is good to hear since he's onscreen for pretty much most of the movie. I definitely will be looking forward to more of his things. I also thought Jake Gyllenhaal was good but hes absent for a good chunk of the film and so he just didnt stand out as much as Carey or Ed did.\n\nOverall I liked the film. It wasn't perfect, but I would totally check out another film that Paul Dano directs.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26616,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-01-01","keywords":"1960s,unemployment,photography,infidelity,firefighter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1986312985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A boy witnesses his parents' marriage falling apart after his mother finds another man."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590837/","name":"Ed Oxenbould"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0585931/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0564372/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625497/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1443740/","name":"Zoe Kazan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285840/","name":"Richard Ford"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The scenery is great, actors are authentic. We don't "see" Algeria, we can smell it, feel it and even the sun can burn your skin through the screen. I never went to Algeria, and I don't have anything to do with this country. I never planned to go there and I never thought I'd say this one day: this movie made me love the country. I want to add "visit Algeria" in my "to do list". \n\nFahrid's statement at the end clearly explains what the movie is dealing with. He says "I still don't know if my experience is good or bad. but I'm not the same guy anymore". \n\nGreat movie, congratulations","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":633,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-06-19","keywords":"lawyer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416126/","name":"Tewfik Jallab","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0213354/","name":"Jamel Debbouze","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4238622/","name":"Fatsah Bouyahmed"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5627015/","name":"Mohamed Hamidi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098808/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142567/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044140/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5627015/","name":"Mohamed Hamidi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0086912/","name":"Alain-Michel Blanc"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But when Zach and his friend (Ryan Lee) break into Hanna's house to  free her from her father, they not only discover that Shivers is  actually kid lit author R.L.

Put the two together and you get an escalating set of events in which the video freelancer goes to greater and greater extremes to film shocking scenes of crime, encouraged along by the media editor who is paying for his results.\n\nWhat makes the film more interesting than just another action drama is the social commentary and the character studies. The main characters are very well crafted, believable, explained through back drop and excellently acted out. The parallels between them are also interesting to observe. Both pretty much without any care for the people around them and focused solely on personal gain. What the video guy will do to get his paycheck is shocking, but what the media editor will do to get her news reel is just as distasteful.\n\nThe social commentary is also sharp. The media is portrayed essentially as caring about nothing but a good story, even in fact if that story happens to be untrue. What matters is the narrative and the narrative has to fit the agenda of the media agency. By this measure all news is little more than propaganda. The video guy, despite his barbaric methods and behaviour, is also tolerated by those around him and the message, at least from the media editor and her team (acknowledging one dissenting voice in the film), is that it is OK to be cruel and to hurt others if it is in the pursuit of personal ambition. Both are valid observations and comments on today's society, whether we, the viewers, happen to agree with them or not.\n\nThe film also has a touch of originality which isn't easy to do these days when so many movies have already been made. Yes there are studies out there of psychos, yes there are films that vilify the media and there are films about morbid voyeurism and about the exploitation of victims of crime for personal gain. The originality comes from putting them all together. I couldn't really think of a parallel, although others might.\n\nThis is well worth watching. You may not ultimately enjoy the film, after all it isn't pleasant, but I am fairly sure you will remember it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":490184,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-10-31","keywords":"sociopath,tv news,ethics,journalism ethics,journalism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exclusive Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4179799833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0MTMzOTQwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI4ODAzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0MTMzOTQwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI4ODAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When Lou Bloom, a driven man desperate for work, muscles into the world of L.A. crime journalism, he blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story.

Put the two together and you get an escalating set of events in which the video freelancer goes to greater and greater extremes to film shocking scenes of crime, encouraged along by the media editor who is paying for his results.\n\nWhat makes the film more interesting than just another action drama is the social commentary and the character studies. The main characters are very well crafted, believable, explained through back drop and excellently acted out. The parallels between them are also interesting to observe. Both pretty much without any care for the people around them and focused solely on personal gain. What the video guy will do to get his paycheck is shocking, but what the media editor will do to get her news reel is just as distasteful.\n\nThe social commentary is also sharp. The media is portrayed essentially as caring about nothing but a good story, even in fact if that story happens to be untrue. What matters is the narrative and the narrative has to fit the agenda of the media agency. By this measure all news is little more than propaganda. The video guy, despite his barbaric methods and behaviour, is also tolerated by those around him and the message, at least from the media editor and her team (acknowledging one dissenting voice in the film), is that it is OK to be cruel and to hurt others if it is in the pursuit of personal ambition. Both are valid observations and comments on today's society, whether we, the viewers, happen to agree with them or not.\n\nThe film also has a touch of originality which isn't easy to do these days when so many movies have already been made. Yes there are studies out there of psychos, yes there are films that vilify the media and there are films about morbid voyeurism and about the exploitation of victims of crime for personal gain. The originality comes from putting them all together. I couldn't really think of a parallel, although others might.\n\nThis is well worth watching. You may not ultimately enjoy the film, after all it isn't pleasant, but I am fairly sure you will remember it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":490184,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-10-31","keywords":"sociopath,tv news,ethics,journalism ethics,journalism","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exclusive Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4179799833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0MTMzOTQwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI4ODAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0MTMzOTQwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTI4ODAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When Lou Bloom, a driven man desperate for work, muscles into the world of L.A. crime journalism, he blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story.

There, Solomon witnesses numerous acts of cruelty that no man should ever face.\n\nAs I stared at the movie screen with full dread, I was reeling back at certain scenes I had just witnessed. There were good films and television shows about slavery before, and they had various nuances at how to tackle slavery. This film is part of said resurgence of the sub- genre, hot on the heels of "Django Unchained" and "The Butler". But while the former relinquishes on Spaghetti Western entertainment more than attempting to address the issue in a political light as the latter, Steve McQueen's "12 Years a Slave" shuts those two up, and perhaps the entire sub-genre, for good. I doubt any future slavery-themed film will be as harrowing as this one was.\n\nSteve McQueen is a fearless filmmaker, continuing his streak of unfiltered brutality within human depths. He frames his actors' faces in extreme close-up, the eyes staring into despair, the nostrils fuming in aggression. Naked flesh are shown not because of erotic content, but rather because of desperation and futility. Long takes and wide shots are not uncommon in his films, and here they showcase a plethora of fantastic scenes and performances that work to discomfort the viewer as much as possible. McQueen doesn't just allow the audience to tackle slavery, he guts the audience and leaves them for the consequences. This is an extremely uncomfortable film to watch. Beautifully shot locations are placeholders for unsettling sequences before and after, contemplated by Hans Zimmer's poignant and at times horrifying score. This all works to create a nightmarish time and place where hell walks on Earth.\n\nCentral to all of this is the performance of Chiwetel Ejiofor as Solomon. Ejiofor showcases that he is a natural force to be reckoned with in this film, after a decade of mostly supporting characters. He spaces out in despair as the camera lingers onto him for solid minutes, not a word spoken. Another sequence shows him mourning the death of a fellow worker, in which the singing of the surrounding group compels him and shakes him down to tears. These scenes follow earlier ones where he is a classy, free man in the upper states, mingling happily with the crowd and partaking in fanciful music sessions. It is a tour-de-force performance.\n\nA fine ensemble of established and up-and-coming actors surround Ejiofor in his limelight - Paul Dano, Paul Giammati, Alfre Woodard, Sarah Paulson, even Brad Pitt and Benedict Cumberbatch, but none so ferociously as McQueen regular Michael Fassbender as the despicable, sadistic plantation owner Edwin Epps. So excellent and terrifying is Fassbender's portrayal of such a merciless and barbaric person, that the mere sight of him will either cause audience members unfamiliar to him to flinch.\n\nI was left speechless as the credits rolled. A lesser film would have added tacked-on sentimentality/exaggeration and politically influenced claptrap. Not this one. This is a movie to watch as a reminder of how powerful the human spirit can endeavor, and how lucky all of us have grown past that dreadful time in history. The full effect of it has not been felt in movies before, until now.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":655561,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I think the uninspired, boring story writing was probably the worst aspect of the movie overall.

It is a slapstick-heavy family movie that should delight young children and keep parents entertained.\n\nThe Croods are the last remaining family in an arid desert landscape. They have survived by following family patriarch Grug's (Nicolas Cage) rules to the letter, including staying in the cave after dark and fearing anything that seems new (new is BAAAD). Despite this, teenage daughter Eep (Emma Stone) wants to break free and rebels against her father, which results in a chance meeting with the highly inventive Guy (Ryan Reynolds), who warns her that the end of the world is nigh. When the Croods' cave is destroyed, the family is forced on a journey into a strange new world where Grug's rules clash with Guy's techniques for survival.\n\nThe Croods is a formulaic movie that sticks to a traditional hero's journey and relies on typical archetypes, but it's elevated by the writing and direction of Kirk DeMicco and How to Train Your Dragon's Chris Sanders. Like Sanders' previous work, The Croods focuses on a family's dynamic and relationships. This time, the focus is on a protective father who wants to protect his family physically and protect his daughter from a member of the opposite sex who suddenly challenges his position as the alpha male. While the trailers and first half of the movie made is seem Eep was the main character, it's actually Grug who goes through the greatest change and learns the biggest lessons.\n\nThe story is one about learning, exploring, and using one's intelligence. It also touches on the idea that it's unhealthy to live a sheltered life. But at times, the movie lays it on a bit too much with Guy and his "solutions" leaving Grug on the losing end.\n\nMost of the humour used in The Croods is very physical and slapstick oriented. Characters have Loony Toons levels of invincibility as they endure intense physical pain. This type of humour obviously appeals to fairly young children, but I would be lying if I said I did not laugh at the film at all. The Croods avoids using crude toilet humour to generate cheap laughs. There is not much in the way of verbal humour, but there are some running gags, and modernisms are kept to a minimum. They are still there but they are more putting modern products in a Stone Age setting, a little like The Flintstones, so they serve more as pop-cultural winks to adults.\n\nAs expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. It's quick and fluid, and the camera flows nicely as it follows the action. The Croods themselves have a seemingly unpleasant, bulky design to them but it actually works in the context of the film because the characters live in the wild, so big and broad makes sense. It is a little refreshing to see the main female character is not made out to be a stunning beauty, but rather someone who has been shaped by her environment. The beginning of the movie starts with in dry, mono-coloured landscapes before we get to see the bright colours of the jungle and continually seeing the weird creature reminiscence of designs of Sanders' previous works.\n\nLike other animated movies these days, The Croods has a big name voice cast and they also do a decent, if standard job. No one disgraces themselves. Cage is an unusual choice, but he gives a strong performance. There is only one time when Cage is let off the handle; Unfortunately, that is when we are experiencing the most modernism the movie has to offer.\n\nThe Croods is not going to match the heights of DreamsWorks major hits of Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon. But it certainly does not belong with the dregs the studio has to offer. It does what it sets out to do: make a movie that will please children while attempting to give a positive message and some heart. It has an old-fashioned sense of humour that leads to a surprisingly enjoyable animated movie.\n\nPlease visit www.entertainmentfuse.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201412,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"caveman,journey,cave,survival,strict father","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi126265113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The world's very first prehistoric family goes on a road trip to an uncharted and fantastical world."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000092/","name":"John Cleese"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While the trailers and first half of the movie made is seem Eep was the main character, it's actually Grug who goes through the greatest change and learns the biggest lessons.\n\nThe story is one about learning, exploring, and using one's intelligence. It also touches on the idea that it's unhealthy to live a sheltered life. But at times, the movie lays it on a bit too much with Guy and his "solutions" leaving Grug on the losing end.\n\nMost of the humour used in The Croods is very physical and slapstick oriented. Characters have Loony Toons levels of invincibility as they endure intense physical pain. This type of humour obviously appeals to fairly young children, but I would be lying if I said I did not laugh at the film at all. The Croods avoids using crude toilet humour to generate cheap laughs. There is not much in the way of verbal humour, but there are some running gags, and modernisms are kept to a minimum. They are still there but they are more putting modern products in a Stone Age setting, a little like The Flintstones, so they serve more as pop-cultural winks to adults.\n\nAs expected from a DreamsWork movie the animation is fantastic. It's quick and fluid, and the camera flows nicely as it follows the action. The Croods themselves have a seemingly unpleasant, bulky design to them but it actually works in the context of the film because the characters live in the wild, so big and broad makes sense. It is a little refreshing to see the main female character is not made out to be a stunning beauty, but rather someone who has been shaped by her environment. The beginning of the movie starts with in dry, mono-coloured landscapes before we get to see the bright colours of the jungle and continually seeing the weird creature reminiscence of designs of Sanders' previous works.\n\nLike other animated movies these days, The Croods has a big name voice cast and they also do a decent, if standard job. No one disgraces themselves. Cage is an unusual choice, but he gives a strong performance. There is only one time when Cage is let off the handle; Unfortunately, that is when we are experiencing the most modernism the movie has to offer.\n\nThe Croods is not going to match the heights of DreamsWorks major hits of Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, and How to Train Your Dragon. But it certainly does not belong with the dregs the studio has to offer. It does what it sets out to do: make a movie that will please children while attempting to give a positive message and some heart. It has an old-fashioned sense of humour that leads to a surprisingly enjoyable animated movie.\n\nPlease visit www.entertainmentfuse.com","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201412,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"caveman,journey,cave,survival,strict father","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi126265113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTUzOTQ2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1ODIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The world's very first prehistoric family goes on a road trip to an uncharted and fantastical world.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210320/","name":"Kirk DeMicco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000092/","name":"John Cleese"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Protagonists of the series' longest-serving cast members that were not there when the series ended lasted far longer than the ones that replaced them. Interesting and overlong TV series dealing with investigation of heinous crimes presented from the perspectives of an expert police force and the prosecutors who accuse at criminal court . As in the criminal justice system, the people are represented by two separate, yet equally important groups : the police, who investigate crime and the district attorneys, who prosecute the offenders. These are their stories . As the toughest cases requires the toughest justice when dealing with the worst criminals meet the people who deal with them on their level. Long running TV drama produced by Dick Wolf, Warren Leight ,Rene Balcer , Arthur Fornier ,Ted Kotcheff and usual musical score by Mike Post , it tells the stories of two different yet equally important teams , the main : the cops who investigate crimes , carried out by the law enforcement and the public attorney at law who prosecute the offenders . The matter is then taken over by the prosecutors of the Manhatten District Attorney's office, who discuss deals and plea bargains, prepare the witnesses and evidence all whilst conducting the people's case in the trial of the accused. Dealing with the cops pursue the delinquents and the subsequent criminal justice system with spectacular trials . In NYC the dedicated detectives that investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite special of expert policemen . In the complex process of determining guilt and innocence, lives often hang in the balance.\n\nNice show that follows a murder , from two separate vantage points, the police investigation and the prosecution in court , including judge , jury , solicitor and prosecutor ; it delves into the more ominous offenses and grisly killings , investigating the crimes committed in NYC , usually adapted from current headlines, . Many people mistake this to mean that they are based on real events. In reality, the slogan is referring to the show's practice of coming up with stories that are partially inspired by recent headlines.. Both teams , Cops and Prosecutors , work together as well as with the Medical Examiners Office, Crime Lab and Police and District Attorney psychologists or psychiatrists. At the same time the protagonists are attemting to balance the consequences of the investigations on their own lives .\n\nThe series displays great actors , many of the actors on Law &amp; Order were also regular cast members on HBO series The Wire .

There may have been a handful of good (or decent) film noirs recently, but the bad outnumber them by about 100 to 1.\n\nI went into Carl Franklin's "Out of Time" with a certain amount of interest--I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew that it was a crime thriller/film noir about a guy who gets caught up in some type of crime, but other than that I really had no idea what the film was like. It hadn't gotten extremely good reviews (although most of them were at least positive), and that lowered my expectations a bit. I had finally come to expect a fairly decent thriller with illogical plot holes and a boring pace.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nWith a back-to-back viewing of David Spade's "Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star" and "Out of Time," there was a nice contrast going, which may explain why I enjoyed the film so very much. But there's one thing for certain--it's a lot cleverer than most films of its kind.\n\nMatt Whitlock (Denzel Washington) is running out of time. He's been framed for murder and has to cover his tracks before the clues start to pile up against him. And there are a lot of clues pointing not only in his direction, but directly at him.\n\nMatt is the police chief of a small town in Florida. Nobody suspects him. But he is sole beneficiary on the female victim's life insurance claim. And right before she died, Matt took over $400,000 worth of confiscated drug money and planned to run off with her. Nobody knew they were having an affair because she was a married woman and they were keeping their romantic adventures secret. She made Matt her beneficiary after being diagnosed with cancer--but now she's been discovered dead in a fire with her husband, the money gone, and all the evidence points--as I said before--to him. Fortunately, the police officials haven't picked up any traces. Yet. So, in a frantic race for time, Matt has to cover up all his tracks before the find out.\n\nThe doctor who diagnosed her cancer is gone. The money is gone. Matt's ex-wife (Eva Mendes) is bent on finding the killer, and sooner or later she'll figure out that Matt was having an affair, that he had a motive to kill (over 1,000,000 dollars), etc. But will she find out the real truth: That he is innocent?\n\nThis stuff's been done before; even I'll admit that. But this time it's great. Everything about this movie works, from the style (with all the vivid brightness of Florida portrayed in films such as "Scarface" or "Get Shorty") to the acting (Denzel strikes again!) to direction (Carl Franlin brings a distinct style to the film). From the opening credits I had a big smile on my face. This was a pleasant twist on film noir.\n\nAdmittedly the first half hour is rather slow. I almost came close to giving the film a negative review. But then the chain of events rolled in like a one-two punch; fast, furious, and everything you could wish for in a mystery. And, unlike some films, when you stop to take a look at the plot twists in "Out of Time"...they actually make sense.\n\nDenzel Washington is one of the best actors in Hollywood; he can lift any film out of mediocrity, including that underrated supernatural thriller "Fallen" with John Goodman. He is simply amazing, always able to bring a sense of realism to his roles, and he does this in "Out of Time"--I never doubted his role for a minute. That's pretty rare.\n\nI would say that "Out of Time" is one of the best films of the year. It seems real, with likable characters portrayed by a strong cast, including John Billinglsey as Chae, Matt's best friend who shows up when he's needed the most. In retrospect, a lot of these characters seem pretty typical and routine. But when I was watching the film, it seemed extremely realistic and convincing. That's always a good sign.\n\n"Out of Time" is rated PG-13 for some sexuality, violence, and language.

There may have been a handful of good (or decent) film noirs recently, but the bad outnumber them by about 100 to 1.\n\nI went into Carl Franklin's "Out of Time" with a certain amount of interest--I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew that it was a crime thriller/film noir about a guy who gets caught up in some type of crime, but other than that I really had no idea what the film was like. It hadn't gotten extremely good reviews (although most of them were at least positive), and that lowered my expectations a bit. I had finally come to expect a fairly decent thriller with illogical plot holes and a boring pace.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nWith a back-to-back viewing of David Spade's "Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star" and "Out of Time," there was a nice contrast going, which may explain why I enjoyed the film so very much. But there's one thing for certain--it's a lot cleverer than most films of its kind.\n\nMatt Whitlock (Denzel Washington) is running out of time. He's been framed for murder and has to cover his tracks before the clues start to pile up against him. And there are a lot of clues pointing not only in his direction, but directly at him.\n\nMatt is the police chief of a small town in Florida. Nobody suspects him. But he is sole beneficiary on the female victim's life insurance claim. And right before she died, Matt took over $400,000 worth of confiscated drug money and planned to run off with her. Nobody knew they were having an affair because she was a married woman and they were keeping their romantic adventures secret. She made Matt her beneficiary after being diagnosed with cancer--but now she's been discovered dead in a fire with her husband, the money gone, and all the evidence points--as I said before--to him. Fortunately, the police officials haven't picked up any traces. Yet. So, in a frantic race for time, Matt has to cover up all his tracks before the find out.\n\nThe doctor who diagnosed her cancer is gone. The money is gone. Matt's ex-wife (Eva Mendes) is bent on finding the killer, and sooner or later she'll figure out that Matt was having an affair, that he had a motive to kill (over 1,000,000 dollars), etc. But will she find out the real truth: That he is innocent?\n\nThis stuff's been done before; even I'll admit that. But this time it's great. Everything about this movie works, from the style (with all the vivid brightness of Florida portrayed in films such as "Scarface" or "Get Shorty") to the acting (Denzel strikes again!) to direction (Carl Franlin brings a distinct style to the film). From the opening credits I had a big smile on my face. This was a pleasant twist on film noir.\n\nAdmittedly the first half hour is rather slow.

There may have been a handful of good (or decent) film noirs recently, but the bad outnumber them by about 100 to 1.\n\nI went into Carl Franklin's "Out of Time" with a certain amount of interest--I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew that it was a crime thriller/film noir about a guy who gets caught up in some type of crime, but other than that I really had no idea what the film was like. It hadn't gotten extremely good reviews (although most of them were at least positive), and that lowered my expectations a bit. I had finally come to expect a fairly decent thriller with illogical plot holes and a boring pace.\n\nI was wrong.\n\nWith a back-to-back viewing of David Spade's "Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star" and "Out of Time," there was a nice contrast going, which may explain why I enjoyed the film so very much. But there's one thing for certain--it's a lot cleverer than most films of its kind.\n\nMatt Whitlock (Denzel Washington) is running out of time. He's been framed for murder and has to cover his tracks before the clues start to pile up against him. And there are a lot of clues pointing not only in his direction, but directly at him.\n\nMatt is the police chief of a small town in Florida. Nobody suspects him. But he is sole beneficiary on the female victim's life insurance claim. And right before she died, Matt took over $400,000 worth of confiscated drug money and planned to run off with her. Nobody knew they were having an affair because she was a married woman and they were keeping their romantic adventures secret. She made Matt her beneficiary after being diagnosed with cancer--but now she's been discovered dead in a fire with her husband, the money gone, and all the evidence points--as I said before--to him. Fortunately, the police officials haven't picked up any traces. Yet. So, in a frantic race for time, Matt has to cover up all his tracks before the find out.\n\nThe doctor who diagnosed her cancer is gone. The money is gone. Matt's ex-wife (Eva Mendes) is bent on finding the killer, and sooner or later she'll figure out that Matt was having an affair, that he had a motive to kill (over 1,000,000 dollars), etc. But will she find out the real truth: That he is innocent?\n\nThis stuff's been done before; even I'll admit that. But this time it's great. Everything about this movie works, from the style (with all the vivid brightness of Florida portrayed in films such as "Scarface" or "Get Shorty") to the acting (Denzel strikes again!) to direction (Carl Franlin brings a distinct style to the film). From the opening credits I had a big smile on my face. This was a pleasant twist on film noir.\n\nAdmittedly the first half hour is rather slow. I almost came close to giving the film a negative review. But then the chain of events rolled in like a one-two punch; fast, furious, and everything you could wish for in a mystery. And, unlike some films, when you stop to take a look at the plot twists in "Out of Time"...they actually make sense.\n\nDenzel Washington is one of the best actors in Hollywood; he can lift any film out of mediocrity, including that underrated supernatural thriller "Fallen" with John Goodman.

If this brings to mind the classic films "The Gauntlet" (Clint Eastwood), "Midnight Run" (Di Nero) or even "Silence of the Lambs" (Anthony Hopkins), then you know what I'm talking about when I say "great story". Similarly the acting is fantastic; you can't go wrong with Denzel Washington who has a way of raising the bar for all actors on a production. My one big problem, as a couple other reviewers mentioned, was the jarring, unnecessarily shaky camera and rapid fire edits that upstage the power of this film.\n\nRyan Reynolds plays the rookie "Matt" who's basically just a housekeeper at a CIA safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. One day they bring in "Frost" (Denzel Washington) who is basically James Bond with a bad attitude. One thing leads to another, bodies pile up, and Matt finds himself attempting to bring in Frost all by himself, despite a few armies of thugs &amp; spies hot on their trail.\n\nWhat makes this film work, much like in "Silence of the Lambs" is the dynamic between the fresh faced rookie and the wise Mr. Miagi prisoner. As events unfold, we see a pupil/teacher relationship develop even though the teacher is supposedly the bad guy. Ryan Reynolds, just like Jodie Foster in Lambs, pulls this off perfectly by seeming young &amp; inexperienced without seeming stupid. On the teacher side we have the excellent Denzel Washington who, just like Anthony Hopkins, conveys a magnetic aura of authority and control, even though he's the one in handcuffs (or in Lambs, a restraining hockey mask). Of course "Safe House" is more of a fast paced action flick than the slow psychological "Silence of the Lambs", and that leads me to my criticism.\n\nThis is just a personal opinion, but I feel like the hyper chaotic camera work and ADD edits killed a great opportunity for a powerful presentation. Note to directors: when you have a colossus like Denzel Washington in front of the camera, just tell your camera man to chill. Tell the gang in the editing room to put down the scissors. Just let the talent speak for itself.\n\nInstead--I'm not exaggerating here--I started counting at least 1 cut every 2 seconds. And even when the camera was given more time, it would be constantly shaking, zooming in &amp; out, darting about the room like a paranoid crack addict looking for a Starbucks caffè latte. I realize that this was a conscious stylistic choice, and definitely this chaotic style works to elevate bad productions to passable. But when your underlying material is GOOD, then why distract the audience with camera theatrics?\n\nOk I'm done with my opinion. Back to the facts. This is a good movie. It has a great story. These are great actors. Regardless of how you prefer your cameras &amp; edits, it's worth checking out."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":210424,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As events unfold, we see a pupil/teacher relationship develop even though the teacher is supposedly the bad guy. Ryan Reynolds, just like Jodie Foster in Lambs, pulls this off perfectly by seeming young &amp; inexperienced without seeming stupid. On the teacher side we have the excellent Denzel Washington who, just like Anthony Hopkins, conveys a magnetic aura of authority and control, even though he's the one in handcuffs (or in Lambs, a restraining hockey mask). Of course "Safe House" is more of a fast paced action flick than the slow psychological "Silence of the Lambs", and that leads me to my criticism.\n\nThis is just a personal opinion, but I feel like the hyper chaotic camera work and ADD edits killed a great opportunity for a powerful presentation. Note to directors: when you have a colossus like Denzel Washington in front of the camera, just tell your camera man to chill. Tell the gang in the editing room to put down the scissors. Just let the talent speak for itself.\n\nInstead--I'm not exaggerating here--I started counting at least 1 cut every 2 seconds. And even when the camera was given more time, it would be constantly shaking, zooming in &amp; out, darting about the room like a paranoid crack addict looking for a Starbucks caffè latte. I realize that this was a conscious stylistic choice, and definitely this chaotic style works to elevate bad productions to passable. But when your underlying material is GOOD, then why distract the audience with camera theatrics?\n\nOk I'm done with my opinion. Back to the facts. This is a good movie. It has a great story. These are great actors. Regardless of how you prefer your cameras &amp; edits, it's worth checking out.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":210424,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If this brings to mind the classic films "The Gauntlet" (Clint Eastwood), "Midnight Run" (Di Nero) or even "Silence of the Lambs" (Anthony Hopkins), then you know what I'm talking about when I say "great story". Similarly the acting is fantastic; you can't go wrong with Denzel Washington who has a way of raising the bar for all actors on a production. My one big problem, as a couple other reviewers mentioned, was the jarring, unnecessarily shaky camera and rapid fire edits that upstage the power of this film.\n\nRyan Reynolds plays the rookie "Matt" who's basically just a housekeeper at a CIA safe house in Cape Town, South Africa. One day they bring in "Frost" (Denzel Washington) who is basically James Bond with a bad attitude. One thing leads to another, bodies pile up, and Matt finds himself attempting to bring in Frost all by himself, despite a few armies of thugs &amp; spies hot on their trail.\n\nWhat makes this film work, much like in "Silence of the Lambs" is the dynamic between the fresh faced rookie and the wise Mr. Miagi prisoner. As events unfold, we see a pupil/teacher relationship develop even though the teacher is supposedly the bad guy. Ryan Reynolds, just like Jodie Foster in Lambs, pulls this off perfectly by seeming young &amp; inexperienced without seeming stupid. On the teacher side we have the excellent Denzel Washington who, just like Anthony Hopkins, conveys a magnetic aura of authority and control, even though he's the one in handcuffs (or in Lambs, a restraining hockey mask). Of course "Safe House" is more of a fast paced action flick than the slow psychological "Silence of the Lambs", and that leads me to my criticism.\n\nThis is just a personal opinion, but I feel like the hyper chaotic camera work and ADD edits killed a great opportunity for a powerful presentation. Note to directors: when you have a colossus like Denzel Washington in front of the camera, just tell your camera man to chill. Tell the gang in the editing room to put down the scissors. Just let the talent speak for itself.\n\nInstead--I'm not exaggerating here--I started counting at least 1 cut every 2 seconds. And even when the camera was given more time, it would be constantly shaking, zooming in &amp; out, darting about the room like a paranoid crack addict looking for a Starbucks caffè latte. I realize that this was a conscious stylistic choice, and definitely this chaotic style works to elevate bad productions to passable. But when your underlying material is GOOD, then why distract the audience with camera theatrics?\n\nOk I'm done with my opinion. Back to the facts. This is a good movie. It has a great story. These are great actors. Regardless of how you prefer your cameras &amp; edits, it's worth checking out."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":210424,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Both this film and Michael Bay's "The Rock" received the Criterion treatment at one time. And while both are very enjoyable films, do they really belong with Criterion? I feel that by merely being released by them, there is an added importance stamped on the film.\n\nBut as far as guilty pleasures go, this is a fun and entertaining film.

One of the best war-based movies ever","reviewBody":"I like Kubrick's stuff. Generally any movie he directed was several notches, in quality terms, above any other director (particularly those working nowdays). Does `Full Metal Jacket' continue to show the mastermind behind `2001', `The Shining' and `Dr. Strangelove'? Yup, it does.\n\nAs plots go. there isn't much here. I don't particularly care because the script makes up for it. `Full Metal Jacket' is very much a movie of two halves - the first half dealing with a group of conscripts in training at military camp and the hardships they endure under their `hard-as-nails' instructor. The second half is about their exploits in Vietnam itself. Fights? In 'Nam? Haven't we seen all that before? Yes, but rarely with such an experienced hand at work. And it's the camp scenes that are so wonderful.\n\nGustav Hasford et. Al. have produced an excellent script, particularly for the opening hour. There's barely a moment's pause before you're thrown into the screaming face of Sergeant Hartman. He's hurling abuse at his new recruits with lines so forceful and sharp they'll have you gasping in shock while simultaneously laughing in incredulity. It's the way the script runs in without a pause for breath that helps so wonderfully - and the fact that it's so powerful. It's never just about one-liners from a sergeant, it's also telling a story about how humans work under these conditions. The first half is about how they suffer under their own at home (and very well told it is too), the second half about the human condition under the duress of war. It's an interesting comparison, and a tale well told. The battle may lack some sort of overall context or resolution, but then I feel that's in keeping with the movie - it's about the individual, and not the war, and such elements cannot be easily quantified.\n\nAll the characters have a grounded `real world' feel to them, due to both the material and the versatility of the actors. R. Lee Emery is viciously delightful as the manic Sergeant Hartman, while managing to add occasional touches of humanity and a `this is for your own good' attitude through subtle gestures. Matthew Modine is the amiable lead, Private Joker, and as such balances the hard and soft edges admirably (if not spectacularly). The other stand out though is Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle, the recruit picked upon by Hartman and the other cadets. There's a wonderful innocence about him in the beginning, which transforms into a frightening hardening of his soul later on. The evil/beyond-hope look he gives later on (anyone who has seen the movie will know the one I mean), remains as the most frightening look I've ever seen depicted onscreen. All in all the cast accredit themselves well here.\n\nAnd so to the direction. It's Kubrick. It's good. Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. There's some lovely use of filters (that haunting blue). There's a brilliant subtle score, that's eerie when used, but never intrusive. There's a very good command of pace - the viewer is never left idle or bored, and the story (particularly in the tremendous first half) flows along smoothly. Great touches abound throughout - check out the many examples, such as the opening scene of Hartman marching right up to the recruits (and to the camera), spitting and screaming vindictive comments, almost as if at the viewer. Some may criticise the almost disconnected feeling you have in the battle scenes towards the end, but I found their stillness, their quietness, and raw power, far more effective than the flash-bang wizardry employed in tripe such as `We Were Heroes'. I can blather on about Kubrick for ages. so I'll stop now.\n\nIs `Full Metal Jacket' perfect? Not quite because of the `two halves' syndrome. Although they do contrast and complement one another, the first half is very much the stronger half. The second feels weaker against it. In and of itself the second half would normally be regarded well, but it doesn't have the visceral power that the first does. I love both bits, but I do love one bit more. This makes the movie suffer just a little. There's so much to like here though that I can't criticise too much - and so much to cherish (especially in the lines delved out). Once more the main man succeeds.

One of the best war-based movies ever","reviewBody":"I like Kubrick's stuff. Generally any movie he directed was several notches, in quality terms, above any other director (particularly those working nowdays). Does `Full Metal Jacket' continue to show the mastermind behind `2001', `The Shining' and `Dr. Strangelove'? Yup, it does.\n\nAs plots go. there isn't much here. I don't particularly care because the script makes up for it. `Full Metal Jacket' is very much a movie of two halves - the first half dealing with a group of conscripts in training at military camp and the hardships they endure under their `hard-as-nails' instructor. The second half is about their exploits in Vietnam itself. Fights? In 'Nam? Haven't we seen all that before? Yes, but rarely with such an experienced hand at work. And it's the camp scenes that are so wonderful.\n\nGustav Hasford et. Al. have produced an excellent script, particularly for the opening hour. There's barely a moment's pause before you're thrown into the screaming face of Sergeant Hartman. He's hurling abuse at his new recruits with lines so forceful and sharp they'll have you gasping in shock while simultaneously laughing in incredulity. It's the way the script runs in without a pause for breath that helps so wonderfully - and the fact that it's so powerful. It's never just about one-liners from a sergeant, it's also telling a story about how humans work under these conditions. The first half is about how they suffer under their own at home (and very well told it is too), the second half about the human condition under the duress of war. It's an interesting comparison, and a tale well told. The battle may lack some sort of overall context or resolution, but then I feel that's in keeping with the movie - it's about the individual, and not the war, and such elements cannot be easily quantified.\n\nAll the characters have a grounded `real world' feel to them, due to both the material and the versatility of the actors. R. Lee Emery is viciously delightful as the manic Sergeant Hartman, while managing to add occasional touches of humanity and a `this is for your own good' attitude through subtle gestures. Matthew Modine is the amiable lead, Private Joker, and as such balances the hard and soft edges admirably (if not spectacularly). The other stand out though is Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle, the recruit picked upon by Hartman and the other cadets. There's a wonderful innocence about him in the beginning, which transforms into a frightening hardening of his soul later on. The evil/beyond-hope look he gives later on (anyone who has seen the movie will know the one I mean), remains as the most frightening look I've ever seen depicted onscreen. All in all the cast accredit themselves well here.\n\nAnd so to the direction. It's Kubrick. It's good. Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. There's some lovely use of filters (that haunting blue). There's a brilliant subtle score, that's eerie when used, but never intrusive. There's a very good command of pace - the viewer is never left idle or bored, and the story (particularly in the tremendous first half) flows along smoothly. Great touches abound throughout - check out the many examples, such as the opening scene of Hartman marching right up to the recruits (and to the camera), spitting and screaming vindictive comments, almost as if at the viewer. Some may criticise the almost disconnected feeling you have in the battle scenes towards the end, but I found their stillness, their quietness, and raw power, far more effective than the flash-bang wizardry employed in tripe such as `We Were Heroes'. I can blather on about Kubrick for ages. so I'll stop now.\n\nIs `Full Metal Jacket' perfect? Not quite because of the `two halves' syndrome. Although they do contrast and complement one another, the first half is very much the stronger half. The second feels weaker against it. In and of itself the second half would normally be regarded well, but it doesn't have the visceral power that the first does. I love both bits, but I do love one bit more. This makes the movie suffer just a little. There's so much to like here though that I can't criticise too much - and so much to cherish (especially in the lines delved out).

One of the best war-based movies ever","reviewBody":"I like Kubrick's stuff. Generally any movie he directed was several notches, in quality terms, above any other director (particularly those working nowdays). Does `Full Metal Jacket' continue to show the mastermind behind `2001', `The Shining' and `Dr. Strangelove'? Yup, it does.\n\nAs plots go. there isn't much here. I don't particularly care because the script makes up for it. `Full Metal Jacket' is very much a movie of two halves - the first half dealing with a group of conscripts in training at military camp and the hardships they endure under their `hard-as-nails' instructor. The second half is about their exploits in Vietnam itself. Fights? In 'Nam? Haven't we seen all that before? Yes, but rarely with such an experienced hand at work. And it's the camp scenes that are so wonderful.\n\nGustav Hasford et. Al. have produced an excellent script, particularly for the opening hour. There's barely a moment's pause before you're thrown into the screaming face of Sergeant Hartman. He's hurling abuse at his new recruits with lines so forceful and sharp they'll have you gasping in shock while simultaneously laughing in incredulity. It's the way the script runs in without a pause for breath that helps so wonderfully - and the fact that it's so powerful. It's never just about one-liners from a sergeant, it's also telling a story about how humans work under these conditions. The first half is about how they suffer under their own at home (and very well told it is too), the second half about the human condition under the duress of war. It's an interesting comparison, and a tale well told. The battle may lack some sort of overall context or resolution, but then I feel that's in keeping with the movie - it's about the individual, and not the war, and such elements cannot be easily quantified.\n\nAll the characters have a grounded `real world' feel to them, due to both the material and the versatility of the actors. R. Lee Emery is viciously delightful as the manic Sergeant Hartman, while managing to add occasional touches of humanity and a `this is for your own good' attitude through subtle gestures. Matthew Modine is the amiable lead, Private Joker, and as such balances the hard and soft edges admirably (if not spectacularly). The other stand out though is Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle, the recruit picked upon by Hartman and the other cadets. There's a wonderful innocence about him in the beginning, which transforms into a frightening hardening of his soul later on. The evil/beyond-hope look he gives later on (anyone who has seen the movie will know the one I mean), remains as the most frightening look I've ever seen depicted onscreen. All in all the cast accredit themselves well here.\n\nAnd so to the direction. It's Kubrick. It's good. Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. There's some lovely use of filters (that haunting blue). There's a brilliant subtle score, that's eerie when used, but never intrusive. There's a very good command of pace - the viewer is never left idle or bored, and the story (particularly in the tremendous first half) flows along smoothly. Great touches abound throughout - check out the many examples, such as the opening scene of Hartman marching right up to the recruits (and to the camera), spitting and screaming vindictive comments, almost as if at the viewer. Some may criticise the almost disconnected feeling you have in the battle scenes towards the end, but I found their stillness, their quietness, and raw power, far more effective than the flash-bang wizardry employed in tripe such as `We Were Heroes'. I can blather on about Kubrick for ages. so I'll stop now.\n\nIs `Full Metal Jacket' perfect? Not quite because of the `two halves' syndrome. Although they do contrast and complement one another, the first half is very much the stronger half. The second feels weaker against it. In and of itself the second half would normally be regarded well, but it doesn't have the visceral power that the first does. I love both bits, but I do love one bit more. This makes the movie suffer just a little. There's so much to like here though that I can't criticise too much - and so much to cherish (especially in the lines delved out). Once more the main man succeeds. Definetely worth seeing. 9/10.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":699104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1987-07-10","keywords":"military,vietnam war,drill instructor,u.s. marine,boot camp","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Full Metal Jacket - Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3225663513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU0ZmYwNmUtMzc2Mi00ZjYxLWE2MjctY2Q1NjE1NmZiOTJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGU0ZmYwNmUtMzc2Mi00ZjYxLWE2MjctY2Q1NjE1NmZiOTJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000546/","name":"Matthew Modine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000388/","name":"R.

The length I believe to be the biggest drawback in this movie. In my opinion the movie should of been closer to the length of The Watchmen to completely illustrate the complexity and brilliance that the Green Lantern universe really is.\n\nFor me, I believed the hype going into this movie, I had a completely closed mind and fully expected this movie to be as one critic described it "Green Lantern, The worst comic book movie ever made". Honestly I have to say that I'm glad that I read that review before viewing this movie as it made it all that sweeter when the movie went beyond all I thought it would be and greatly impressed me.\n\nI'm sorry that this movie was received so badly because the chances of seeing a sequel have dropped and in a universe where anything is possible I think we will miss out on all that the Green Lantern franchise could be.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":271324,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Unfortunately Green Lantern came at a time when comic inspired novels have been done almost to death. While most done quite brilliantly (most being the operative word here) Green Lantern I believe did not live up to the expectations we now have of comic adaptations.\n\nRyan Reynolds as Hal Jordan was a great choice for the role of The Green Lantern, the character arc while helping you to understand the character of Hal Jordan was sufficient I do believe they could of well exceeded what they did.\n\nFor a story as immense as the Green Lantern I believe that the close to two hours was to short to completely describe and help understand the Green Lantern universe. The length I believe to be the biggest drawback in this movie. In my opinion the movie should of been closer to the length of The Watchmen to completely illustrate the complexity and brilliance that the Green Lantern universe really is.\n\nFor me, I believed the hype going into this movie, I had a completely closed mind and fully expected this movie to be as one critic described it "Green Lantern, The worst comic book movie ever made". Honestly I have to say that I'm glad that I read that review before viewing this movie as it made it all that sweeter when the movie went beyond all I thought it would be and greatly impressed me.\n\nI'm sorry that this movie was received so badly because the chances of seeing a sequel have dropped and in a universe where anything is possible I think we will miss out on all that the Green Lantern franchise could be.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":271324,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Adventures were limited by imagination, and Summer days were transformed into magic. "Zathura", directed by Jon Favreau, based on a book by Chris Van Allsburg, came knocking on my door and invited me to come out and play.\n\nAuthor/Artist, Van Allsburg has a wonderful gift. His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His vision is firmly planted in a realm of childhood experiences. More illustration than words, his books evoke worlds of wonder. The last movie based on one of his stories was, "The Polar Express" directed by Zemeckis. It is making it's re appearance as a seasonal movie. It is well worth seeing, and if you can find it in IMAX 3-D, it is phenomenal.\n\nVan Allsburg's book, "Jumanji" was filmed less successfully back in 1995. It failed because it could not find the right tone. Zathura nails it. Both books share the same plot device; Children find a board game that transports them into the game. Cards are drawn that effect their fate and their surroundings. The only way to escape the perils of the game, is to play it through. Jumanji was a jungle game and Zathura is a space adventure.\n\nWhat elevates this film is the believable interactions of the two young players. Jonah Bobo plays the six year old Danny, who is always getting in the way of his older brother, ten year old Walter, played by Josh Hutcherson. Danny is looking for friendship and attention from his brother, who in turn considers Danny to be a pest and a nuisance, competing for the attention of their recently divorced father, played by Tim Robbins.\n\nThe boys have an older sister Lisa, played by Kristen Stewart. She is living in a world of her own, between her preening and dating, the boys hardly see her. Although she does join the game late in the film, for most of the film she is cryogenically indisposed.\n\nThe Game itself is a marvel of brightly painted tin and wind up gears. To play is simple, wind it up, push a button and watch a number come up, this determines the number of spaces your playing piece will take. Two rockets chase each other around the twisting path. After your piece moves, a card pops up. The card describes the action to follow. Danny draws the first card that says, "Meteor Shower, Take Evasive Action" and the game is on.\n\nThe movie is visually stunning. The discovery by the children, that their house has been transported to a location in outer space, hovering above a ring of meteors that encircle a large planet, is jaw dropping. The effects are real enough to imply danger, but logic is not a function of children's games, so it does not matter that oxygen, gravity and warmth still exist in the house, even as it is blasted apart by various forces.\n\nAlong the way the boys encounter a young astronaut played by Dax Shepard, who helps them out of perilous situations like battling engulfing black holes, and evading Fierce carnivorous lizards called Zorgons. Along the way the Astronaut teaches them lessons in brotherly cooperation, and even beguiles Lisa into sharing the adventure. \n\nWhile funny and exciting, it is never preachy, Zathura is intelligently written and directed, this is a great family film. I give it **** out of five stars.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The form of the movie corresponds to its content. Someone smart was behind this.\n\nThis is one of two movies I saw this week that exploits post 9-11 American notions of self. We need to be reassured that we are good, that the system is fundamentally healthy, that one person can make a difference and so on.\n\nThe other movie was 'Seabiscuit' which pulls on the Democrat message: little guy against fat capitalism, struggling nation getting help from government policy, all people are essentially kindhearted, wounded people and persons coming back and winning and so one there too.\n\nThis film pulls on the Republican end: lightweight and lowbrow, celebrates the simple platitude as truth, respect for the stupid but well-meaning. Even features Lincoln and has a female Clarence Thomas type.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":63495,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-17","keywords":"congresswoman,beauty salon,transvestism,the white house,washington monument washington d.c.","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2581971225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc2ZjhlYjMtODMxOS00OWE3LWIzMzUtZjJmNzFmNjQ2Zjk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDc2ZjhlYjMtODMxOS00OWE3LWIzMzUtZjJmNzFmNjQ2Zjk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000702/","name":"Reese Witherspoon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000398/","name":"Sally Field","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0627878/","name":"Bob Newhart"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379237/","name":"Charles Herman-Wurmfeld"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093810/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0081041/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0113005/","name":"Amanda Brown","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0013996/","name":"Eve Ahlert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0236881/","name":"Dennis Drake"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'll try my best to be objective in this review, though. The plot is good, and as the film barely takes 90 minutes it's fairly fast-paced(well, for a Jim Carrey comedy, anyway); I don't think there ever passes 5 minutes without one single joke. The acting is fairly good; Jim Carrey is in his element, so it's no surprise that he's good, but I did find both Maura Tierney and Cary Elwes pretty good too. I know that Elwes is English, not American, and after seeing another movie in which he has a strong English accent(Robin Hood: Men in Tights), I was impressed at how well he does American parts as well. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is great, partly because it's, well, Carrey, but also because unlike some of Carrey's previous roles, this is fairly "clean", so teenagers and some kids will be able to enjoy it as well. The theme of the film is great; I mean, we all know that we lie several times a day(heck, it's even been scientifically proved), but what about if we, for one whole day, couldn't tell one single lie? Great theme, provokes some thought and is executed fairly well in the film, though I do think it could have been done a tad better. Overall, I don't have any major complaints with the film though; I guess it could be argued that most of what Carrey does in this film, the comedy and all, is stuff he's done before, but that's OK; it's not any less entertaining here, regardless of the fact that we've seen it(or something similar to it) earlier. The dialog is great, with some very memorable and quotable lines. All in all, a typical Carrey film, which can be a good thing as well as bad; Carrey does exactly what you expect him to, and he's very entertaining and all, but it never transcends the standard level of the typical Carrey comedy. On a final note, I think this(as well as his other work) proves that Tom Shadyac is the best there is at bringing out Carrey's talents(he also directed Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Bruce Almighty). I recommend it to any fan of Jim Carrey and/or Tom Shadyac. 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":288855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT1H26M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'll try my best to be objective in this review, though. The plot is good, and as the film barely takes 90 minutes it's fairly fast-paced(well, for a Jim Carrey comedy, anyway); I don't think there ever passes 5 minutes without one single joke. The acting is fairly good; Jim Carrey is in his element, so it's no surprise that he's good, but I did find both Maura Tierney and Cary Elwes pretty good too. I know that Elwes is English, not American, and after seeing another movie in which he has a strong English accent(Robin Hood: Men in Tights), I was impressed at how well he does American parts as well. The characters are well-written and credible. The humor is great, partly because it's, well, Carrey, but also because unlike some of Carrey's previous roles, this is fairly "clean", so teenagers and some kids will be able to enjoy it as well. The theme of the film is great; I mean, we all know that we lie several times a day(heck, it's even been scientifically proved), but what about if we, for one whole day, couldn't tell one single lie? Great theme, provokes some thought and is executed fairly well in the film, though I do think it could have been done a tad better. Overall, I don't have any major complaints with the film though; I guess it could be argued that most of what Carrey does in this film, the comedy and all, is stuff he's done before, but that's OK; it's not any less entertaining here, regardless of the fact that we've seen it(or something similar to it) earlier. The dialog is great, with some very memorable and quotable lines. All in all, a typical Carrey film, which can be a good thing as well as bad; Carrey does exactly what you expect him to, and he's very entertaining and all, but it never transcends the standard level of the typical Carrey comedy. On a final note, I think this(as well as his other work) proves that Tom Shadyac is the best there is at bringing out Carrey's talents(he also directed Ace Ventura: Pet Detective and Bruce Almighty). I recommend it to any fan of Jim Carrey and/or Tom Shadyac. 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":288855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Actually, despite a lazy script full of nonstop crude and sex jokes, and moments that could be really awful, this movie is above the very low bar. Jack Black and Michael Cera take this bad material and make something mediocre out of it, which still isn't saying much.\n\nZed (Jack Black) is a gatherer who tries to fit in with the hunter clan, but he's just too silly for their tastes. Oh (Michael Cera) is also a gatherer and is a somewhat unpopular with the ladies. After an accident involving fire, this mismatched pair has to leave and they do through various pieces of biblical history, including meeting Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd), and meeting Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Abraham (Hank Azaria), who apparently had a thing for cutting foreskin. The movie is a hodge podge of scenes thrown together with very little plot, but by the end Zed and Oh have to save the lives of two girls from their village.\n\nJack Black and Michael Cera are pretty good here. Jack Black does his typical over the top stoner performance and Michael Cera gives the emotional boy performance. Even David Cross and Oliver Platt manage to squeeze some laughs out of their performances. But nobody really has a lot of material to work with, though at the same time the material isn't the worst out there. It's bad, and oftentimes relies on some outwardly sexual material. In fact, this is the least subtle PG-13 rated film I've seen where sexual or crude jokes are involved. This includes scenes of eating poop and throwing testicles. If something sexual happens, it's not only just implied, but it's flaunted.\n\nOne big problem is the lack of plot in the movie. It grows boring going from setpiece to setpiece, never establishing a real plot until the end, and despite being only around 100 minutes, it still feels way too long. The climax is ridiculous and quite boring, and this movie is too filled with scenes that aren't particularly horrible, but they aren't particularly funny, and all too often this movie is just a laugh free staring at the screen. It managed to attain quite consistent mediocrity, with some chuckles every once in a while. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't good either, by any means.\n\nMy rating: ** out of ****. 105 mins. PG-13 for crude sexual humor, drug use, and language.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94936,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-08-12","keywords":"horniness,sodom,cain and abel,biblical satire,prehistory","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Year One: Superbowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2134442777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjI0MDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzODkyMg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjI0MDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzODkyMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the Year One commercial which aired during the 2009 Superbowl."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085312/","name":"Jack Black"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1312575/","name":"Olivia Wilde"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035477/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1969144/","name":"Gene Stupnitsky"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1072409/","name":"Lee Eisenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nicholson and Hunt both won Oscars and they're simply great but Kinnear is no less effective as Nicholson gay neighbour. Plus that dog is amazing as well. This film really relies on great performances and there's no shortage of that here.\n\nAs Good As It Gets is also remarkably well written. So well defined characters and completely involving, you quite simply grow to love them and sympathize with their plight. Nicholson's remarks are terrific, each one very quotable (personal fav; I think of a man and I take away reason and accountability).\n\nDirection is first rate, Brooks made Terms of Endearment so it's well established that he's quite capable of making great films. As Good As It Gets is very nearly as good it gets.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":281445,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's not just a comedy, you can't quite label it a drama piece, it just is what it is; simply great.\n\nWhat works here so well are the actors and the script. Nicholson and Hunt both won Oscars and they're simply great but Kinnear is no less effective as Nicholson gay neighbour. Plus that dog is amazing as well. This film really relies on great performances and there's no shortage of that here.\n\nAs Good As It Gets is also remarkably well written. So well defined characters and completely involving, you quite simply grow to love them and sympathize with their plight. Nicholson's remarks are terrific, each one very quotable (personal fav; I think of a man and I take away reason and accountability).\n\nDirection is first rate, Brooks made Terms of Endearment so it's well established that he's quite capable of making great films. As Good As It Gets is very nearly as good it gets.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":281445,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT2H19M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie does at times become dream-like in its depiction of Victor's recreation of his youthful journey, and most certainly surreal, definitely bewildering in places for him, and the whole story is cleverly handled with wit and elegance. Well worth seeing, and I will give it a faultless 10/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12705,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Actually, despite a lazy script full of nonstop crude and sex jokes, and moments that could be really awful, this movie is above the very low bar. Jack Black and Michael Cera take this bad material and make something mediocre out of it, which still isn't saying much.\n\nZed (Jack Black) is a gatherer who tries to fit in with the hunter clan, but he's just too silly for their tastes. Oh (Michael Cera) is also a gatherer and is a somewhat unpopular with the ladies. After an accident involving fire, this mismatched pair has to leave and they do through various pieces of biblical history, including meeting Cain (David Cross) and Abel (Paul Rudd), and meeting Isaac (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) and Abraham (Hank Azaria), who apparently had a thing for cutting foreskin. The movie is a hodge podge of scenes thrown together with very little plot, but by the end Zed and Oh have to save the lives of two girls from their village.\n\nJack Black and Michael Cera are pretty good here. Jack Black does his typical over the top stoner performance and Michael Cera gives the emotional boy performance. Even David Cross and Oliver Platt manage to squeeze some laughs out of their performances. But nobody really has a lot of material to work with, though at the same time the material isn't the worst out there. It's bad, and oftentimes relies on some outwardly sexual material. In fact, this is the least subtle PG-13 rated film I've seen where sexual or crude jokes are involved. This includes scenes of eating poop and throwing testicles. If something sexual happens, it's not only just implied, but it's flaunted.\n\nOne big problem is the lack of plot in the movie. It grows boring going from setpiece to setpiece, never establishing a real plot until the end, and despite being only around 100 minutes, it still feels way too long. The climax is ridiculous and quite boring, and this movie is too filled with scenes that aren't particularly horrible, but they aren't particularly funny, and all too often this movie is just a laugh free staring at the screen. It managed to attain quite consistent mediocrity, with some chuckles every once in a while. It wasn't horrible, it just wasn't good either, by any means.\n\nMy rating: ** out of ****. 105 mins. PG-13 for crude sexual humor, drug use, and language.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94936,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-08-12","keywords":"horniness,sodom,cain and abel,biblical satire,prehistory","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Year One: Superbowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2134442777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjI0MDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzODkyMg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjI0MDMyOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzIzODkyMg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the Year One commercial which aired during the 2009 Superbowl."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085312/","name":"Jack Black"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1312575/","name":"Olivia Wilde"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035477/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1969144/","name":"Gene Stupnitsky"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1072409/","name":"Lee Eisenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like "Mr. Woodcock" and "Good Luck Chuck," movies with no real craft to any of their jokes.\n\n"Jessica Alba fell down!!! Ahahahahahaha!" \n\n"He yelled 'sex' really loud!!! Pssshhahahahahaaheheheheeee!" \n\nNo. Die.\n\nKnocked Up, on the other hand, is actually pretty clever most of the time. And even the movie's vulgarity isn't done in an over-the-top, simply-for-gross-out way (cite the fat bitch from Good Luck Chuck). It's what I guess you could call 'relevant vulgarity.' Anyway, the movie is extremely funny. Every joke is naturalistic, but not expected. The movie's characters are all convincing and multi-dimensional, and above all likable. Seth Rogan really does make the movie, though. He is hilarious, but he comes off more like a real nice, frank, down-to-Earth guy. Just the kind of guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with. The kind of guy you'd more than like to get smashed with. The kind of guy you'd really like to have ill advised unprotected sex with. The kind of guy you'd love to raise a bastard child with. Needless to say, he's the reason the movie works.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":355139,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now let's get one thing straight. Knocked Up is vulgar, absolutely it is, but is is not stupid. Stupid humor is crap like "Mr. Woodcock" and "Good Luck Chuck," movies with no real craft to any of their jokes.\n\n"Jessica Alba fell down!!! Ahahahahahaha!" \n\n"He yelled 'sex' really loud!!! Pssshhahahahahaaheheheheeee!" \n\nNo. Die.\n\nKnocked Up, on the other hand, is actually pretty clever most of the time. And even the movie's vulgarity isn't done in an over-the-top, simply-for-gross-out way (cite the fat bitch from Good Luck Chuck). It's what I guess you could call 'relevant vulgarity.' Anyway, the movie is extremely funny. Every joke is naturalistic, but not expected. The movie's characters are all convincing and multi-dimensional, and above all likable. Seth Rogan really does make the movie, though. He is hilarious, but he comes off more like a real nice, frank, down-to-Earth guy. Just the kind of guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with. The kind of guy you'd more than like to get smashed with. The kind of guy you'd really like to have ill advised unprotected sex with. The kind of guy you'd love to raise a bastard child with. Needless to say, he's the reason the movie works.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":355139,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The cast was great once again with Paul Walker returning to his role as Brian O'Connor and Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendes adding new character dynamics. Tyrese in particular was great. If there's one thing the first film lacked it's that there wasn't much humor. It was a very serious film and while that's great, Tyrese's character, Roman Pearce, added some great laughs at some unexpected moments. The cinematic effects were much better in this film also. The only negatives were that some of the action sequences were a little overboard (Dukes of Hazard jump for example) and the dialogue had too much street car jargon to the extent that some of it felt forced. "That Yenko will snap a speedo in 5 seconds" is an example of the type of dialogue that doesn't actually feel genuine in its placement in the film. Nonetheless, a really good movie with solid acting and great action.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The cast was great once again with Paul Walker returning to his role as Brian O'Connor and Tyrese Gibson and Eva Mendes adding new character dynamics. Tyrese in particular was great. If there's one thing the first film lacked it's that there wasn't much humor. It was a very serious film and while that's great, Tyrese's character, Roman Pearce, added some great laughs at some unexpected moments. The cinematic effects were much better in this film also. The only negatives were that some of the action sequences were a little overboard (Dukes of Hazard jump for example) and the dialogue had too much street car jargon to the extent that some of it felt forced. "That Yenko will snap a speedo in 5 seconds" is an example of the type of dialogue that doesn't actually feel genuine in its placement in the film. Nonetheless, a really good movie with solid acting and great action.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

To be honest, if it hadn't been for the return of Raze, I might not have given this a chance at all; Kevin Grevioux is just plain a bad-ass. That's his *real voice*!

While I would have liked more of him in this, I'm honest enough to admit that the entire 80 minute running time could have had him in every shot, and I'd still be saying that it's not enough. For Tatopoulos having relatively little experience at directing(I guess he got tired of being consultant for when giant mutated lizards attack), he does rather well. And this definitely has a *gorgeous* Gothic look, and the dark tone of the first two. The cinematography and editing are great, and the use of hand-held is effective, although several bits go by so fast that you can't tell what is going on. Nearly every(and certainly every lead) performance is impressive; Sheen continues the stellar work, Nighy(apart from being over the top at points) is marvelous, of course, and I wouldn't mind seeing Mitra be the lead in something else. I hadn't seen her in this large a part before, and she does well. The action is cool, intense and fun; of course, given that this is a prequel, you may miss the shoot-outs and car-chases of the prior 2 entries. With that said, the sword-fighting is great. The FX are excellent, and smoothly integrated. To its credit, at its core, this is a story about slaves rising up against their masters, and it does engage pretty well. There is plenty of brutal, bloody violence, a little sexuality(hot, though not graphic; and this has eye candy for both genders) and brief male, infant nudity in this. The DVD comes with an informative and amusing commentary track, three well-done featurettes of 9, 20 and 13 minutes length, respectively, a music video and a handful of trailers.

I recommend this to any fan of the franchise(and this is best watched after the others). 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153253,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Together they can be sublime. Look at "Ed Wood" and "Sweeney Todd" Here, well here they seem kind of lost. Everything is in over the top tones without getting to the root of anything. The performances are shrill and disconnected with the exception of the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter. The script is underwritten and the story is tired and unconvincing but in the present film going landscape it is more enjoyable than most others. I'm tempted to advise Mr. Burton and Mr.Depp to be a bit more daring in their intentions. We're all aware of Burton's visual wizardry and of Depp's remarkable beauty and talent, why not put all that at the service of something meaningful?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":251745,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It straddles the line between the two, existing somewhere equidistant from both. It is never too over-the-top for us to laugh out loud with it, nor is it ever truly scary enough to make us shiver.

The action is cool, intense and fun; of course, given that this is a prequel, you may miss the shoot-outs and car-chases of the prior 2 entries. With that said, the sword-fighting is great. The FX are excellent, and smoothly integrated. To its credit, at its core, this is a story about slaves rising up against their masters, and it does engage pretty well. There is plenty of brutal, bloody violence, a little sexuality(hot, though not graphic; and this has eye candy for both genders) and brief male, infant nudity in this. The DVD comes with an informative and amusing commentary track, three well-done featurettes of 9, 20 and 13 minutes length, respectively, a music video and a handful of trailers.

Together they can be sublime. Look at "Ed Wood" and "Sweeney Todd" Here, well here they seem kind of lost. Everything is in over the top tones without getting to the root of anything. The performances are shrill and disconnected with the exception of the wonderful Helena Bonham Carter. The script is underwritten and the story is tired and unconvincing but in the present film going landscape it is more enjoyable than most others. I'm tempted to advise Mr. Burton and Mr.Depp to be a bit more daring in their intentions. We're all aware of Burton's visual wizardry and of Depp's remarkable beauty and talent, why not put all that at the service of something meaningful?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":251745,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Lawrence Talbot (Benicio Del Toro) returns home after learning that his brother has disappeared.

Once home he learns that his brother was killed, and hears stories about a beast that might've caused it and that the Gypsies are to blame.

Anthony Hopkins has a few good lines which makes you think there is more to the story then what there really is. If you've seen the trailers, which give way too much away in my opinion, you will not be shocked where this movie eventually ends up going.

There are some interesting interpretations of the vampire myth as it relates to Christianity (not to give anything away)... explaining vampires' aversion to crosses and silver, among other things. The story is kind of all over the place... Dracula is resurrected in the year 2000 by a band of wayward thieves who mistakenly believe that the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing (Christopher Plummer) is hiding something really valuable in that hidden, underground vault. Van Helsing's estranged daughter is simultaneously having weird visions... her father has tried to keep her free from the family legacy for years... but you know IL' Dracula isn't going to let that go on. I could have done without a lot of the wise-ass one-liners from the heroic leading man (Jonny Lee Miller)... it tends to cheapen the whole story and dilute the tension. Still, the movie is a lot better than other recent vampire flicks.

There are some interesting interpretations of the vampire myth as it relates to Christianity (not to give anything away)... explaining vampires' aversion to crosses and silver, among other things. The story is kind of all over the place... Dracula is resurrected in the year 2000 by a band of wayward thieves who mistakenly believe that the mysterious Dr. Van Helsing (Christopher Plummer) is hiding something really valuable in that hidden, underground vault. Van Helsing's estranged daughter is simultaneously having weird visions... her father has tried to keep her free from the family legacy for years... but you know IL' Dracula isn't going to let that go on. I could have done without a lot of the wise-ass one-liners from the heroic leading man (Jonny Lee Miller)... it tends to cheapen the whole story and dilute the tension. Still, the movie is a lot better than other recent vampire flicks. I was a bit suspicious of the "Wes Craven Presents" that they tacked onto the title in a desperate ploy to attract an audience... but I think the movie is actually a lot better than 80% of the movies that Craven actually *does* direct. (I'm not much of a fan as you can probably guess.) Good flick...

Dallas. The Young and the Restless.  The Dukes of Hazzard.  He-Man.  The Greatest American Hero.  Airwolf.  Knight Rider.\n\nIn 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they did not commit.  They promptly escaped a maximum security stockade into the Los Angeles Underground.  Today, still wanted by the government, they exist as soldiers of fortune.  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...\n\nThe A-Team.\n\nWith a script any eight year old would love, the four members of the A-Team went off every week to somewhere in America to help someone who couldn't find help anywhere else.  They battled impossible odds (with impossible storylines) and managed to stay one step ahead of the law.  They were always predictable, heroic, and fun.  God bless the eighties, and long live TV Land.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35564,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Crime"],"datePublished":"1983-01-23","keywords":"gmc vandura,cult tv,good versus evil,mercenary,hero for hire","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000577/","name":"George Peppard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001558/","name":"Mr. T","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0776239/","name":"Dwight Schultz"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004798/","name":"Stephen J.

He's a surgeon from sophisticated, worldly London who moves to (fictional) Portwenn on the coast of Cornwall because he suddenly becomes ill at the sight of blood. This is not a good omen for a surgeon. He quits to become a general practitioner and he's satisfied, thanks very much, with checkups, prescriptions and referrals.\n\nThe foul-mannered, blunt-spoken Doc smugly considers himself above the crowd, but he soon learns he is really BELOW the crowd, out of step with Portwenn's eccentricities, value systems and peculiar burghers, who make the mere lunatics of London look normal by comparison.\n\nMartin Clunes is terrific in the lead role. He is a tall, charismatic and not exactly handsome actor who looks like he would be more comfortable playing cops and heavies. He is, instead, a consummate comic actor. His facial and physical comedy, his frequent bouts of exasperation and bewilderment, are things to behold. (Note: some wags have compared him to 'House,' from the popular TV drama of the same name. House is played by Hugh Laurie, another splendid Brit, and that's about where the comparison begins and ends. They are two very different characters in two very different shows.)\n\nPortwenn's local population, with its twisted logic that somehow makes perfect sense, is represented through the tour-de-force acting of supporting players: Bert (Ian McNeice, who always dazzles playing offbeat, world-weary philosophical characters); Louise (the charming and beautiful Caroline Catz), who either loves Martin or wants to kill him; corn-rowed Elaine (lovely Lucy Punch) as the ditzy assistant with her own set of secretarial ethics; and Doc's Aunt Joan (the great Stephanie Cole, who has been delighting audiences since the 1960s).\n\nDominic Minghella, he of the Minghella mob of talented artists (brother Anthony directed 'The English Patient'), is the brains behind this brilliant controlled chaos.\n\nDon't miss this program. TV shows that are both funny AND intelligent are the rarest of TV fare.\n\nAnd a fast footnote: let us all bow our heads and pray that Hollywood doesn't try to remake this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They promptly escaped a maximum security stockade into the Los Angeles Underground.  Today, still wanted by the government, they exist as soldiers of fortune.  If you have a problem, if no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire...\n\nThe A-Team.\n\nWith a script any eight year old would love, the four members of the A-Team went off every week to somewhere in America to help someone who couldn't find help anywhere else.  They battled impossible odds (with impossible storylines) and managed to stay one step ahead of the law.  They were always predictable, heroic, and fun.

That is not to say it is a bad achievement, for the end product is fun, exhilarating and stylish. I do however feel it is extremely important to debunk the 'comic book' label since it is both unjustly applied and it will perhaps generate false expectations from the mainstream audience.\n\nAlthough The Punisher is adapted from Marvel Comics, the R-rating alone should be blunt indicator of the path it intends to take. Half an hour into the film it still leaves us clueless and oblivious to the dark turn it will twist into. During which Thomas Jane undergoes an apt transformation of character from heartfelt family man on that one last undercover op to a hard-boiled, brooding vigilante who downs whiskey, swears, tortures and broods. The catalyst for this development is the brutal murder of his family and now he's out to get the hierarchy of villains (headed by John Travolta)  only he isn't just out for vengeance or justice  he's out to punish. In a corrupt city of thugs, Frank Castle becomes the judge, jury and executor.\n\nWhat is so refreshing about Thomas Jane in the part of Punisher is that he is a sprawling surge of old school with a splash of Clint Eastwood protagonist  the detached, effortless action hero who is too cool for romantic interests, with hardcore one-liners and a merciless approach to duels. In this way, he is easily one of the most successful 'superhero' actors of the new millennium. But alas, Jane went unnoticed and Punisher did poorly at the box office probably BECAUSE it adopted this off-beat, old-school style to acting and action.\n\nI also want to comment on said action, which was spectacular. Truth to be told, I have been waiting a long time to say that about a film. Usually it's the obligatory "the visuals are stunning" or "it's extremely fast-paced and kinetic" but here the sheer hand-to-hand combat is the film's goldmine because it moves back into close character mode instead of the epic scenarios that Batman, Superman and Spiderman dish out to keep out interest. It's gloriously gritty, graphic and dirty which unfortunately also begs the question of where the $33,000,000 budget went. Did they spend it all on late night taco runs?\n\nFor that matter, The Punisher is far from devoid of faults. Its fatal flaw stems, in part, from what made it a good film in the first place: its sparseness of effects, general minimalism and lack of superhero formula. Rather it is a model-kit assembled from seedy old-school revenge action movies, the type you'd sort of casually catch a bit of on TV one night. \n\n7 out of 10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":151841,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Its like Scfi soap opera, you never know who is going to walk through the door. Kudos to Tatiana for her ability to keep in character almost all the time. I actually think she has the record over Eddie Murphy in terms of most diverse characters and yes it does look very down to earth in the characterization i.e soccer moms and students but I think thats makes Orphan Black urban , hip and unique.

Unfortunately in recent years, ER has declined in quality due to the departure of key characters, poor story lines and dull ideas, of which accounted for the decrease in viewing figures. The current crop of characters Neela, Luka, Abby, Pratt, Taggart and Barnett don't hold a candle to the experienced old rear guard of Greene, Carter, Benton, Lewis, Hathaway and Ross. They, in particular, were the original, and arguably the best set of characters the show has had.\n\nThe earlier seasons of ER were great- those times were witty, exciting and a joy to behold for us viewers. Such a shame however that when the old characters had left- or in the case of Mark Greene passed away- the writers of this drama were unable to fill that void with their newer, replacement characters, as well as good story lines and as such, the programme has suffered as a result. \n\nThere were a few story lines I didn't agree with; likewise for example, Mark Greene and Elizabeth Corday getting married together as a couple. I always had an inkling for Mark and Susan, of whom I felt had a lot more in common with each other and considering the history they had together as close friends and work colleagues they had a bond and chemistry that was like a match made in heaven. Also, a lot of ER fans preferred Mark to be with Susan, compared to those who liked Mark and Elizabeth. And so its such a shame that we never got to see Mark and Susan as a couple. There were also tragic and memorable story lines which are worth mentioning also that touched viewers hearts- Mark's brain tumour and his evitable death, Benton's son being mentally handicapped, Weaver coming to terms with her sexuality and coming out as a lesbian to her friends, work colleagues and family, and the consummation of Luka and Abbey and Ross and Carol's relationships. \n\nThe main problem with the ER though were the main characters of the earlier seasons who were on the show for a few series, and then suddenly they are written off. It doesn't matter how many new ideas, characters you introduce to the show because it is the original ideas, characters and realism of the show, of which worked so well in the first place that should be further developed. I wouldn't say that ER has jumped the shark, but it is certainly no longer the same show as it was back in 1994. ER is currently in its 14th season and whilst it is somewhat of an impressive feat, many of the original cast have gone and yet it can be argued that in reference to the current season the show has gradually become boring and stale, the longer it has gone on. \n\nAs the saying goes, all good things must come to an end- and ER perhaps is no exception. Perhaps now it is the time to lay this ghost to rest. As much as it is arguably the best and most successful medical drama in TV history, ER during the last few years has spiralled downhill; the writing isn't as good as it was and it has lost a lot of its spark, which made it the no#1 hit US drama around. Still, as mentioned earlier, it is still the best medical/hospital drama to ever grace our screens. As not even the classic St Elsewhere and Chicago Hope comes close to matching, rivalling or surpassing ER's accomplishments. \n\nBesides, this show will live long in TV history that's for sure and quite rightly so.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53419,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1994-09-19","keywords":"hospital,emergency room,sleeping,medical care,medical doctor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000381/","name":"Anthony Edwards","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000523/","name":"Julianna Margulies"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093758/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037310/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Er: Season 15","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2463087897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Er: Season 15"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you put Bourne Identity, Blacklist and Momento into a blender, you'd end up Blindspot!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68608,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-09-21","keywords":"tattoo,martial arts,tattooed woman,one woman army,fbi agent","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0822982/","name":"Sullivan Stapleton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1526352/","name":"Jaimie Alexander","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4383492/","name":"Audrey Esparza"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0540475/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330789/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005035/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1236625/","name":"Martin Gero"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New York Comic Con Season 3 Sneak Peek","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1315879193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc3YjYwNmQtZjNhYi00Nzk4LWE3OGItMjIzODA1M2U4YmM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjc3YjYwNmQtZjNhYi00Nzk4LWE3OGItMjIzODA1M2U4YmM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","description":"The cast of "Blindspot" had a blast when they returned to New York Comic Con with an appearance this weekend. Fans at the packed Hammerstein Ballroom had the chance to chat with series stars Sullivan Stapleton, Jaimie Alexander, Rob Brown, Audrey Esparza, Ashley Johnson, Luke Mitchell and fan-favorite guest star Ennis Esmer, as well as executive producer Martin Gero, and were treated to an exclusive highlight reel that takes a sneak peek look at Season 3 - with a two-year time jump and a brand-new set of bioluminescent puzzle tattoos! Blindspot premieres Friday, October 27th at 8/7c on NBC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
