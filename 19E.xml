On Wednesday nights, I use to watch "The West Wing", but then that moved to Sunday. I started to watch "Head Cases", but to my great disappointment (though not surprise) that was cancelled.

They have started off a great idea. I hope that it will get better as they go. As for now, the story line is acceptable but everyone except Michael Weatherly seems to be a bit lost. If they could change at least a couple of the supporting actors to somebody who can pull the character off that would make a huge difference. For now, i will keep watching the series. This is also the first time i am writing a review on IMDb. I couldn't stand the show being rated really low and a huge effort has been made and it is interesting and not like what people make it out to be. I urge that people take a view before going through the reviews and not watching it. Maybe you will like it, maybe you wont but you wont know unless you actually watch it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16308,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135585/","name":"Freddy Rodríguez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16201,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135585/","name":"Freddy Rodríguez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the "Most Wanted" episode. That episode was the Pilot for "FBI: Most Wanted" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there. Now give them the surrounding plots and characters that made S1 so good CBS.

They have started off a great idea. I hope that it will get better as they go. As for now, the story line is acceptable but everyone except Michael Weatherly seems to be a bit lost. If they could change at least a couple of the supporting actors to somebody who can pull the character off that would make a huge difference. For now, i will keep watching the series. This is also the first time i am writing a review on IMDb. I couldn't stand the show being rated really low and a huge effort has been made and it is interesting and not like what people make it out to be. I urge that people take a view before going through the reviews and not watching it. Maybe you will like it, maybe you wont but you wont know unless you actually watch it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16308,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135585/","name":"Freddy Rodríguez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This TV show Bull is good, but like many others along this line, you have to remember it is just getting started. Just like any new product that has problems and kinks, they have to be fixed and then rolled out again. Also, trying to care and mend people is a very well difficult and tasking thing to do, but he does it with a bit of style, grace   and oh, getting up in people's faces that deter him with a calm demeanor. Thus, with his experience, this is something he does to get a better scope or compass about them, trying to capture their character so he will know where to go next. I also like his crew, each one does a good job with all they need to do, and with a bit of spirited confidence and can-do attitude alongside of a small amount of humor and comedy. \n\nThe premise of this show is interesting, trying to get into the minds of people to see how they think and what moves them. This character Dr. Bull (Michael Weatherly) seems to care about these people, the defendant, the jury and everyone in between. He even takes the diamond in the rough, the little guy and even the underdog, and makes them become a little better than they were. Besides, I love how his character seems to take the problems that come before him with a cool and rational angle, even when he goes up against a bad guy. Together with his crew this drama, Bull, shows signs of definite potential. So give it a chance, even with its minor snags, you might just learn something about yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16201,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-09-20","keywords":"courtroom,trial,voir dire,lawyer,courtroom drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915762/","name":"Michael Weatherly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0135585/","name":"Freddy Rodríguez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417931/","name":"Geneva Carr"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0607737/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169499/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001921/","name":"Paul Attanasio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1114695/","name":"Phil McGraw"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bull--Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi522762009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1NDkxNDY4Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDIwNjg0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there.

On Wednesday nights, I use to watch "The West Wing", but then that moved to Sunday. I started to watch "Head Cases", but to my great disappointment (though not surprise) that was cancelled.

The director seems to have attempted to give a couple of them more screen time with prolonged noble demises, but the shots seem more distracting than empowering.

White delivers his dialogue with a heavy accent and another character is given an urban 'tude, but as in many films with large casts, the diversity seems more a result of casting decisions than screen writing choices.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3088,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-08-01","keywords":"sequel,2010s,washington state,washington,pacific northwest","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"S.W.A.T.: Under Siege","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3058612249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNmNjNhODYtOGUzMC00MDY5LTk2ZWUtOGIyMTI2MWNhYmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTNmNjNhODYtOGUzMC00MDY5LTk2ZWUtOGIyMTI2MWNhYmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415382/","name":"Sam Jaeger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1597316/","name":"Adrianne Palicki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0925220/","name":"Michael Jai White"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0317638/","name":"Tony Giglio"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017834/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1396586/","name":"Jonas Barnes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2600276/","name":"Keith Domingue"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

How is it possible that a woman like Agnes could agree to kill another human being? Is it the money? Or are there other forces at play? A funeral. A young widow and two adult children. Agnes is burying her much older husband and the children are his, not hers. Agnes senses that someone is watching her and glimpses a woman roughly her own age standing nearby.

She's prepared to pay good money and also to let Agnes choose the manner in which Peter is to die. Agnes realizes that the past has caught up with her and that she has no choice.

Tom Cruise, well-known for his tight control over the Mission Impossible franchise, micromanaged the 2017 remake of "The Mummy" to death. "Light of my Life" does not pretend to be a big-budget blockbuster, but its quality is undermined for a similar reason.\n\nCasey Affleck is the director, writer, and lead actor in this film. When he wrote the many monologues for the father to sermonize, no one took him aside and advised him to cut their number and length. When he delivered the monologues, no one told him that he needed to make his stuttering monotone more lilting and engaging. And clearly no one informed Casey as director that beginning the movie with a 12-minute (truth!) recitation of a Noah's Ark derivative story would kill audience interest at the outset.\n\nAnd that is the frustration I had throughout this movie. There were enough variations on the road trip theme that this could have been an enthralling movie. The father and daughter aren't merely trying to survive a post-apocalyptic environment. He needs to protect her from the real-life horrors that young women risk today, but on an astronomically larger scale.\n\nThe movie shines when it illustrates these risks and progresses the plot by driving them in their quest for the ultimate safe house. When the pair was forced to gauge the trustworthiness of new companions or they were fleeing from undesired ones, I was engaged and cheering them on. But active moments make up far too little of the film; if you watch the trailer, you've seen clips from most of them. Independent advisors would undoubtedly have counseled Affleck accordingly.\n\nThe movie also brushes past the details of both the epidemic and life after the epidemic. When the couple visited a government dispensary or the father mentioned how critical it was to have proper ID, I wanted to learn more about the world had morphed in response to the loss of half of its population. But no, the film doggedly returned to more rambling from the father as the two cower in a foxhole.\n\nI watched the whole movie because I was interested enough in the ending, but I strung it out over 3 days to minimize the tedium. If you decide to see it, fast forward through the first 12 minutes. You'll thank me, I promise.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12299,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-09","keywords":"girl dressed as boy,short haired girl,child with gun,girl dressed as a boy,rifle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi560380953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjZmU4ZWYtYTAwNS00MWNhLWE4MzMtM2JmYjQwYWNhYmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjZmU4ZWYtYTAwNS00MWNhLWE4MzMtM2JmYjQwYWNhYmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Parent and child journey through the outskirts of society a decade after a pandemic has wiped out half the world's population.

Tom Cruise, well-known for his tight control over the Mission Impossible franchise, micromanaged the 2017 remake of "The Mummy" to death. "Light of my Life" does not pretend to be a big-budget blockbuster, but its quality is undermined for a similar reason.\n\nCasey Affleck is the director, writer, and lead actor in this film. When he wrote the many monologues for the father to sermonize, no one took him aside and advised him to cut their number and length. When he delivered the monologues, no one told him that he needed to make his stuttering monotone more lilting and engaging. And clearly no one informed Casey as director that beginning the movie with a 12-minute (truth!) recitation of a Noah's Ark derivative story would kill audience interest at the outset.\n\nAnd that is the frustration I had throughout this movie. There were enough variations on the road trip theme that this could have been an enthralling movie. The father and daughter aren't merely trying to survive a post-apocalyptic environment. He needs to protect her from the real-life horrors that young women risk today, but on an astronomically larger scale.\n\nThe movie shines when it illustrates these risks and progresses the plot by driving them in their quest for the ultimate safe house. When the pair was forced to gauge the trustworthiness of new companions or they were fleeing from undesired ones, I was engaged and cheering them on. But active moments make up far too little of the film; if you watch the trailer, you've seen clips from most of them. Independent advisors would undoubtedly have counseled Affleck accordingly.\n\nThe movie also brushes past the details of both the epidemic and life after the epidemic. When the couple visited a government dispensary or the father mentioned how critical it was to have proper ID, I wanted to learn more about the world had morphed in response to the loss of half of its population. But no, the film doggedly returned to more rambling from the father as the two cower in a foxhole.\n\nI watched the whole movie because I was interested enough in the ending, but I strung it out over 3 days to minimize the tedium. If you decide to see it, fast forward through the first 12 minutes. You'll thank me, I promise.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12299,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-08-09","keywords":"girl dressed as boy,short haired girl,child with gun,girl dressed as a boy,rifle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi560380953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjZmU4ZWYtYTAwNS00MWNhLWE4MzMtM2JmYjQwYWNhYmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBjZmU4ZWYtYTAwNS00MWNhLWE4MzMtM2JmYjQwYWNhYmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Parent and child journey through the outskirts of society a decade after a pandemic has wiped out half the world's population.

 --- Description: Un aller simple: Directed by Laurent Heynemann. With Jacques Villeret, Barbara Schulz, Lorànt Deutsch, Jean Benguigui. I am a civil servant at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. My boss, Loupiac, is having an affair with my wife. I can't take it any longer. I accepted this mission to escape the situation. 'Humanitarian Attaché': I have to take a young clandestine back to his country. He belongs to the tribe of the Grey Men of Irguiz, secluded since prehistoric times in a secret city of the Great Atlas. The kid is amazing. I suspect that his identity papers are fake, that he probably made up this legend. But to believe him is the best way to return him to his home, and it makes me feel good. The power of a legend is unbelievable, once you've decided to believe in it... Being with the kid makes me rediscover life, revive my dreams. And Valérie, the guide he talked me into employing, is about to become the biggest love of my life.

    <title lang="fr">Un aller simple</title>
    <desc lang="fr">Un aller simple: Directed by Laurent Heynemann. With Jacques Villeret, Barbara Schulz, Lorànt Deutsch, Jean Benguigui. I am a civil servant at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. My boss, Loupiac, is having an affair with my wife. I can't take it any longer. I accepted this mission to escape the situation. 'Humanitarian Attaché': I have to take a young clandestine back to his country. He belongs to the tribe of the Grey Men of Irguiz, secluded since prehistoric times in a secret city of the Great Atlas. The kid is amazing. I suspect that his identity papers are fake, that he probably made up this legend. But to believe him is the best way to return him to his home, and it makes me feel good.

 --- Description: Un aller simple: Directed by Laurent Heynemann. With Jacques Villeret, Barbara Schulz, Lorànt Deutsch, Jean Benguigui. I am a civil servant at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. My boss, Loupiac, is having an affair with my wife. I can't take it any longer. I accepted this mission to escape the situation. 'Humanitarian Attaché': I have to take a young clandestine back to his country. He belongs to the tribe of the Grey Men of Irguiz, secluded since prehistoric times in a secret city of the Great Atlas. The kid is amazing. I suspect that his identity papers are fake, that he probably made up this legend. But to believe him is the best way to return him to his home, and it makes me feel good. The power of a legend is unbelievable, once you've decided to believe in it... Being with the kid makes me rediscover life, revive my dreams.

The gritty feel to London is captured viscerally and it's nice seeing different characters which are not usually represented on screen.\n\nThe director feels removed in the best way, but the vision always felt tightly held. The performances feel like real people with their improv-type dialogue.\n\nYou can sense the collaboration and the naturalism bleeds through easily, due to the workshops the actors had partaken in beforehand, making for the hang out moment's and atmosphere feel effortlessly lived in.\n\nThe performances were great due to an impressive ensemble and there was an authenticity not just from the main youthful cast, but all the outsiders 'Rocks' encounters in her story.\n\nBukky Bakray's central performance as 'Rocks' is simply extremely powerful.

He is no longer effective as a teacher and his family life is lacking due to the alienation of his wife and kids. However, on a boozy night out with a group of co-workers / friends an idea is formed, based on Norwegian philosopher and psychologist Finn Skårderud's theory that humans are born with a blood alcohol level 0.050 lower than it should be, and that that amount should be drunk every day in order to bring about optimum performance levels. As all four friends engage in drinking in the morning things appear to work well, until the inevitable escalation. First off, this film is genuinely funny. Secondly, it is moving. Third, it is beautiful to look at. However if I were to judge this film as person who has a troubling relationship with alcohol and try to pinpoint a message to the film, then I would have some trouble. I believe the film is a commentary on the absurdity of Danish drinking culture. Not being Danish I maybe can't fully comprehend the social intricacies, but being British I can certainly understand (drinking is our culture). For better or worse this film doesn't appear to state definitively whether drinking alcohol is good or bad. Certainly you view tragedy born from over imbibing, but then it shows that there are some positives.

The one thing that confuses me, and surely others, is why it's called different names depending on region. To me as a Swede it is called, The Defeated, to others it's called Shadowplay. It causes unnecessary confusion for viewers, but those that do watch it all the way through tend to give it positive ratings.\n\nGive it a chance.

Avec son frère (qui est lui toujours au chaud dans sa coquille), elle part en quête de parents prêts à les adopter. En complément de programme, "Le Nid". Dans la nuit, un drôle d'oiseau solitaire, un oiseau de paradis, est à la recherche d'une âme soeur. Pour attirer l'attention d'un nouveau partenaire, il effectue une parade nuptiale - "L'Oiseau et la Baleine". Repoussé par les siens car il ne sait pas chanter, un baleineau erre dans l'océan et brave de nombreux dangers. Lorsqu'il remonte à la surface, il rencontre un oiseau en cage, seul rescapé d'un naufrage. L'oiseau lui, chante merveilleusement bien...</desc>

    <desc lang="fr">En 2020, la pandémie du Covid 19 a profondément bouleversé l'industrie du cinéma à Hollywood comme ailleurs. En raison des confinements et de la fermeture des cinémas, les longs-métrages n'ont pas pu sortir en salles. Après plusieurs semaines, certains studios ont décidé de sortir les films directement en VOD sur les différentes plateformes. Universal ouvre le bal avec "Trolls 2". Aux Etats-Unis comme ailleurs, les professionnels tentent de sortir de cette crise majeure. Ce documentaire revient sur cette année particulière où le septième art s'est arrêté à Hollywood.</desc>

Even with Lestrade's clearly biased presentation, I came to the same conclusion the jury did - testament to the strength of the autopsy evidence. Res ipsa loquitur - she simply could not have died from a fall down the stairs given the lacerations and the blood. And nothing to suggest that an intruder caused her death. Sure, I winced when Freda Black went on and on about the porn, as if its existence on Peterson's computer in and of itself indicates anything. But all in all it was an interesting lesson into how the skilled storyteller can skew anything towards his chosen bias. And the score was absolutely exquisite.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20538,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary","Crime","Drama"],"keywords":"columnist,blowpoke,true crime,blood,staircase","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2023399/","name":"Michael Peterson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5308683/","name":"David Rudolf","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5509614/","name":"Ron Guerette"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Staircase - Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2745482009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJlZTMyYTktYjA0Mi00ODRiLThkMzQtMmNkM2JmNjI0OTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWJlZTMyYTktYjA0Mi00ODRiLThkMzQtMmNkM2JmNjI0OTI1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"The compelling story of Michael Peterson, a crime novelist accused of killing wife Kathleen after she is found dead at the bottom of a staircase in their home."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I will be completely honest, the first 2 episodes really turned me off. I figured this season was heading down the same path as Roanoke and perhaps worse with the political and social overtones. HOWEVER, I decided to keep watching. Things have turned around dramatically and I am now engaged in this season. It is ridiculous and unbelievable, but the characters are now starting to show themselves and several secrets are now out in the open. The show has been very good the past 3 episodes and has officially drawn me back in.\n\nI will say this... the 5th episode "Holes" is brutal. I've been watching horror for over 30 years and I can honestly say I haven't had a scene un-nerve me to the extent this one did.

I suppose anyone brought up on fin de siecle Hollywood would interpret that as `slow and boring'. But this was Hollywood tackling an intellectual piece with, well, intellect. I must confess that the thought of a 1945 Hollywood attempt at Oscar Wilde did not appeal. Memories of one or two previous efforts at English literary classics set alarm bells ringing. But this was in a class of its own. Beautifully photographed in black and white, apart from a couple shots of the painting itself, the aesthetics shimmer.\n\nI wasn't that convinced about some of the London scenes, especially the low-life portrayal of the East End. The opium den and the `Two Turtles', where Gray first meets Sibyl Vane, look rather too genteel. Compare this view of such places with those created by David Lean, just a couple of years later, in `Oliver Twist'. And this, in a sense, detracts from the depths to which Gray descends in order to be forever youthful and live life with scant regard for others. And in many years of watching BBC Victorian costume dramas I don't recall seeing such outfits on the backs of London's society ladies! However some of the other detail is first class. In particular Sir Thomas's decision to remain at table (`never could resist Aunt Agatha's quails') in spite of Lord Henry's outrageous comments rings true through to today.

I suppose anyone brought up on fin de siecle Hollywood would interpret that as `slow and boring'. But this was Hollywood tackling an intellectual piece with, well, intellect. I must confess that the thought of a 1945 Hollywood attempt at Oscar Wilde did not appeal. Memories of one or two previous efforts at English literary classics set alarm bells ringing. But this was in a class of its own. Beautifully photographed in black and white, apart from a couple shots of the painting itself, the aesthetics shimmer.\n\nI wasn't that convinced about some of the London scenes, especially the low-life portrayal of the East End. The opium den and the `Two Turtles', where Gray first meets Sibyl Vane, look rather too genteel. Compare this view of such places with those created by David Lean, just a couple of years later, in `Oliver Twist'. And this, in a sense, detracts from the depths to which Gray descends in order to be forever youthful and live life with scant regard for others. And in many years of watching BBC Victorian costume dramas I don't recall seeing such outfits on the backs of London's society ladies! However some of the other detail is first class. In particular Sir Thomas's decision to remain at table (`never could resist Aunt Agatha's quails') in spite of Lord Henry's outrageous comments rings true through to today. As the script had it `think like a Liberal, eat like a Tory'.\n\n The acting is excellent with Hurd Hatfield's portrayal quite remarkable in that he wears the same expression virtually throughout, in order, no doubt, to conceal his true emotions. George Sanders, as Lord Henry, steals every scene he's in thanks to a rapid delivery of Wilde's witticisms that would have Groucho Marx and Woody Allen in awe.

Otherwise, watch and enjoy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5107,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Film-Noir"],"datePublished":"1953-03-28","keywords":"title based on song,color in title,murder,telephone,telephone operator","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000879/","name":"Anne Baxter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002017/","name":"Richard Conte","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815433/","name":"Ann Sothern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000485/","name":"Fritz Lang"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0233672/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0388841/","name":"Charles Hoffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0143837/","name":"Vera Caspary"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The theme tune by Tex Ritter is also worthy of note.\n\nHigh Noon' works because of its tightly written script, its cracking pace and crackling tension.

The theme tune by Tex Ritter is also worthy of note.\n\nHigh Noon' works because of its tightly written script, its cracking pace and crackling tension.

    <desc lang="fr">Différente des divas qui l'ont précédée, l'Italienne Anna Magnani, actrice sensuelle au regard magnétique, a offert un nouveau visage au cinéma : celui d'une femme libre, impressionnante de gravité et d'aplomb. Ce documentaire retrace la vie et la carrière riche en coups d'éclats et en traversées du désert d'une actrice douée, excessive et volcanique, à travers les souvenirs de son fils Luca et des cinéastes qui l'ont dirigée. Visconti, Fellini et Renoir racontent, notamment, le bouillonnant talent créatif dont elle nourrissait ses interprétations.</desc>

Fans of Spaghetti Westerns will likely enjoy it more. The film, which primarily involves the transportation of hookers across Argentinian terrain beset by Indians and rebellious deserters, has a lot going for it and a lot against it. Taylor, in one of his last roles, plays an Army Captain whose chief duty is to defend a fort and keep his men from running off and joining the opposing forces led by renegade Randell. Taylor, an actor who methodically and deliberately did everything he could to ruin his pretty-boy looks, appears wax-like and worn in most of his scenes. His growly voice comes across pretty effectively, but he is almost unbearably stoic through most of the film. However, he is put through some grueling physical torment (when his stunt double isn't doing it) that's somewhat remarkable for someone his age. He also gets off a few decent sarcastic lines, but is hard-pressed to overcome his Abraham Sofaer look and costuming. (At times his hat cord blends in with his goatee making him look like he has a long braided beard! He also has a series of unflattering head scarves which are probably authentic, but don't lend themselves to cinematic authority. Most of the cast wear diaper-like rugs between their legs....another authentic aspect which cuts down on the expectations one may have for a western style film. Some will see this as appealingly different, others may scoff at it.) Randell gets to ham it up a bit in the style that was made famous by Eli Wallach and other stronger actors (with better written parts.) Hardin (bizarrely dressed like a sexy Abe Lincoln) comes along late in the game as an anarchist who is being remanded to Army duty. He has a couple of interesting moments (and a great final scene!), but is mostly wasted. WHY wasn't he in the river with the hookers when they were bathing?? The hookers are a motley group of international actresses. It's hard to drum up much interest in most of them as their characters are only scratched upon. One thing setting apart the interest level in anyone who isn't a name brand star is the atrocious dubbing of the film. This is why those accustomed to Spaghetti Westerns may give the movie higher marks than other viewers. One male actor has a creepy, whispering sound to all of his lines. The ladies mostly have shrill, loud or gravelly voices assigned to them. Any sort of bit part sounds like it was recorded off the street. What's good about the film is it's unusual setting and it's desert scenery. Also, there are certain story elements which come across as unique or at least not overdone. (The Indians use these nasty little ball &amp; rope weapons which are intriguing to see.) A couple of confrontations and action scenes are memorable, even if on an amusing level. (Look out for that head!) What's bad about the film is the aforementioned dubbing, the disjointed nature of the script which makes it hard at first to understand the story, and the choppy editing, unfocused direction and amateurish acting by some of the supporting players. Western diehards should find something to like, but most mainstream filmgoers will find it rough to get through."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"1965-07-07","keywords":"argentina,spaghetti western,remake by original director,indian,soldier","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001791/","name":"Robert Taylor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0523601/","name":"Mario Lozano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0733537/","name":"Felicia Roc"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293707/","name":"Hugo Fregonese"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021510/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029433/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019677/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293707/","name":"Hugo Fregonese"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578367/","name":"John Melson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0677538/","name":"Ulises Petit de Murat"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, he is put through some grueling physical torment (when his stunt double isn't doing it) that's somewhat remarkable for someone his age. He also gets off a few decent sarcastic lines, but is hard-pressed to overcome his Abraham Sofaer look and costuming. (At times his hat cord blends in with his goatee making him look like he has a long braided beard! He also has a series of unflattering head scarves which are probably authentic, but don't lend themselves to cinematic authority. Most of the cast wear diaper-like rugs between their legs....another authentic aspect which cuts down on the expectations one may have for a western style film. Some will see this as appealingly different, others may scoff at it.) Randell gets to ham it up a bit in the style that was made famous by Eli Wallach and other stronger actors (with better written parts.) Hardin (bizarrely dressed like a sexy Abe Lincoln) comes along late in the game as an anarchist who is being remanded to Army duty. He has a couple of interesting moments (and a great final scene!), but is mostly wasted. WHY wasn't he in the river with the hookers when they were bathing?? The hookers are a motley group of international actresses. It's hard to drum up much interest in most of them as their characters are only scratched upon. One thing setting apart the interest level in anyone who isn't a name brand star is the atrocious dubbing of the film. This is why those accustomed to Spaghetti Westerns may give the movie higher marks than other viewers. One male actor has a creepy, whispering sound to all of his lines. The ladies mostly have shrill, loud or gravelly voices assigned to them. Any sort of bit part sounds like it was recorded off the street. What's good about the film is it's unusual setting and it's desert scenery. Also, there are certain story elements which come across as unique or at least not overdone. (The Indians use these nasty little ball &amp; rope weapons which are intriguing to see.) A couple of confrontations and action scenes are memorable, even if on an amusing level. (Look out for that head!) What's bad about the film is the aforementioned dubbing, the disjointed nature of the script which makes it hard at first to understand the story, and the choppy editing, unfocused direction and amateurish acting by some of the supporting players. Western diehards should find something to like, but most mainstream filmgoers will find it rough to get through.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"1965-07-07","keywords":"argentina,spaghetti western,remake by original director,indian,soldier","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001791/","name":"Robert Taylor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0523601/","name":"Mario Lozano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0733537/","name":"Felicia Roc"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293707/","name":"Hugo Fregonese"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021510/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029433/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019677/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293707/","name":"Hugo Fregonese","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578367/","name":"John Melson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0677538/","name":"Ulises Petit de Murat"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's a great part for Douglas with his incredible charm and quick burn when someone does him wrong.\n\nThe Big Sky was RKO Pictures big production for 1952. I'd like to say that Howard Hughes spared no expense in making this film, shooting a good deal of it in the Grand Tetons, the actual location for the adventures of many fur trappers. But for the life of me I don't understand why Hughes and RKO after doing that, didn't spring for color.\n\nPossibly because director Howard Hawks wanted black and white. His last epic film Red River had done well in black and white. Still I really think something was missed. RKO did use color on films with a lot less budget.\n\nThere's a lot of similarity between The Big Sky and Red River. Both films involve a group of men on an epic journey into the unknown for business reasons. In Red River, John Wayne has to get that huge herd to market and has to use a trail few have used. In The Big Sky a group of independent trappers basically want to land a nice fur contract with the Blackfeet Indians where few whites have gone up the Missouri River. Going against them is a fur trading consortium kind of like the one John Jacob Astor put together.\n\nThe trappers are mostly French Canadian Metis headed by Steven Geray, but also along is Arthur Hunnicutt who speaks the Indian language. Their ace in the hole is Elizabeth Threatt, a Blackfoot princess the trappers have rescued and are bringing back to her people in the hopes that her old man will be grateful. Hunnicutt is also the narrator of the film.\n\nDouglas and Dewey Martin join up with the group in St. Louis and the trappers have the usual adventures as they take the flatboat up into the Missouri River country. The scenes showing journey upriver are nicely photographed.\n\nTwo others in the cast merit attention. Hank Worden does a nice job as a lost Blackfoot Indian who the trappers pick up. He may not be playing with a full deck, but he does come in handy. Jim Davis is one lean and mean villain as the company troubleshooter who wants to keep the independents out.\n\nArthur Hunnicutt got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role, The Big Sky proved to be his career film. Unfortunately he lost to Anthony Quinn for Viva Zapata. Still Hunnicutt's folksy charm was always something to look forward to in any film he was ever in.\n\nThe Big Sky is one of the best films ever done about the mountain man era of the American frontier. If they'd only spent for color.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4110,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"1952-10-24","keywords":"grand teton national park,yellowstone national park,native americans,voice over narration,narrated by character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4189896729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFiM2UwYzYtMTA2OS00Zjc3LWI3NDUtZWE2ODdhN2Q5NWYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFiM2UwYzYtMTA2OS00Zjc3LWI3NDUtZWE2ODdhN2Q5NWYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The success of the journey focuses on keeping the Indian girl alive as well as themselves to complete trade with the Blackfeet."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000018/","name":"Kirk Douglas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0552185/","name":"Dewey Martin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0861910/","name":"Elizabeth Threatt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001328/","name":"Howard Hawks"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078135/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0629580/","name":"Dudley Nichols"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0349238/","name":"A.B.

It's a great part for Douglas with his incredible charm and quick burn when someone does him wrong.\n\nThe Big Sky was RKO Pictures big production for 1952. I'd like to say that Howard Hughes spared no expense in making this film, shooting a good deal of it in the Grand Tetons, the actual location for the adventures of many fur trappers. But for the life of me I don't understand why Hughes and RKO after doing that, didn't spring for color.\n\nPossibly because director Howard Hawks wanted black and white. His last epic film Red River had done well in black and white. Still I really think something was missed. RKO did use color on films with a lot less budget.\n\nThere's a lot of similarity between The Big Sky and Red River. Both films involve a group of men on an epic journey into the unknown for business reasons. In Red River, John Wayne has to get that huge herd to market and has to use a trail few have used. In The Big Sky a group of independent trappers basically want to land a nice fur contract with the Blackfeet Indians where few whites have gone up the Missouri River. Going against them is a fur trading consortium kind of like the one John Jacob Astor put together.\n\nThe trappers are mostly French Canadian Metis headed by Steven Geray, but also along is Arthur Hunnicutt who speaks the Indian language. Their ace in the hole is Elizabeth Threatt, a Blackfoot princess the trappers have rescued and are bringing back to her people in the hopes that her old man will be grateful. Hunnicutt is also the narrator of the film.\n\nDouglas and Dewey Martin join up with the group in St. Louis and the trappers have the usual adventures as they take the flatboat up into the Missouri River country. The scenes showing journey upriver are nicely photographed.\n\nTwo others in the cast merit attention. Hank Worden does a nice job as a lost Blackfoot Indian who the trappers pick up. He may not be playing with a full deck, but he does come in handy. Jim Davis is one lean and mean villain as the company troubleshooter who wants to keep the independents out.\n\nArthur Hunnicutt got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role, The Big Sky proved to be his career film. Unfortunately he lost to Anthony Quinn for Viva Zapata. Still Hunnicutt's folksy charm was always something to look forward to in any film he was ever in.\n\nThe Big Sky is one of the best films ever done about the mountain man era of the American frontier. If they'd only spent for color.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4110,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"Approved","genre":["Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"1952-10-24","keywords":"grand teton national park,yellowstone national park,native americans,voice over narration,narrated by character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4189896729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFiM2UwYzYtMTA2OS00Zjc3LWI3NDUtZWE2ODdhN2Q5NWYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTFiM2UwYzYtMTA2OS00Zjc3LWI3NDUtZWE2ODdhN2Q5NWYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The success of the journey focuses on keeping the Indian girl alive as well as themselves to complete trade with the Blackfeet.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000018/","name":"Kirk Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0552185/","name":"Dewey Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0861910/","name":"Elizabeth Threatt"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001328/","name":"Howard Hawks"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078135/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0629580/","name":"Dudley Nichols","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0349238/","name":"A.B.

Mussolini banned it in Italy, and Hitler's Ministry of Propaganda banned it in Nazi Germany. The film vanished during WWII, and was thought to have been destroyed. Then it was recovered in 1946, but in an altered state. Decades would then pass before the original negative could be confirmed.\n\nThe Nazis hated the film because of its pacifist, anti-war, theme. The setting for the film is Germany in 1914, during WWI. Germans capture several French officers and take them to a POW camp, specifically for officers. After several escape attempts, the French officers get shuffled off to a presumably escape proof castle, run by Rauffenstein (Erich von Stroheim), a flamboyant German officer with a forbidding persona.\n\nUnlike other war movies, "La Grande Illusion" shows no actual combat, and the number of deaths is minimal. The film's tone is surprisingly lighthearted. Writer/Director Renoir conveys a sense of community among the French prisoners, despite their differences in social class. We see them several times sitting around a table eating, and chatting amiably. The cordiality between prisoners and their jailers is also surprising. It's not exactly a hug fest, but the predominant feeling among the men is respect for fellow officers, even if those officers are your enemy. None of the French or German officers want war; it's just their "duty", when called on.\n\nIn most of the film, scenes take place in small rooms or in that castle. Toward the film's end, outdoor vistas provide a visual contrast. Except at the film's end, I was amazed at how drab the surroundings are. Room furnishings are unadorned and contain the barest of essentials. Tables and floors are made of simple wood. The clothes are dreary and depressing. The stone castle is dank and forbidding. Music is made with simple instruments, like a harmonica or a flute. Of course, given the time period and considering the setting, such drabness and simplicity are not surprising. But the contrast with today's complex world of modern luxuries, that we take for granted, is striking. The film's B&amp;W cinematography accentuates the drab environment.\n\nThe story can be a bit confusing in the first half, because the relationship between the jailers and the prisoners is so unusual. Viewers need to give the film wide latitude on this. Watching the film a second time helps clarify who is doing what to whom. The plot is easier to follow in the second half.\n\nThe film's acting is credible. I especially liked the performance of von Stroheim, all decked out in that imposing uniform, that monocle, and with that stiff bearing.\n\n"La Grande Illusion" is an unusual "war" film, one that had real significance during WWII. For this reason alone, it deserves to be seen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35270,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1937-10-04","keywords":"military,french soldier,upper class,prisoner of war camp,christmas","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grand Illusion: 75th Anniversary","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1344124953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQxZTlhOGQtMmNlYy00Y2IyLWI3YmUtMjZjMTQ3MDJhNWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmQxZTlhOGQtMmNlYy00Y2IyLWI3YmUtMjZjMTQ3MDJhNWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Grand Illusion"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0300064/","name":"Jean Gabin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0663077/","name":"Dita Parlo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0294382/","name":"Pierre Fresnay"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0719756/","name":"Jean Renoir"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053790/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0816458/","name":"Charles Spaak"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0719756/","name":"Jean Renoir"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

First of all, William Holden's performance in this film gives this film a very big lead against many other films like it.  Holden is a very good actor given a very good role here as Sefton, a soldier that uniquely accepts his situation.  The other supporting, and even prominent roles are good but seems "intentionally" underdeveloped for the benefit of not complicating viewers with unnecessary information.  The story, consisting of a "whodunit" plot, wartime ordeals, and amusing dialogue between the characters is superb for it's time.  All in all, watching "Stalag 17" is at least a fine way to spend your time.  \n\nI've read many reviews that say that they were disappointed with this film. Some were annoyed because it wasn't as realistically gritty and tense like "Saving Private Ryan".  Well, that's the effect of the Hays Offices (censorship officials of American produced movies during the past).  I have to say that although it may have lacked the grittiness of Spielberg's film, it still surpasses "Saving Private Ryan" for it's honest approach to it's characters such as the POW that responds to his wife's letter ("I believe it.") with a certain kind of feeling that can truly be described as honest and the German "Wake up caller" Scherbach's constant joking around with POWs while remaining true to his kommandant's wishes.  The 'Animal' and Shapiro characters were obviously created for comic relief but it should only be taken as that, comic relief (Hell, everyone's a comedian and at least they tried).  Most anybody that was disappointed with this film were probably disappointed for it's strange association with the TV show "Hogan's Heroes". I must say that I don't care much for that certain show but I do like this film.  \n\nI really don't think that any film should ever be compared with another film or a TV show (unless it's a spinoff, then they're just asking for it) no matter how related they are.  A movie is a movie on it's own and never with the help of another, no matter the similarities.  This is a classic film, worthy of it's praise yet unworthy of it's negative critique.  Nobody should let personal opinions be considered flaws.

Coming along at a crossroads section in French fornication film history, with simulation rapidly rendered obsolete by full color penetration, Unia felt commercially compelled to retrieve his labor of love from domestic distribution at the eleventh hour, sprucing up its mildly naughty shenanigans with pornographic pickup shots, a common practice at this stage in the evolution of European erotic cinema.

Even though there's a price to pay for their defiance, a recurring turn of events throughout Unia's explicit endeavors, his female characters have the last word, obtaining vengeance both sophisticated and unexpected for the unbridled male violence inflicted upon them, a knee-jerk reaction towards their mates' challenging an increasingly antiquated status quo.\n\nAttempting to emulate EMMANUELLE's continued box office drawing power, with video rental and cable TV a reliable secondary source of income, Unia scheduled a brief return to real name respectability with a score of four tame trifles, all of which amazingly opened alongside Hollywood blockbusters at Paris first run theaters.

Last as well as least of the lot, OUTRAGE AUX MOEURS approximates a cheapskate rendition of the already sordid if marginally popular (due in no small part to their pulp print source) BRIGADE MONDAINE skin-heavy "thrillers" searching to expose such tabloid-friendly subjects as white slavery and drug trafficking.\n\nThirtysomething movie mogul Claude Farrell ("Chris Garini" a/k/a porn performer Ghislain Garet, prominently featured in Gérard Kikoïne's NEVER ENOUGH) has the hots for aspiring actress Grendy Daumier (Valérie Houlier), star of his latest not-quite-porn blockbuster DORTOIR DES GRANDES - in reality, Unia's previous simulated opus COLLEGE DORMITORY - and at least a decade his junior. Unaware she's using him to further her career, with frequent trips to the tropical isle of St. Barts a pleasant bonus (not least in terms of production value), Claude receives the proverbial wake up call coming back from business earlier than expected to find Grendy giving it up to a lowly delivery guy. Shooting his rival for the unworthy tramp's affections, he goes on the lam, seeking refuge on a houseboat inhabited by another pair of cinema hopefuls, down to earth Chantal (Laetitia Thomas) and round-heeled Carla ("Ghislaine Kerdavid" a/k/a Michelle Davy, star of Michel Lemoine's LOVE IN PARADISE) who respond to Claude's disruptive presence in radically different ways.

Both films feature spontaneous musical outbursts from the actresses but unlike 8 Women, which basically is a whodunit, Filles perdues cheveux gras is only an average girl movie promoting friendship in troubled times. Those three twenty something women have a hard time falling in love, keeping a baby or staying sober, but together they will see the light... And light it sure is, but the comedy is kind of lost through a narrative which tends to spend too much time with one particular character (the young mother) thus bringing a certain boredom to the whole film. Only the set decoration and the visuals are sometime effective as they seem to modernize (or just copy) old Jacques Demy movies such as Les parapluies de Cherbourg or Les Demoiselles de Rochefort both much better movies.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":472,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-09-10","keywords":"bestiality,sex,friendship,hair,cat","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0142972/","name":"Amira Casar"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283997/","name":"Marina Foïs"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093740/","name":"Olivia Bonamy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244967/","name":"Claude Duty"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055742/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1027988/","name":"Jean-Philippe Barrau"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244967/","name":"Claude Duty"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1038819/","name":"Pascale Faure"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Both films feature spontaneous musical outbursts from the actresses but unlike 8 Women, which basically is a whodunit, Filles perdues cheveux gras is only an average girl movie promoting friendship in troubled times. Those three twenty something women have a hard time falling in love, keeping a baby or staying sober, but together they will see the light... And light it sure is, but the comedy is kind of lost through a narrative which tends to spend too much time with one particular character (the young mother) thus bringing a certain boredom to the whole film. Only the set decoration and the visuals are sometime effective as they seem to modernize (or just copy) old Jacques Demy movies such as Les parapluies de Cherbourg or Les Demoiselles de Rochefort both much better movies.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":472,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-09-10","keywords":"bestiality,sex,friendship,hair,cat","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0142972/","name":"Amira Casar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283997/","name":"Marina Foïs","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093740/","name":"Olivia Bonamy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244967/","name":"Claude Duty"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055742/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1027988/","name":"Jean-Philippe Barrau","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0244967/","name":"Claude Duty","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1038819/","name":"Pascale Faure"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Fassbinder has an extraordinary light touch, and it is a fascinating ride through the endemic connivance's of the petit-bourgeois wheeler-dealers of a small German city. One can actually hear Fassbinder giggling in the background as he brings the universal character of the average conformist-hustler to the screen.\n\nBarbara Sukowa as Lola, is a magnificent actress, especially where she accepts the humiliations of her life, but will not allow them to transform her into the brutalized animal level of behavior, that she observes all around her. Always optimistic, she pursues her goal {to escape from the prison of degradation, she is in}. We, {the viewers}, follow her journey, as she overcomes obstacle after obstacle, to eventually triumph, and take her place as a citizen of her particular Peyton Place. \n\nHow she does it is colorful and informative.

Fassbinder has an extraordinary light touch, and it is a fascinating ride through the endemic connivance's of the petit-bourgeois wheeler-dealers of a small German city. One can actually hear Fassbinder giggling in the background as he brings the universal character of the average conformist-hustler to the screen.\n\nBarbara Sukowa as Lola, is a magnificent actress, especially where she accepts the humiliations of her life, but will not allow them to transform her into the brutalized animal level of behavior, that she observes all around her. Always optimistic, she pursues her goal to escape from the prison of degradation, she is in. We, the viewers, follow her journey, as she overcomes obstacle after obstacle, to eventually triumph, and take her place as a citizen of her particular Peyton Place. \n\nHow she does it is colorful and informative. Fassbinder gives you all the different strata of class prejudice, as the money men are in cahoots with the bureaucrats, who are all, in turn, driven by libidinal desires. Mixing up cabaret elements, together with the controlling power of money, blended in with, the huge heart of those that earn their crust as sex workers this, is so obviously where Fassbinder's sympathies lie.

Bad Faith tackles the same core issues, and while it does have its funny moments, contains more thoughtful insights to this real world predicament.\n\nIsmael (Roschidy Zem, who also directed this movie) and Clara (Cecile De France) are the perfect cross-cultural couple who has spent the last 4 years in a trouble-free relationship. Being non-practising in their respective religions (he's Muslim while she's Jew), the notion of religion, race and culture doesn't factor into their relationship until the coming of an unexpected baby. The consideration of having to inform their respective parents fed on their fears of having them reject their other half, and it even boils right down to details such as the baby's name, whom Ismael is dead set with naming him after his dad.\n\nThis exploration of unfounded fears provide much verbose insight to some of the nagging thoughts one would probably have when trying to appease the older generation, who in their earnestness would like to see an in-law coming from the same cultural/religious background for ease of assimilating with one another, and the potential avoidance of conflicts. At one point, one of the parents requested their child to consider all the trouble they would expect from frowning neighbours in their community, which stem from the lack of understanding, and fueled by deep prejudice and discrimination.\n\nWhich is a reminder that usually, a union of 2 actually is a union of more, which includes immediate family members, like it or not, who play a huge role in determining if the union thereafter would be stress-free. Clara's parents Victor (Jean-Pierre Cassel) and Lucie (Martine Chevallier) become confused with their daughter's choice for a husband, and the former works at Ismael being converted to Judaism to appease his wife, much to Ismael's amusement. On the other hand, Ismael finds difficulty in breaking the news to his mother, for fear of what he thinks will be a downright disapproval given Clara's background.\n\nThis examination of issues will test the resolve, depth of love and trust that the couple has for each other as it tears through the fabric of their open-mindedness and beliefs, and it's not always just between the two couple though, as Ismael's best friend Milou (Pascal Elbe) who is also a Jew, provide yet another outlet for the venting of frustration and deep rooted fears.\n\nBut don't be mistaken it's not all doom and gloom. Despite some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments, Bad Faith does provide for some critical moments where you're more than likely to be finding yourself rooting for the couple against all adversary that come their way. Both leads are charismatic enough for anyone in the audience to want to wish their characters well (The last time I saw Cecile De France was in the bloody gore movie High Tension, so it's a very different take here to see her in a romantic comedy) and it does play on some of our unfounded fears, so it's really just taking things as they come, while remaining optimistic that they will indeed turn out for the better, especially when you have love conquering all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":625,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-12-06","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0208426/","name":"Cécile de France"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954704/","name":"Roschdy Zem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253018/","name":"Pascal Elbé"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954704/","name":"Roschdy Zem"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060537/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954704/","name":"Roschdy Zem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253018/","name":"Pascal Elbé"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0755389/","name":"Agnès de Sacy"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But the news is not well received by their respect","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0498118/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"DICK STEEL","dateCreated":"2008-10-04","inLanguage":"English","name":"A Nutshell Review: Bad Faith","reviewBody":"For all the seriousness of the topic in examining whether race, culture and religion would come to play in a relationship between two lovers, the last movie I had watched which broached the topic, was the zany Adam Sandler comedy You Don't Mess With The Zohan, where his Israeli superspy falls for a Palestinian hairdresser many miles from home at the Big Apple. Bad Faith tackles the same core issues, and while it does have its funny moments, contains more thoughtful insights to this real world predicament.\n\nIsmael (Roschidy Zem, who also directed this movie) and Clara (Cecile De France) are the perfect cross-cultural couple who has spent the last 4 years in a trouble-free relationship. Being non-practising in their respective religions (he's Muslim while she's Jew), the notion of religion, race and culture doesn't factor into their relationship until the coming of an unexpected baby. The consideration of having to inform their respective parents fed on their fears of having them reject their other half, and it even boils right down to details such as the baby's name, whom Ismael is dead set with naming him after his dad.\n\nThis exploration of unfounded fears provide much verbose insight to some of the nagging thoughts one would probably have when trying to appease the older generation, who in their earnestness would like to see an in-law coming from the same cultural/religious background for ease of assimilating with one another, and the potential avoidance of conflicts. At one point, one of the parents requested their child to consider all the trouble they would expect from frowning neighbours in their community, which stem from the lack of understanding, and fueled by deep prejudice and discrimination.\n\nWhich is a reminder that usually, a union of 2 actually is a union of more, which includes immediate family members, like it or not, who play a huge role in determining if the union thereafter would be stress-free. Clara's parents Victor (Jean-Pierre Cassel) and Lucie (Martine Chevallier) become confused with their daughter's choice for a husband, and the former works at Ismael being converted to Judaism to appease his wife, much to Ismael's amusement. On the other hand, Ismael finds difficulty in breaking the news to his mother, for fear of what he thinks will be a downright disapproval given Clara's background.\n\nThis examination of issues will test the resolve, depth of love and trust that the couple has for each other as it tears through the fabric of their open-mindedness and beliefs, and it's not always just between the two couple though, as Ismael's best friend Milou (Pascal Elbe) who is also a Jew, provide yet another outlet for the venting of frustration and deep rooted fears.\n\nBut don't be mistaken it's not all doom and gloom. Despite some genuinely funny laugh out loud moments, Bad Faith does provide for some critical moments where you're more than likely to be finding yourself rooting for the couple against all adversary that come their way. Both leads are charismatic enough for anyone in the audience to want to wish their characters well (The last time I saw Cecile De France was in the bloody gore movie High Tension, so it's a very different take here to see her in a romantic comedy) and it does play on some of our unfounded fears, so it's really just taking things as they come, while remaining optimistic that they will indeed turn out for the better, especially when you have love conquering all.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":625,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-12-06","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0208426/","name":"Cécile de France","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954704/","name":"Roschdy Zem","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253018/","name":"Pascal Elbé"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954704/","name":"Roschdy Zem"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060537/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954704/","name":"Roschdy Zem","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253018/","name":"Pascal Elbé","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0755389/","name":"Agnès de Sacy"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Most people (outside the United States) wouldn't know the America shown throughout this film - where folks are priced out of their own states, where they attend community colleges that aren't crazy over keg parties and crawling with bikini-straddling blonds, where students have to juggle work and school, where they might have to choose the former over the latter too often.\n\nHollywood glamorizes the American lifestyle each and every chance it gets, and this film provides a rare glimpse into the real America where most people reside.\n\nAll things considered, I would consider this film a feel-good movie, and there's much more to it than meets the eye. If you enjoyed Forest Gump, you'd most likely enjoy this one - even if the feel-goodness sets in slightly more subtly.\n\nOne final thing - I've never written a review for any movie before, ever.

It's been 80 years since THE WIZARD OF OZ was released and 50 years since Judy Garland died. So why do we still care so much? Of course the obvious reason is that, for many generations, her adventures as Dorothy Gale from Kansas marked the first time many of us kids could put ourselves in the shoes (mine weren't ruby sparkles) of a lead character in a movie. Her fantastical journey ignited our imaginations and whisked us away to fight witches and flying monkeys, while making wonderful friends in a corn patch and enchanted forest. Oh, and that voice! However, there is another side to this coin. Judy's story is also an example of the dark and tarnished side of Hollywood ... she pulled back more than one curtain.\n\nRenee Zellweger (Oscar winner for COLD MOUNTAIN, 2003) stars as Judy Garland, and her performance will likely put her in line for her fourth Oscar nomination. The film basically covers the last year of Judy's life, and director Rupert Goold (TRUE STORY, 2015) is working from a script by Tom Edge adapted from Peter Quilter's stage play, "End of the Rainbow". There is no Lollipop Guild here. Instead, the harsh realities of Judy's life are explored. The film opens with Judy and her kids, Joe and Lorna, performing on stage ... and then being unceremoniously denied a room at a nearby luxury hotel. See, Judy's career is in a bad way (admittedly undependable and uninsurable) - as is her health. She is broke, has no home, and offers for roles or performances have dried up. She ends up at her ex-husband Sid Luft's (Rufus Sewell) home, which after some former-spouse bickering, is where the kids stay.\n\nWith no other real prospective gigs, Judy accepts an offer from Bernard Delfont (Michael Gambon) to perform at his Talk of the Town theatre in London. Most of the film covers her time in London, and the challenges for all involved. She's 46 years old in the winter of 1968, and though her voice no longer carries the sublime purity of those early years, Judy still has incredible stage presence and an ability to connect with the audience. The challenges occur for her assigned assistant Rosalyn Wilder (who served as a consultant on the film, and is played here by rising star Jessie Buckley), as well as Judy herself. She misses her kids, and is battling loneliness and an addiction to pills - causing her to rarely eat or sleep. When her "friend" (and fifth husband) Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock) shows up, Judy's attitude perks up, but her already questionable dependability falters.\n\nFlashbacks to Judy's teenage years at MGM are used to portray how the studio and industry took control of her body, soul and career. Watching studio head Louis B Mayer (Richard Cordery) bully young Judy (played by newcomer Darci Shaw) by pretending to be a father figure while keeping her weight in line with a diet of cigarettes, diet pills, and soup, is just painful. These scenes, including those with young Judy's frequent co-star Mickey Rooney, help us understand why she was in such a state by the time she hit London. Ms. Zellweger embodies the blend of frailty and determination and talent, as well as the insecurities that simultaneously drove Judy and held her back. Of course, few singers have ever possessed the vocal talent of Judy, but Zellweger admirably brings the appropriate strain and pain to the songs she sings for the movie, including "By Myself" and "The Trolley Song".\n\nBorn Frances Ethel Gumm, Judy Garland first hit the stage at age 2, and never experienced a "normal" childhood or traditional relationship. Despite her immense talent, she was never able to find peace with the pressures of performing. Years of abuse led to an early death, not long after she finished her London run. The film never backs away from the tragic story, but also allows one of the brightest stars of an era to shine through. For those who only know Judy as that homesick girl from Kansas, or maybe also as the rosy-cheeked youngster on the Trolley in the holiday favorite MEET ME IN ST LOUIS (directed by her future husband Vincente Minnelli), there is likely a shock factor in seeing the broken icon in middle age. The film also deals with that always-present bond she had with her audience, especially with the gay community - although a certain sequence of the film seems quite improbable.\n\nFor a film like this to work (it was not sanctioned by Judy's daughter Liza Minnelli), it all rides on the lead performance. Renee Zellweger beautifully captures both the tragic essence and the stunning talent of the late 1960's Judy Garland, an iconic and revered entertainment figure. The film allows us to understand the lifelong mistreatment and heartbreak of this woman, as well as the strength and joy she received while performing live. Balancing the "early" Judy with the "later" Judy was a brilliant way of bringing her life full circle. Ms. Zellweger's performance goes so much deeper than singing on stage ... she embodies the insecurity and frailties of a woman who was never afforded the opportunity to live her own life.\n\nNOTE: There was a 2001 TV mini-series entitled "Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows", based on daughter Lorna Luft's memoir, in which Judy Davis (lip-synching to Ms. Garland's songs) delivered an impressive and Emmy winning performance.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45465,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"london england,concert,year 1968,ex husband ex wife relationship,sleeplessness","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing !?!?!

She's 46 years old in the winter of 1968, and though her voice no longer carries the sublime purity of those early years, Judy still has incredible stage presence and an ability to connect with the audience. The challenges occur for her assigned assistant Rosalyn Wilder (who served as a consultant on the film, and is played here by rising star Jessie Buckley), as well as Judy herself. She misses her kids, and is battling loneliness and an addiction to pills - causing her to rarely eat or sleep. When her "friend" (and fifth husband) Mickey Deans (Finn Wittrock) shows up, Judy's attitude perks up, but her already questionable dependability falters.\n\nFlashbacks to Judy's teenage years at MGM are used to portray how the studio and industry took control of her body, soul and career. Watching studio head Louis B Mayer (Richard Cordery) bully young Judy (played by newcomer Darci Shaw) by pretending to be a father figure while keeping her weight in line with a diet of cigarettes, diet pills, and soup, is just painful. These scenes, including those with young Judy's frequent co-star Mickey Rooney, help us understand why she was in such a state by the time she hit London. Ms. Zellweger embodies the blend of frailty and determination and talent, as well as the insecurities that simultaneously drove Judy and held her back. Of course, few singers have ever possessed the vocal talent of Judy, but Zellweger admirably brings the appropriate strain and pain to the songs she sings for the movie, including "By Myself" and "The Trolley Song".\n\nBorn Frances Ethel Gumm, Judy Garland first hit the stage at age 2, and never experienced a "normal" childhood or traditional relationship. Despite her immense talent, she was never able to find peace with the pressures of performing. Years of abuse led to an early death, not long after she finished her London run. The film never backs away from the tragic story, but also allows one of the brightest stars of an era to shine through. For those who only know Judy as that homesick girl from Kansas, or maybe also as the rosy-cheeked youngster on the Trolley in the holiday favorite MEET ME IN ST LOUIS (directed by her future husband Vincente Minnelli), there is likely a shock factor in seeing the broken icon in middle age. The film also deals with that always-present bond she had with her audience, especially with the gay community - although a certain sequence of the film seems quite improbable.\n\nFor a film like this to work (it was not sanctioned by Judy's daughter Liza Minnelli), it all rides on the lead performance. Renee Zellweger beautifully captures both the tragic essence and the stunning talent of the late 1960's Judy Garland, an iconic and revered entertainment figure. The film allows us to understand the lifelong mistreatment and heartbreak of this woman, as well as the strength and joy she received while performing live. Balancing the "early" Judy with the "later" Judy was a brilliant way of bringing her life full circle. Ms. Zellweger's performance goes so much deeper than singing on stage ... she embodies the insecurity and frailties of a woman who was never afforded the opportunity to live her own life.\n\nNOTE: There was a 2001 TV mini-series entitled "Life with Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows", based on daughter Lorna Luft's memoir, in which Judy Davis (lip-synching to Ms. Garland's songs) delivered an impressive and Emmy winning performance.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45465,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-10-02","keywords":"london england,concert,year 1968,ex husband ex wife relationship,sleeplessness","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing !?!?!

If you are up for a top-quality movie with a dazzling performance from Matthias Schoenaerts, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11538,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-06-19","keywords":"prison,horse,title directed by female,mustang the horse,wild mustang","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3905731097","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZTBkYmItY2RjOC00NWM2LWE0MDUtY2VkY2QyMjZjNTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWFkZTBkYmItY2RjOC00NWM2LWE0MDUtY2VkY2QyMjZjNTM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A violent convict is given the chance to participate in a rehabilitation therapy program involving the training of wild mustangs.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0774386/","name":"Matthias Schoenaerts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4207146/","name":"Jason Mitchell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001136/","name":"Bruce Dern"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166438/","name":"Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0641111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0807651/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0166438/","name":"Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2178754/","name":"Mona Fastvold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0635431/","name":"Brock Norman Brock"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is director Marjane Satrapi's first film based on a graphic novel that was not written by her. I think that is very obvious and shows her inexperience . The Screenplay by Jack Thorne is just dull and uninteresting I'm sure the book it's based on must be better.\n\nThere are intrusive and unnecessary and distracting references to the future effects of Marie Curie's contributions to Science depicting the future impact of her discoveries, including external beam radiotherapy at a hospital in Cleveland in 1956, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a nuclear bomb test in Nevada in 1961, and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 it gives the impression or perhaps message that perhaps humanity may have been better off without her great discoveries?\n\nBoth the Curies experienced radium burns, both accidentally and voluntarily, and were exposed to extensive doses of radiation while conducting their research.

This is director Marjane Satrapi's first film based on a graphic novel that was not written by her. I think that is very obvious and shows her inexperience . The Screenplay by Jack Thorne is just dull and uninteresting I'm sure the book it's based on must be better.\n\nThere are intrusive and unnecessary and distracting references to the future effects of Marie Curie's contributions to Science depicting the future impact of her discoveries, including external beam radiotherapy at a hospital in Cleveland in 1956, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a nuclear bomb test in Nevada in 1961, and the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 it gives the impression or perhaps message that perhaps humanity may have been better off without her great discoveries?\n\nBoth the Curies experienced radium burns, both accidentally and voluntarily, and were exposed to extensive doses of radiation while conducting their research. They experienced radiation sickness and Marie Curie died of aplastic anemia in 1934. Even now, all their papers from the 1890s, even her cookbooks, are too dangerous to touch. Their laboratory books are kept in special lead boxes and people who want to see them have to wear protective clothing.

At best he's competent at what he does, and some years back made a halfway clever and original 'movie'-comedy (Big Fat Liar), but mostly has kept to Fox studio commercialism like Cheaper by the Dozen and the Night at the Museum movies. And yet, he (or just the studio) must have had the insight to put together two of the funniest people working right now- not to mention with shows back-to-back on Thursday nights on NBC- Steve Carrel and Tina Fey, because they help elevate anyone's work by a longshot. This isn't to say that Josh Klausner's script may not have some laughs, but where exactly I can't be sure, since most of his contributions would appear to come from the super-conventional story aspects (as my own mother put it, "I don't know, looks like The Out of Towners, or that Blind Date movie from the 80's").\n\nSo yeah, basic premise, married couple looking for a little change (their friends are splitting up), go out to 'The City' (NYC of course) and to a very nice restaurant.

The "Tripplehorns", as it turns out, have some shady dealings with some bad dues with guns, and so the Fosters, our confused heroes, go on the run in the city. Whenever the movie focuses on the core plot of all of this, it's by the numbers stuff, save for a climax that ratchets up the absurdity of everyone involved (including good actors playing decent-to-mediocre baddies like William Fichtner and Ray Liotta).\n\nIt's when Fey and Carrel are allowed to play loose with the script that it strikes the iron. Their timing is impeccable, and they have chemistry together, which is crucial. And when they come across some other supporting characters, like Mark Wahlberg's (VERY) shirtless ex-military guy with all of his high-tech equipment, or the "real" Tripplehorns played by James Franco and Mila Kunis, there's further hilarity that ensues from the interactions and precise timing. That's all you need sometimes in a comedy that's based in formula, is two character to at least semi care about (and, perhaps more wisely than a Hollywood rom-com can be given credit for, it has painfully normal characters here, nothing too complicated), and who are funny in semi-funny situations. Even a ridiculous car chase where the Fosters hit a cab and the two are connected bumper to bumper through the streets is funny just because of the acting. Given the right mood and timing they could read a census report and get a few chuckles from the pauses and inflections.\n\nSo, if you're looking for something masterfully done, look elsewhere. If you just want to see two stars who are funny be funny almost despite some of the limitations in the script, Date Night deserves a chance.

For the first time, with "Les émotifs associés" (2010), Améris has opted for a lighter tone, ... without indulging in superficiality for all that. His new effort marks in fact an interesting evolution in Jean-Pierre Améris's way to address his subjects. At ease with the problems of others (his characters), the writer-director has now decided to examine a question that concerns his own self and to do it with optimism.\n\nFor if there is a subject that Jean-Pierre Améris knows like the back of his hand it is hyper emotionality. A highly emotional person himself since he was a child, Améris has however been able to give a film crew orders, to guide them and to impose himself on them, a thing an overly timid creature would never dream of ever managing to do. Having now overcome his handicap (at least to some extent as he occasionally still finds it hard to make a decision or deal with strangers), the director has undertaken to share his experience with his audiences and help the victims of hyper emotionality to have a better life.\n\nAnd what better way to achieve this goal than resorting to the romantic comedy genre? For sure, provided a filmmaker avoids falling into the trap of over-sentimentality, he or she will make an audience susceptible to the attraction of one character to the other and take advantage of this feeling of empathy to instill his message in the complicit viewers. What Jean-Pierre Améris needed first was two amiable spokespersons to pass on his message and, with the help of his co-writer Philippe Blasband, he has given life to an engaging couple, consisting of Jean-René, the owner of a small chocolate factory who has never overcome his mental blocks and has remained single despite his deep love for women, and Angélique, probably the best chocolate maker alive, but who, for exactly the same reasons, has failed to make a name for herself and to find the genial soul. Mission accomplished, as the two characters are well delineated and remarkably interpreted by Benoît Poelvoorde and Isabelle Carré.\n\nThis established, all the suspense will lie in the fact that though Angélique and Jean-René share a common passion for chocolate and are drawn to each other, the fear of giving a bad image of themselves and of taking the first step, is a source of misunderstanding and tends to estrange them. Will there be a happy ending? Nothing is less certain...\n\nThrough this situation and these two characters, Jean-Pierre Améris describes, with the light touch allowed by comedy, the nightmare experienced by those people who are so scared of life that they miss out on it, preferring the safety of doing nothing over the risks of taking action. And not taking action does not only bring frustration to the people concerned , it is also misleading to others. Deep inside themselves neither is Jean-René this gruff unpleasant boss nor Angélique this slightly retarded little girl. They are much better persons and deserve better. "Les émotifs anonymes" will thus recount Angélique and Jean René's desperate efforts to become a couple on the one hand and to become who they are on the other, describing the various means they use to this end (consulting a behavioral psychologist, doing exercises to try to ACT even if the odds seem impossible, using auto suggestion, trying to touch someone, to invite a person to the restaurant, joining a mutual aid movement such as the "Emotifs Anonymes" (hence the title)...\n\nA useful film for the overly timid, an entertaining and charming one for the more extrovert, "Les émotifs anonymes" is played to perfection by the ever delightful and fresh Isabelle Carré and cast- against-type Benoît Poelvoorde. There is such a chemistry between the two on-screen partners that you never doubt for a single moment that the princess can be infatuated with a bullfrog!\n\nA comedy with a heart, "Les émotifs anonymes" contains several scenes to remember : the disaster dinner at the restaurant, Jean-René singing 'Dark Eyes' to Angélique at the hotel, Jean-René's declaration of love to Angélique during an "Emotifs Anonymes" meeting.\n\nDon't be shy.

This statement is especially true for children whose goals and dreams are subject not only to the real problems they face but are in part determined by their parent's ability to handle their own life. Ira Sachs affecting drama, Little Men, looks at life from the point of view of two young men on the cusp of adolescence whose friendship is threatened by a family squabble that has no easy solution. Co-written by the director and Mauricio Zacharias, the film follows on the heels of Sachs' 2014 Love is Strange, the story of a gay couple and how they are forced to vacate their New York City residence as a result of gentrification, a theme that plays also role in Little Men.\n\n13-year-old boys, Jake (Theo Taplitz), a non-observing Jew and Tony (Michael Barbieri), who goes to Catholic school, are drawn together when Jake's parents, Brian (Greg Kinnear) and Kathy (Jennifer Ehle), move into an apartment in Brooklyn vacated by the death of Jake's grandfather. The apartment is located above a dress shop owned by his grandfather's long time friend, Chilean seamstress Leonor (Paulina Garcia, "Gloria"), who has been paying a lower rent as a result of their friendship. The boys possess exceptional artistic talent. Jake is a painter who hopes that his portfolio will land him in the LaGuardia School of the Performing Arts, even as his drawing of yellow stars against the background of a green sky is dismissed by his middle-brow, middle-school teacher.\n\nCompared to the sensitive Jake who keeps to himself and has few friends, Tony, an aspiring actor, is outgoing with excess energy to burn, a dynamo whose best scene is a back and forth exchange with his drama coach, an exercise in letting go of restraint and reaching for full self-expression. Speaking rapidly with a Brooklyn accent, Tony, who wants to join Jake in the LaGuardia School, puts on a good act of being on top of things but the sadness stemming from the lack of a father in his life is visible. One is reminded of the Nigerian poet and novelist Ben Okri's reflection that, "the need to create art is often connected to a need to heal something." Brian informs Leonor that he has to triple her rent because his acting roles bring in little money and he does not want to have to completely rely on his wife's income. Though he tries to reach an amicable agreement, his position strengthens Leonor's intransigence and encourages Brian's sister (Talia Balsam) to push for her eviction in order to bolster the family's income. As their families bicker, Jake and Tony try their best to stay away from the conflict, riding their roller blades and scooters around the neighborhood with joyous abandon to the energizing score of Dickon Hinchliffe suggesting that this moment of their youth will last forever. Unfortunately, however, their parents only dig in their heels, Leonor snarkily asserting that she was closer to Brian's father than he was and Kathy tells Leonor that she is trained in conflict resolution though she does not offer any such resolution.\n\nAs Jake and Tony's friendship becomes strained, they embark on their secret weapon - the silent treatment - but the children's weapons against their more powerful parent's ends, as it often does in heartfelt tears. Little Men is a thoughtful and moving film that contains some of the year's most honest and nuanced performances from Taplitz, Barbieri and Kinnear. There are no villains in the film and each character has what is on the surface a reasonable position, but what is lost is the compassion to step back and see things from a broader perspective, one that transcends immediate needs.\n\nBrian shows some awareness of this when he breaks down in tears while alone, suggesting that looking out for one's own self-interest while admirable in many respects may cut us off from relationships we cherish. Little Men operates on several levels. It is about gentrification and class interests, but its most potent message is about the miracle of friendship and coming to terms with growing up. Jake and Tony have found the kind of friendship that is rare for any age. Though they are different people with different interests, they have a bond that is akin to love, one that, like other attachments in life, will not last even though it will always contain moments so real that they may forever remain etched in the core of their being.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7187,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-04","keywords":"best friend,father son relationship,gentrification,eviction,teenage boy with a ponytail","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4158501913","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyOTUzNTIxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1MDM5ODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTAyOTUzNTIxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTE1MDM5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When 13-year-old Jake's grandfather dies, his family moves from Manhattan back into his father's old Brooklyn home.

It really impressed me there.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2013-04-24","keywords":"reference to jean paul sartre,water lily,philosophy,absurdism,surrealism","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4269714713","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyOTE1OTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEwMzk4MTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyOTE1OTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEwMzk4MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in a charmingly surreal Paris, wealthy bachelor Colin spends his time developing his pianocktail (a cocktail-making piano) and devouring otherworldly dishes prepared by his trusty chef Nicolas.

Have it take place 25 years earlier--1994 instead of 2019, before everyone had their own phone--and make the characters in their mid-30s instead of their early 20s.

At best he's competent at what he does, and some years back made a halfway clever and original 'movie'-comedy (Big Fat Liar), but mostly has kept to Fox studio commercialism like Cheaper by the Dozen and the Night at the Museum movies. And yet, he (or just the studio) must have had the insight to put together two of the funniest people working right now- not to mention with shows back-to-back on Thursday nights on NBC- Steve Carrel and Tina Fey, because they help elevate anyone's work by a longshot. This isn't to say that Josh Klausner's script may not have some laughs, but where exactly I can't be sure, since most of his contributions would appear to come from the super-conventional story aspects (as my own mother put it, "I don't know, looks like The Out of Towners, or that Blind Date movie from the 80's").\n\nSo yeah, basic premise, married couple looking for a little change (their friends are splitting up), go out to 'The City' (NYC of course) and to a very nice restaurant. In a move that could come out of a Seinfeld episode, they can't get a reservation so Carrel overhears a waitress calling for someone else for a reservation and he decides they should take it since they're no-shows. The "Tripplehorns", as it turns out, have some shady dealings with some bad dues with guns, and so the Fosters, our confused heroes, go on the run in the city. Whenever the movie focuses on the core plot of all of this, it's by the numbers stuff, save for a climax that ratchets up the absurdity of everyone involved (including good actors playing decent-to-mediocre baddies like William Fichtner and Ray Liotta).\n\nIt's when Fey and Carrel are allowed to play loose with the script that it strikes the iron. Their timing is impeccable, and they have chemistry together, which is crucial. And when they come across some other supporting characters, like Mark Wahlberg's (VERY) shirtless ex-military guy with all of his high-tech equipment, or the "real" Tripplehorns played by James Franco and Mila Kunis, there's further hilarity that ensues from the interactions and precise timing.

At best he's competent at what he does, and some years back made a halfway clever and original 'movie'-comedy (Big Fat Liar), but mostly has kept to Fox studio commercialism like Cheaper by the Dozen and the Night at the Museum movies. And yet, he (or just the studio) must have had the insight to put together two of the funniest people working right now- not to mention with shows back-to-back on Thursday nights on NBC- Steve Carrel and Tina Fey, because they help elevate anyone's work by a longshot. This isn't to say that Josh Klausner's script may not have some laughs, but where exactly I can't be sure, since most of his contributions would appear to come from the super-conventional story aspects (as my own mother put it, "I don't know, looks like The Out of Towners, or that Blind Date movie from the 80's").\n\nSo yeah, basic premise, married couple looking for a little change (their friends are splitting up), go out to 'The City' (NYC of course) and to a very nice restaurant. In a move that could come out of a Seinfeld episode, they can't get a reservation so Carrel overhears a waitress calling for someone else for a reservation and he decides they should take it since they're no-shows. The "Tripplehorns", as it turns out, have some shady dealings with some bad dues with guns, and so the Fosters, our confused heroes, go on the run in the city. Whenever the movie focuses on the core plot of all of this, it's by the numbers stuff, save for a climax that ratchets up the absurdity of everyone involved (including good actors playing decent-to-mediocre baddies like William Fichtner and Ray Liotta).\n\nIt's when Fey and Carrel are allowed to play loose with the script that it strikes the iron. Their timing is impeccable, and they have chemistry together, which is crucial. And when they come across some other supporting characters, like Mark Wahlberg's (VERY) shirtless ex-military guy with all of his high-tech equipment, or the "real" Tripplehorns played by James Franco and Mila Kunis, there's further hilarity that ensues from the interactions and precise timing. That's all you need sometimes in a comedy that's based in formula, is two character to at least semi care about (and, perhaps more wisely than a Hollywood rom-com can be given credit for, it has painfully normal characters here, nothing too complicated), and who are funny in semi-funny situations. Even a ridiculous car chase where the Fosters hit a cab and the two are connected bumper to bumper through the streets is funny just because of the acting. Given the right mood and timing they could read a census report and get a few chuckles from the pauses and inflections.\n\nSo, if you're looking for something masterfully done, look elsewhere. If you just want to see two stars who are funny be funny almost despite some of the limitations in the script, Date Night deserves a chance. At the least you get to see the two show off their "skills" in a strip-club scene, and, did I mention Mark Whalberg doesn't have on a shirt?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156642,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-04-09","keywords":"downtown,desire,thug,criminal,kingpin","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Date Night: International Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2353399065","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyMDQ0ODcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyMDQ0ODcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City, a case of mistaken identity turns a bored married couple's attempt at a glamorous and romantic evening into something more thrilling and dangerous.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275486/","name":"Tina Fey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158853/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458441/","name":"Josh Klausner"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

the grandparents may take them to the theaters because of their childhood nostalgia ; but it will do the trick only for little brats ; their elders would rather have more eventful tales .\n\n"Becassine " ,compared to such disasters in the comic-turned-movie such as "Spirou" ,"Boule Et Bill " , "Iznogood " or " Gaston" ,was made with care and can ,from that point of view,considered a successful work ; but as a character who's supposed to make you heartily laugh , it does not make it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":285,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2018-06-20","keywords":"comic book adaptation,bretagne france,france,breton,literary adaptation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3918052121","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGM3YmUxYzMtMDNhZS00Yzk5LWI2ZTItNGM4MTBjNGZhOGZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGM3YmUxYzMtMDNhZS00Yzk5LWI2ZTItNGM4MTBjNGZhOGZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1548080/","name":"Emeline Bayart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0895759/","name":"Karin Viard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9850111/","name":"Maya Compagnie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687913/","name":"Bruno Podalydès"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049689/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0247461/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044140/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687913/","name":"Bruno Podalydès"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683875/","name":"J.P.

the grandparents may take them to the theaters because of their childhood nostalgia ; but it will do the trick only for little brats ; their elders would rather have more eventful tales .\n\n"Becassine " ,compared to such disasters in the comic-turned-movie such as "Spirou" ,"Boule Et Bill " , "Iznogood " or " Gaston" ,was made with care and can ,from that point of view,considered a successful work ; but as a character who's supposed to make you heartily laugh , it does not make it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":285,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2018-06-20","keywords":"comic book adaptation,bretagne france,france,breton,literary adaptation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3918052121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGM3YmUxYzMtMDNhZS00Yzk5LWI2ZTItNGM4MTBjNGZhOGZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGM3YmUxYzMtMDNhZS00Yzk5LWI2ZTItNGM4MTBjNGZhOGZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1548080/","name":"Emeline Bayart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0895759/","name":"Karin Viard","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9850111/","name":"Maya Compagnie"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687913/","name":"Bruno Podalydès"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049689/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0247461/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044140/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687913/","name":"Bruno Podalydès","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683875/","name":"J.P.

The excellent mix of visual humor and claymation makes "A Grand Day Out," "The Wrong Trousers," and also "A Close Shave" some of the best animated footage ever put on television. Winning several Oscars and also countless other awards, Nick Park became quite the popular man in the U.K., yet his impact on the United States has not been big. After the third Wallace and Gromit short, there was all this speculation about a full-length Wallace and Gromit movie, yet for years nothing had happened. Then in 2000 instead of a full-length Wallace and Gromit film, we get another brilliant claymation film from Nick Park, which was Chicken Run, which almost got nominated for best picture in the Academy Awards. Perhaps it was the success of this film that ultimately drove Park to finally work on a Wallace and Gromit project.\n\n5 years later (these kinds of films do take long you know) and a lot of anticipation, Wallace and Gromit finally hits the big screen. Despite the rather weak trailers and marketing campaign, this movie delivers in so many ways. This film will be a delight for both kids and parents. With tons of adult humor hidden beneath the brilliant animation, Wallace and Gromit: Curse of the Were-Rabbit is one of the few films that perfectly manages to equally appeal to both kids and adults. This rather difficult technique is one that only Pixar has already perfected and DreamWorks has had a lot of trouble doing lately. Despite the DreamWorks logo slapped onto the poster, this film is mainly from the very creative staff of Aardman Animations.\n\nWallace and Gromit are first seen running a business that protects the townspeople's crops from being ruined by rabbits, which apparently had been running around wild and in great numbers lately. Their business has gotten them plenty of respect from the others living in the town because a gigantic vegetable contest was rapidly approaching and the crops needed protection. Complications arise when Wallace attempts to manipulate the rabbits into not liking vegetables and then a great eating machine is unleashed on the area. It is up to Wallace and Gromit to find the gigantic animal and stop it from eating away through gardens and also their approval from the townspeople. To add to that, Wallace wants to impress Lady Tottington, which also captured the attention of a snobby suitor by the name of Victor. Simple plot yes, but there is more than meets the eye, be prepared for a few fun surprises along the way, kind of like in the other Wallace and Gromit cartoons.\n\nIn animated films with little dialogue, it is the animation that has to set the pacing and the mood of the film. Despite requiring 5 years to produce only 85 minutes of footage, the payoff is fantastic. There is a massive amount of detail that requires more than one viewing to truly notice. Even more incredible than the detailed and nearly flawless animation is the truly unspeakable amount of visual humor put into the film. Whether it is a creatively placed shot or normal labels put into the funniest position possible, or it is the oh-so-adorable rabbits that is constantly shown in the film, most Curse of the Were-Rabbit's humor comes strictly from just watching the movie itself and catching all the references before it is too late. Just picture the movie Madagascar, except funnier much fewer pop culture references, and better animation.\n\nCasting was great, even though in a film with not much dialogue, it was not that important. Peter Sallis yet again does a wonderful job as Wallace, even though in this movie there was no stand-out quote that can be used anytime (The Wrong Trousers: "It's the wrong trousers Gromit, and they've gone wrong!"). Ralph Fiennes does a superb job as the lead villain Victor and also Helena Bonham Carter (known as the crazy female lead in the cult hit "Fight Club") lends her lovely voice as she plays Wallace's love interest. Even though nothing could top the final chase in "The Wrong Trousers," Curse of the Ware-Rabbit did have plenty of action scenes, including one fantastically done chase scene between Gromit and Victor's evil dog. Last but not least, the rabbits really steal the show at some moments. Whether it is their cute expressions, their funny movements, or their howling, the rabbits in the film even take some of the glory from the main stars. The funniest rabbit in the movie is the "cursed" rabbit himself, to the very end of the movie he had the audience rolling in laughter.\n\nBottom Line: Despite not being as memorable as "The Wrong Trousers", this film is just as good and entertaining as Chicken Run. Unlike almost every movie to come out this year, the movie does not drag at all, clocking in at a short 85 minutes yet containing so much joy and fun, it will leave everyone watching it asking for more. There is very little wrong with the film; it was a pure delight to watch. This film is a total contrast of the decent yet vulgar, uncut, raw movies that have made a surprising amount of money earlier this year (40-Year-Old Virgin, Wedding Crashers, and Sin City) and for families and those who want harmless entertainment; that is a good thing. Highly recommend, this is the top animated movie to come out this year and among the best we have seen this decade.

Again, Deschanel is an odd choice (another yank) but she is utterly spellbinding (oh the shower scene...hubba hubba).\n\nThe FX are great, both CGI and the Jim Henson creatures (the Vogons, brilliantly voiced by The League of Gentleman). The opening title song is worth the price of admission alone (think Eric Idle at his peak).\n\nSo I loved it, though the ending is also a bit of an anti-climax, but only perhaps because I was expecting something bigger. Still, it's p***-funny and that's the main thing.\n\nBest moment: Ford attacks the Vogons with a towel and foils them by closing a tiny garden gate ("Oh no!

The opening title song is worth the price of admission alone (think Eric Idle at his peak).\n\nSo I loved it, though the ending is also a bit of an anti-climax, but only perhaps because I was expecting something bigger. Still, it's p***-funny and that's the main thing.\n\nBest moment: Ford attacks the Vogons with a towel and foils them by closing a tiny garden gate ("Oh no! We'll have to go around!").","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191521,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-04-28","keywords":"hyperspace,robot,cow,norway,male alien","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1099150873","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDczOTg3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTIyMDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5NDczOTg3OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTIyMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005)","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293509/","name":"Martin Freeman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0080049/","name":"Yasiin Bey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1134029/","name":"Garth Jennings"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136709/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010930/","name":"Douglas Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456732/","name":"Karey Kirkpatrick"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The answer surprisingly is quite well,although the film does have flat spots and gags that somewhat misfire.The plot and incidents that take place are an obvious mixture and borrowing from the NAKED GUN and AUSTIN POWERS series of parodies,but what is refreshing is that the character of Johnny English is mostly free of the occasional mugging that was witnessed in the above films,and also Atkinson's MR BEAN creation,which was of course wordless but did sometimes engage in some rather messy slapstick.There is some messy slapstick here,but Atkinson's interpretation is closer to his greatest comic character of Edmund BLACKADDER,with his sometimes cynical and sarcastic tone,though he has traits of bumbling incompetence like Mr.Bean,though not total idiocy which makes English more sympathetic.A lower budget than the AUSTIN POWERS series means there are fewer elaborate set pieces,but some scenes work very well and there are some witty exchanges of dialogue.There's decent support from Natalie Imbruglia,Ben Miller and Tim Pigott-Smith,but John Malkovich is the most amusing as the villain with his cod French accent.It is encouraging to see a comedy which underplays it's scenes these days,rather than performers shouting and screaming in a desperate bid to force laughter out of an audience.That said,some scenes in the film don't always come off,perhaps because they are understated too much,but the best bits are very funny(especially the final scenes)and further sequels with this character would be most welcome.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153351,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-05-28","keywords":"swimming pool,based on commercial,queen elizabeth ii character,slapstick comedy,looking at oneself in a mirror","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Johnny English","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1284702489","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUwYmNkZmUtY2ZjMC00ZmM1LWEzMWMtNjE0NzY5NjI3OGI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUwYmNkZmUtY2ZjMC00ZmM1LWEzMWMtNjE0NzY5NjI3OGI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000100/","name":"Rowan Atkinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000518/","name":"John Malkovich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001386/","name":"Natalie Imbruglia"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0398185/","name":"Peter Howitt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204030/","name":"William Davies"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The answer surprisingly is quite well,although the film does have flat spots and gags that somewhat misfire.The plot and incidents that take place are an obvious mixture and borrowing from the NAKED GUN and AUSTIN POWERS series of parodies,but what is refreshing is that the character of Johnny English is mostly free of the occasional mugging that was witnessed in the above films,and also Atkinson's MR BEAN creation,which was of course wordless but did sometimes engage in some rather messy slapstick.There is some messy slapstick here,but Atkinson's interpretation is closer to his greatest comic character of Edmund BLACKADDER,with his sometimes cynical and sarcastic tone,though he has traits of bumbling incompetence like Mr.Bean,though not total idiocy which makes English more sympathetic.A lower budget than the AUSTIN POWERS series means there are fewer elaborate set pieces,but some scenes work very well and there are some witty exchanges of dialogue.There's decent support from Natalie Imbruglia,Ben Miller and Tim Pigott-Smith,but John Malkovich is the most amusing as the villain with his cod French accent.It is encouraging to see a comedy which underplays it's scenes these days,rather than performers shouting and screaming in a desperate bid to force laughter out of an audience.That said,some scenes in the film don't always come off,perhaps because they are understated too much,but the best bits are very funny(especially the final scenes)and further sequels with this character would be most welcome.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153351,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-05-28","keywords":"swimming pool,based on commercial,queen elizabeth ii character,slapstick comedy,looking at oneself in a mirror","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Johnny English","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1284702489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUwYmNkZmUtY2ZjMC00ZmM1LWEzMWMtNjE0NzY5NjI3OGI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUwYmNkZmUtY2ZjMC00ZmM1LWEzMWMtNjE0NzY5NjI3OGI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000100/","name":"Rowan Atkinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000518/","name":"John Malkovich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001386/","name":"Natalie Imbruglia"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0398185/","name":"Peter Howitt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0204030/","name":"William Davies"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

(I'm surprised it's not better known in the U.S., and suspect the issue is incomplete understanding of the language options, leading to the mis-conclusion that subtitles are necessary. -see below-) It's rather like another episode of "1001 Arabian Nights". Like any fairy tale, it plays fast and loose with time (16th century or 20th?) and place (Arabia or Persia?). There is no gore, very little blood, no glorification of violence, no double entendre talk (well one raised eyebrow once) ...and no "good guys" or animals die. Although it started out a bit slow and simple, I was soon pulled in so thoroughly I couldn't even contemplate pausing the DVD while I went to the bathroom.\n\nThe animation backgrounds appear to be typical 2D paintings, sometimes with multiple layers. Two things about the backgrounds stand out: First, they are highly detailed and variegated. And second, they use a lot of different strong colors at every opportunity - stained glass windows, meadow flowers, a spice market, dyed yarn, architectural tiles, geometric building decorations, etc. The magical figures appear to be 3D models, but so outrageously patterned and colored they're a feast for the eyes. The human figures also appear to be 3D models, but very simple ones, and in most cases projected as just simple flat areas of solid colors. Clothing mostly doesn't "drape", although flags, pennants, and sashes wave here and there.\n\nA couple effects are used especially well. One is the movement of point source lights. Walls and rooms subtly change color from one end to the other. Direct sunlight in the observatory is blinding. Fireflies light a scene. Darkened rooms gradually turn into brilliantly light ones as individual lights come on. And djinns cause showers of sparks. The other is swirling particles. Dust comes together into imagined figures (rather like seeing figures in the clouds). Fog envelops figures so thoroughly they disappear. A crystal prison shatters and the shards form an arch before disappearing.\n\nIn summary, the animation doesn't attempt to do 3D model animation better than Pixar, instead going off in a completely different direction. Rather than being clever and realistic, the animation flaunts its gorgeousness and the focus is on the story line. The figures are adequate to convey the story, but without any attempt to be marvels in their own right. Another difference from typical Pixar wannabes is there are no pop culture or current events references here; rather than presenting jokes every few tens of seconds, this animation relies simply on impeccable pacing of the story itself.\n\nThe "moral" of understanding diverse cultures and its benefits is hammered home again and again. Even the end credits call attention to the diverse cultures the animators came from.\n\nA perfectly serviceable English audio track exists; it was on the DVD I got from Netflix in late 2011. Younger viewers and others not comfortable with subtitles may find this the best way to make this animation accessible. The mismatch between mouth movements and the English audio is not distracting. This simpler view is complete and enjoyable; there's no need to understand any more.\n\nBut if you want to look a little deeper, it quickly becomes apparent that characters often switch between speaking French and speaking Arabic, sometimes even to different individuals in the same scene. Some of the jokes only halfway make sense if you're not aware of the language switches. And in a couple places the language switches are even relevant to the story line itself. Unless you know either French or Arabic, or have very quick ears, you may not be able to pick out all the language switches. The best way to understand them (for me at least) was to select "French" as the spoken language track and "English for the hearing impaired" (_not_ the regular "English") as the subtitle track. The "English for the hearing impaired" subtitles not only provide the dialog itself, but also indicate what language is being spoken. In fact, these subtitles are some of the best I've ever seen at conveying multi-lingual content."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3034,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2006-10-25","keywords":"racism,princess,nanny,lion,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3787964185","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRkYjk4ZWUtOGE0ZC00OGQ2LWI3MWMtY2E4OTUwOTkzZDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRkYjk4ZWUtOGE0ZC00OGQ2LWI3MWMtY2E4OTUwOTkzZDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0969770/","name":"Cyril Mourali"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1947858/","name":"Karim M'Riba"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007814/","name":"Hiam Abbass"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0643664/","name":"Michel Ocelot"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085679/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102807/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036163/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0643664/","name":"Michel Ocelot"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Younger viewers and others not comfortable with subtitles may find this the best way to make this animation accessible. The mismatch between mouth movements and the English audio is not distracting. This simpler view is complete and enjoyable; there's no need to understand any more.\n\nBut if you want to look a little deeper, it quickly becomes apparent that characters often switch between speaking French and speaking Arabic, sometimes even to different individuals in the same scene. Some of the jokes only halfway make sense if you're not aware of the language switches. And in a couple places the language switches are even relevant to the story line itself. Unless you know either French or Arabic, or have very quick ears, you may not be able to pick out all the language switches. The best way to understand them (for me at least) was to select "French" as the spoken language track and "English for the hearing impaired" (_not_ the regular "English") as the subtitle track. The "English for the hearing impaired" subtitles not only provide the dialog itself, but also indicate what language is being spoken. In fact, these subtitles are some of the best I've ever seen at conveying multi-lingual content.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3034,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2006-10-25","keywords":"racism,princess,nanny,lion,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3787964185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRkYjk4ZWUtOGE0ZC00OGQ2LWI3MWMtY2E4OTUwOTkzZDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGRkYjk4ZWUtOGE0ZC00OGQ2LWI3MWMtY2E4OTUwOTkzZDI3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0969770/","name":"Cyril Mourali","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1947858/","name":"Karim M'Riba","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0007814/","name":"Hiam Abbass"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0643664/","name":"Michel Ocelot"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085679/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102807/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036163/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0643664/","name":"Michel Ocelot"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And if you are, then know that my review is based on my fandom and in relation to the series itself. Therefore, it will be in the context of horror films, slasher films, and more importantly, the series itself. With that out of the way, who would have though the fifth film would be the one. Ever since the original, the series has sort of meandered around, trying to recapture the initial wonder of death playing the part of a slasher and killing off a group of people. \n\nYes, Final Destination 5 is truly the best sequel since the first. There hasn't been this much tension and creativity since the original, and practically every scene is filled with an uncomfortable level of anxiety. This is what the film has truly been missing, whether spoiled by the trailers before it or just a lack of creativity. For the most part, Final Destination 3 and 4 (TFD) lacked the necessary level of creativity and menace that was present in the first film, and even in the second. However, we have plenty of that here and a few nice twists as well. While the kills are also pretty ridiculous, most are plausible and, unlike TFD, should please fans with their level of gore and brutality.\n\nThe filmmaking qualities here reach above the standard the film has set. It looks great, with plenty of swift and enticing editing that will make your skin crawl with anticipation. The acting, while still not of any award winning caliber, or even really all that great, is decent enough here. The portrayals are more realistic this time around. While the film had though to settle into the I-found-the-answers-on-the-internet routine, here we have a smooth flow in which characters sort of lose their mind trying to figure things out. And while some might have called the main couple's relationship cringe worthy, I actually found it to be quite well played out as the couple has real issues they work through on top of everything that's going on. Suffice to say, it's nice to see the FD series making better attempts at developing it's characters. Still not great, but better.\n\nWith that said, this is Final Destination, and problems persist. Despite better attempts at character development, the majority still play fodder for death's machinations. Sure, we learn a little about them, but it's not any more than the bare minimum: this guys a jerk, that girls wild, etc etc. There is also one kill, in particular, that, while brutal, defies logic. Sure, it's FD, but there is a certain point of ridiculousness where the line is drawn. The characters trying to figure out what's going on is also getting old. There's certainly a reason here, which I won't spoil, why our characters don't know about what is happening in the same way characters from previous films know. But this leads to the problem of it being explained too quickly. This might contradict what I said above, but what I mean is that Tony Todd's character if far too quick to reveal information and the new twist. In comparison to FD1, where things had a slow, natural pacing, here we get a couple death scenes, and explanation, and then more death scenes. The progression is better, but still not as good as the first two films. \n\nFans will truly enjoy this solid sequel. There are a couple twists, and the final scene will blow everyone away. It's beyond what you would expect, and very nearly worth seeing the film alone. But with a handful of creative and brutal twists and a decently put together film, this should certainly warrant a decent box office and, maybe unfortunately, another sequel or two."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110636,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-08-12","keywords":"suspension bridge,gymnast,death of protagonist,eyeball run over by car,fall out window","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3590233113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Survivors of a suspension bridge collapse frantically work together to try and outwit Death and its sinister agenda."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194900/","name":"Nicholas D'Agosto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068187/","name":"Emma Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0260224/","name":"Arlen Escarpeta"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702797/","name":"Steven Quale"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0236019/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2104063/","name":"Eric Heisserer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714695/","name":"Jeffrey Reddick"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There's certainly a reason here, which I won't spoil, why our characters don't know about what is happening in the same way characters from previous films know. But this leads to the problem of it being explained too quickly. This might contradict what I said above, but what I mean is that Tony Todd's character if far too quick to reveal information and the new twist. In comparison to FD1, where things had a slow, natural pacing, here we get a couple death scenes, and explanation, and then more death scenes. The progression is better, but still not as good as the first two films. \n\nFans will truly enjoy this solid sequel. There are a couple twists, and the final scene will blow everyone away. It's beyond what you would expect, and very nearly worth seeing the film alone. But with a handful of creative and brutal twists and a decently put together film, this should certainly warrant a decent box office and, maybe unfortunately, another sequel or two.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":110636,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-08-12","keywords":"suspension bridge,gymnast,death of protagonist,eyeball run over by car,fall out window","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3590233113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA3NzY5Mzk3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjE4NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Survivors of a suspension bridge collapse frantically work together to try and outwit Death and its sinister agenda.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194900/","name":"Nicholas D'Agosto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068187/","name":"Emma Bell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0260224/","name":"Arlen Escarpeta"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702797/","name":"Steven Quale"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0236019/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2104063/","name":"Eric Heisserer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0714695/","name":"Jeffrey Reddick"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Writer/director/actor Edward Norton paid homage to the classics in this movie. Featuring an All-Star cast, there was no way he could lose with the characters' performances. I think that is the one drawback of the film, with such a stellar cast he had to give everyone time and the movie boasts a runtime of 2:24 minutes. A bit lengthy for a crime drama/who done it because there will be slower portions of the film. However, it was never boring and the dialogue is spot-on with the snappiness of Sin City but it doesn't come across as a caricature.

Writer/director/actor Edward Norton paid homage to the classics in this movie. Featuring an All-Star cast, there was no way he could lose with the characters' performances. I think that is the one drawback of the film, with such a stellar cast he had to give everyone time and the movie boasts a runtime of 2:24 minutes. A bit lengthy for a crime drama/who done it because there will be slower portions of the film. However, it was never boring and the dialogue is spot-on with the snappiness of Sin City but it doesn't come across as a caricature. A very entertaining film and please don't be emo like me and cry after the opening scene.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50065,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-11-01","keywords":"neo noir,1950s,jazz music,based on novel,detective","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi800112409","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ2YjJlYWItNjQxMi00ZWNjLTgxNjAtMzc4NTRmZjI3NTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ2YjJlYWItNjQxMi00ZWNjLTgxNjAtMzc4NTRmZjI3NTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set against the backdrop of 1950s New York, 'Motherless Brooklyn' follows Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton), a private detective living with Tourette Syndrome, as he ventures to solve the murder of his mentor and only friend, Frank Minna (Bruce Willis).

Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?\n\nDom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!\n\nBut then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy).

To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a "forger" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier. \n\nThere is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.\n\nLeonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! what a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.\n\nTo conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! \n\nMy Rating: 10/10\n\nThanks &amp; Regards","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2165826,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.\n\nTo conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! \n\nMy Rating: 10/10\n\nThanks &amp; Regards","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2165826,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Here, the serial murder is in keeping with a French nursery rhyme that deals with the big bad wolf. Unfortunately, this movie which is besides Delplanque's first movie is far from being successful. His movie takes back too many elements that became clichés of horror movies like the raven that is synonym of a bad omen, the haunted house and the serie of sinister-looking characters. But above all, the movie doesn't succeed in hiding an obvious lack of inspiration, especially the dialogs that aren't very worked  and it doesn't hesitate in borrowing scenes from other movies. I think about "the blair witch project" when one of the actors is disappearing into the woods and about "psycho" with the murder under the shower and moreover Delplanque's making is empty and hollow. Sometimes the movie becomes ridiculous due to a few scenes like the actors' show played in front of Axel de Fersen and Nicolas and a few characters: the cop who turns up at the most awkward moment hasn't got a cop's head and mind. As far as the little boy Nicolas is concerned, he is bad used. During an important part of the movie, he stays still, the vacant look  he seems scared by the big bad wolf and he doesn't say a single word. The little actor that epitomizes him hadn't had very much work to do.... Nevertheless Fraçois Berléand is quite convincing in his role of sinister-looking character even if the movie doesn't expand his feelings to Wilfried, one of the young men.

Here, the serial murder is in keeping with a French nursery rhyme that deals with the big bad wolf. Unfortunately, this movie which is besides Delplanque's first movie is far from being successful. His movie takes back too many elements that became clichés of horror movies like the raven that is synonym of a bad omen, the haunted house and the serie of sinister-looking characters. But above all, the movie doesn't succeed in hiding an obvious lack of inspiration, especially the dialogs that aren't very worked  and it doesn't hesitate in borrowing scenes from other movies. I think about "the blair witch project" when one of the actors is disappearing into the woods and about "psycho" with the murder under the shower and moreover Delplanque's making is empty and hollow. Sometimes the movie becomes ridiculous due to a few scenes like the actors' show played in front of Axel de Fersen and Nicolas and a few characters: the cop who turns up at the most awkward moment hasn't got a cop's head and mind. As far as the little boy Nicolas is concerned, he is bad used. During an important part of the movie, he stays still, the vacant look  he seems scared by the big bad wolf and he doesn't say a single word. The little actor that epitomizes him hadn't had very much work to do.... Nevertheless Fraçois Berléand is quite convincing in his role of sinister-looking character even if the movie doesn't expand his feelings to Wilfried, one of the young men. I noticed that Berléand seems to feel love to him.... At last, the movie succeeds, sometimes, in creating an ounce of suspense and doubt in the spectator's mind: who is the big bad wolf? Who is responsible of all the murders?

The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?\n\nDom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions.

His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If "Inception" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.\n\nTo conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan! \n\nMy Rating: 10/10\n\nThanks &amp; Regards","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2165826,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's kind of like watching a prude drooling over pornography while protesting to the world how evil it is.\n\nThe combat scenes are laughable.  The soldiers have the tactical acumen of a heard of sheep with assault rifles.  The movie doesn't just ignore significant aspects of the book, it goes out of its way to deliberately distort them.  A single example (one of many).  The protagonist of the novel, Johnny Rico, was a Filipino.  Verhoeven casts stereotypically Aryan Casper Van Dien as Johnny.  Is this a cynical distortion of the book to `prove' that the author wasn't `honoring diversity?'  Or is it a cynical marketing ploy to appeal to a particular demographic?  Or didn't Verhoeven care?\n\nThe movie's supporters seem to fall into three main categories.  There are those who enjoyed watching people being torn limb-from-limb while thinking `Gee, what a great science fiction action movie!'  There are those who justified watching people being torn limb-from-limb because they were thinking `Gee, what a clever satire of a militaristic society!'  And there are those in the first category who apparently had to see the movie more than once to move to the second category.  This is amazing to me since I thought the satire was about as subtle as a brick through a window."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":279150,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1997-11-07","keywords":"giant insect,space war,future war,military,insect","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Starship Troopers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1097905177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM0ZWRhZDctNmFiNS00NTUzLWI3NTYtNDQ2ZWE2N2Q4NzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM0ZWRhZDctNmFiNS00NTUzLWI3NTYtNDQ2ZWE2N2Q4NzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000680/","name":"Casper Van Dien"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000612/","name":"Denise Richards"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000539/","name":"Dina Meyer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000682/","name":"Paul Verhoeven"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065253/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0627159/","name":"Edward Neumeier"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0374423/","name":"Robert A.

It's kind of like watching a prude drooling over pornography while protesting to the world how evil it is.\n\nThe combat scenes are laughable.  The soldiers have the tactical acumen of a heard of sheep with assault rifles.  The movie doesn't just ignore significant aspects of the book, it goes out of its way to deliberately distort them.  A single example (one of many).  The protagonist of the novel, Johnny Rico, was a Filipino.  Verhoeven casts stereotypically Aryan Casper Van Dien as Johnny.  Is this a cynical distortion of the book to `prove' that the author wasn't `honoring diversity?'  Or is it a cynical marketing ploy to appeal to a particular demographic?  Or didn't Verhoeven care?\n\nThe movie's supporters seem to fall into three main categories.  There are those who enjoyed watching people being torn limb-from-limb while thinking `Gee, what a great science fiction action movie!'  There are those who justified watching people being torn limb-from-limb because they were thinking `Gee, what a clever satire of a militaristic society!'  And there are those in the first category who apparently had to see the movie more than once to move to the second category.  This is amazing to me since I thought the satire was about as subtle as a brick through a window.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":279150,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"1997-11-07","keywords":"giant insect,space war,future war,military,insect","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Starship Troopers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1097905177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM0ZWRhZDctNmFiNS00NTUzLWI3NTYtNDQ2ZWE2N2Q4NzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDM0ZWRhZDctNmFiNS00NTUzLWI3NTYtNDQ2ZWE2N2Q4NzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000680/","name":"Casper Van Dien","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000612/","name":"Denise Richards","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000539/","name":"Dina Meyer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000682/","name":"Paul Verhoeven"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065253/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0627159/","name":"Edward Neumeier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0374423/","name":"Robert A.

I did enjoy it to an extent; it was a bit slow-moving and there were some parts that needed some improvement, but it was overall a decent film. I do agree that Louis Letterier's 2008 film was a vast improvement, though. It improved on all of the issues I had with Lee's film. The film is a reboot of the dying franchise: Bruce Banner has been hiding in Brazil, attempting to keep a low profile while he searches for a cure for his condition, but General Ross becomes aware of his location and enlists the aid of Emil Blonsky, a soldier with a mean streak. A bit of non-sanctioned experimentation later and Blonsky becomes a creature rivaling even the Hulk in power.\n\nOne issue I had with Lee's 2003 film was the slow-pacing; the film felt as if it dragged forever between action scenes. It wasn't necessarily the fault of the cast, but seemed more to do with a story that didn't really grab me. Letterier's film amps up the excitement and interest levels a bit with a stronger story and better action sequences. The Hulk's fight against three gamma-irradiated dogs in the previous film doesn't even compare to the Hulk's battle against the Army on the college campus in this film. I didn't see the Hulk from 2003 as being overly-cartoonish in appearance but I can see how some others did. The new film gives the Hulk a grittier, stronger, more realistic style (as realistic as a 9-foot tall green giant can be) and the Abomination looks just as good.\n\nIn general, I also dug the new cast better than the previous. Ed Norton was great as Bruce Banner, giving him a great blend of meekness and inner strength. From what I understand, Norton is a huge fan of the source material so you know he must've given this role everything he had. I enjoyed Liv Tyler as Betty Ross, though there were times when I missed Jennifer Connelly, and Tim Roth has long been one of my favorite actors so it was great to see him go with the villainous side this time around as Blonsky. William Hurt was a fine General Ross though, just as Liv Tyler, there were times when I thought Sam Elliot would've put in a stronger performance (plus, there were a handful of instances where Hurt came off as over-acting a bit, in my opinion...).\n\nIt's great to have the character of the Hulk back in the hands of Marvel and they've done a great job of rejuvenating the franchise. I loved this film and, while it wasn't on par with 2008's Iron Man film, it was a great superhero flick. The action was brutal, the story was entertaining, and the cast was near perfect. My only real issue with the film was the ending; without going into detail, I thought the resolution of the final battle between the Hulk and Abomination was anti-climactic. I remember first watching the scene and the only thought that popped into my head was "That's IT?!". Otherwise, it's a great movie and a good way to spend two hours.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":455162,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2008-06-18","keywords":"marvel cinematic universe,based on comic,bruce banner character,reboot of series,scene during opening credits","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Incredible Hulk: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1726152985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ4Mzk5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDMyNjA3MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second trailer for The Incredible Hulk, directed by Louis Leterrier."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000239/","name":"Liv Tyler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051941/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0672015/","name":"Zak Penn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456158/","name":"Jack Kirby"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That said, thirty years before "Nos Jours Heureux", Claude Millers' debut film "La Meilleure Façon De Marcher" (1976) used this type of place as a backdrop to depict an ambiguous relationship between two counselors who were admirably portrayed by Patrick Deweare and Patrick Bouchitey. And at a pinch, one could also quote Gérard Jugnot's "Scout Toujours..." (1985).\n\nBut here, it's a true children's holiday camp that is depicted here. Set in 1992, a manager Vincent (Jean Paul Rouve) has to run a children's holiday camp for three weeks and to face the unexpected concerning the place, his colleagues, various problems linked to children about the rooms, trips, their belongings. Very often, what seem at first little problems end up becoming great ones which can sometimes be solved in a curious and humorist way.\n\nBecause it's the tone used by the two directors to relate these crazy three weeks. I must admit it's a shame they have recourse to clichés to depict several types of counselors between shy Caroline, seducing Lisa who doesn't leave Vincent indifferent, big mouth Daniel. OK, these stereotypes are the motors to several comical sequences but I would have liked more originality. The same goes for the kids between the witty one, the anguished one who keeps on asking a thousand questions about all and nothing. And of course, girls are one of their biggest interests during their holidays.\n\nThat said, the energy of the actors, the nostalgic look adopted by the directors, the funny ways big problems are solved or circumvented are enough to honestly have fun and to spend a really good time in front of this vibrant comedy although it is cluttered with clichés. But as they're not too overwhelming, one can forget them without any remorse. One will also forget a too cozy end.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3625,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"young love,summer vacation,summer camp,train,summer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4043619865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0OTA3N2QtZTcwMi00NjliLTgzM2ItNzFlNTg1MTkxNDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0OTA3N2QtZTcwMi00NjliLTgzM2ItNzFlNTg1MTkxNDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0077622/","name":"Marilou Berry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1082477/","name":"Omar Sy"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619923/","name":"Olivier Nakache"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865918/","name":"Éric Toledano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098808/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069340/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006560/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619923/","name":"Olivier Nakache"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865918/","name":"Éric Toledano"}],"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That said, thirty years before "Nos Jours Heureux", Claude Millers' debut film "La Meilleure Façon De Marcher" (1976) used this type of place as a backdrop to depict an ambiguous relationship between two counselors who were admirably portrayed by Patrick Deweare and Patrick Bouchitey. And at a pinch, one could also quote Gérard Jugnot's "Scout Toujours..." (1985).\n\nBut here, it's a true children's holiday camp that is depicted here. Set in 1992, a manager Vincent (Jean Paul Rouve) has to run a children's holiday camp for three weeks and to face the unexpected concerning the place, his colleagues, various problems linked to children about the rooms, trips, their belongings. Very often, what seem at first little problems end up becoming great ones which can sometimes be solved in a curious and humorist way.\n\nBecause it's the tone used by the two directors to relate these crazy three weeks. I must admit it's a shame they have recourse to clichés to depict several types of counselors between shy Caroline, seducing Lisa who doesn't leave Vincent indifferent, big mouth Daniel. OK, these stereotypes are the motors to several comical sequences but I would have liked more originality. The same goes for the kids between the witty one, the anguished one who keeps on asking a thousand questions about all and nothing. And of course, girls are one of their biggest interests during their holidays.\n\nThat said, the energy of the actors, the nostalgic look adopted by the directors, the funny ways big problems are solved or circumvented are enough to honestly have fun and to spend a really good time in front of this vibrant comedy although it is cluttered with clichés. But as they're not too overwhelming, one can forget them without any remorse. One will also forget a too cozy end.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3625,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"young love,summer vacation,summer camp,train,summer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4043619865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0OTA3N2QtZTcwMi00NjliLTgzM2ItNzFlNTg1MTkxNDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE0OTA3N2QtZTcwMi00NjliLTgzM2ItNzFlNTg1MTkxNDczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746162/","name":"Jean-Paul Rouve","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0077622/","name":"Marilou Berry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1082477/","name":"Omar Sy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619923/","name":"Olivier Nakache","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865918/","name":"Éric Toledano"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098808/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069340/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0006560/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0619923/","name":"Olivier Nakache","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865918/","name":"Éric Toledano"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Buck is an extremely likeable protagonist who goes on a compelling journey of self discovery. Despite being a dog and not having a word of dialogue, Buck is an incredibly interesting, three dimensional character with a well developed arc. The CGI used to bring him to life is amazing. While it doesn't always look natural, Buck's CGI model is so expressive and can cause the viewer to experience a variety of different emotions, despite not even being there. Harrison Ford also does well as the elderly, depressed John Thornton, carrying a great deal of tragedy and mystery about his past throughout the movie. The movie also features stunning cinematography, with several beautiful shots and camera angles. It's a true joy to look at. However, there are a few problems with the movie. For starters, John Thornton narrates a lot throughout the movie, despite not being present for, and therefore having no way of knowing about, the events that he's describing. Another issue is Dan Stevens' character; Hal. Hal is an entirely unnecessary, one dimensional antagonist, who just doesn't work with the story this movie is trying to tell. His presence also completely derails John Thornton's resolution. However, despite these problems, I still recommend The Call Of The Wild.

It's a fantastic movie, with an incredible protagonist and stunningly beautiful visuals that you shouldn't miss.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":43688,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2020-02-21","keywords":"1890s,remake,alaska,snow,dog","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi264945433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRjNGU1MDItMDcyZC00ZTNmLWI1Y2ItN2Q1NjE5YmQ5Yzg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRjNGU1MDItMDcyZC00ZTNmLWI1Y2ItN2Q1NjE5YmQ5Yzg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A sled dog struggles for survival in the Alaskan wild.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1082477/","name":"Omar Sy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4446254/","name":"Cara Gee"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0761498/","name":"Chris Sanders"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0781821/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0172422/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0518711/","name":"Jack London","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10950558/","name":"Egerton Ryerson Young"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Every once in a while, particularly during summer months when studios are rolling out their blockbuster hopefuls, you'll see a couple of movies released that seem to be mirror images of one-another. Not exactly the same, but similar enough that it seems like they must have some common ancestor.\n\nThe reason why this happens is pretty straight forward and has to do with the unusual way the movie industry works. Often, the scripts for movies aren't developed in-house by the studios, but rather purchased from freelance writers who come up with an idea and then "pitch" it to multiple studios looking for a buyer.\n\nThe process works for both the writers and the studios. There is a catch, however, which is that the person pitching relies upon a studio honoring an informal agreement not to use an idea without compensating the creator. The problem is that less scrupulous studio executives will have no problem passing on an idea and then blatantly copying it for their own movie. And even though everyone involved knows what's happening, it's pretty rare for anyone to actually sue over it, so it tends to keep happening.\n\nA famous example of this (famous in the relative sense) happened with the movies 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. The original author who pitched 'Deep Impact' watched a studio exec take copious notes during the pitch, pass on it, and then rush to create a script and get his ripped off version made in time to compete with 'Deep Impact', which was purchased by another studio.\n\nThis usually happens when someone creates a script that captures the zeitgeist; that taps into an idea that just clicks with what people are talking and thinking about and it becomes the "must have" idea of the year.\n\nUnless you're an industry insider, it can be difficult to know which movie was the original concept and which was the ripoff, but generally the original idea will be more polished and well thought out. 'Armageddon', for example, famously had such huge plot holes that the cast was complaining about them during filming.\n\n'Olympus Has Fallen' (OHF) came out around the same time as 'White House Down' (WHD). Both movies feature an attack on the white house with an invading force, aided by a turncoat secret service agent, conquering the presidential security in an attempt to take him hostage. Both movies also have a protagonist who isn't secret service, but has some connection to the agency and ultimately proves that he deserves to be guarding the president. Both movies involve protecting a child caught in the crossfire. Both have failed attempts by special forces to re-take the building. Both involve explosions that destroy the building. Both movies involve forcing a change to foreign policy. And so on, you get the idea.\n\nI don't know which was the original, but I have a guess. The movies were made during the presidency of Barack Obama. After he was elected, there was a lot of speculation about whether he would be the subject of an assassination attempt. To African Americans Obama represented an almost unbelievable event: one of their own elected to the most powerful office in the nation. And there was a great deal of angst about losing him violently, the way a number of prominent black leaders had been lost in the past. I think that was the kernel that sparked the original screenplay; this clash of the old power base and the new one in the symbolic seat of national power.\n\nTo my mind, WHD was the liberal take on the idea while OHF was the conservative counter. WHD featured a charismatic black president clearly modeled after Obama, right down to his attempts to quit smoking. The villains are white supremacist types backed by the old-guard military industrial complex who are fearful of the changes the president was making to foreign policy. And the protagonist is a millennial trying to prove he was worthy of the responsibility of protecting the president, perhaps an analogy for the young political activists that brought new methods of campaigning to Obama's election.\n\nOHF, by contrast, features a white male president with villains who were almost exclusively Asian, and rather than representing the supporters of the status quo they are actively looking to tear down American force abroad, suggesting that the bad guys can't stand how effective the traditional American foreign policy is. In other words, the message is "we are winning and they are getting desperate". Even the protagonist is more representative of the target audience: a middle-aged man with a penchant for defiantly vowing to destroy the villains and defend our way of life.\n\nNeither movie is particularly deep; it's mostly about the action sequences. In other words, these are popcorn movies. But I do think it's interesting how two such similar base ideas can manifest such different messages. While WHD is about the (then) rising tide of the progressive political movement and the supposed fear within groups that traditionally held power in the US, OHF is all about the traditional conservative message of Jingoism and the need to protect ourselves from the parts of the world that don't share our values.\n\nWhatever the case may be, OHF was successful enough to green light a second film 'London Has Fallen', which is a continuation of the themes, only with (primarily) middle-eastern villains instead of Asian ones, and an upcoming 'Angel Has Fallen'. Personally, I thought OHF was decent but unspectacular. I enjoyed it enough when I saw it on HBO or Netflix or wherever, but I probably wouldn't pay to see it in the theater.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"politics,political thriller,u.s. president,political assassination,white house","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exclusive Debut","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3461588761","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning finds himself trapped inside the White House in the wake of a terrorist attack; using his inside knowledge, Banning works with national security to rescue the President from his kidnappers."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001173/","name":"Aaron Eckhart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332840/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4950667/","name":"Creighton Rothenberger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4951717/","name":"Katrin Benedikt"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And there was a great deal of angst about losing him violently, the way a number of prominent black leaders had been lost in the past. I think that was the kernel that sparked the original screenplay; this clash of the old power base and the new one in the symbolic seat of national power.\n\nTo my mind, WHD was the liberal take on the idea while OHF was the conservative counter. WHD featured a charismatic black president clearly modeled after Obama, right down to his attempts to quit smoking. The villains are white supremacist types backed by the old-guard military industrial complex who are fearful of the changes the president was making to foreign policy. And the protagonist is a millennial trying to prove he was worthy of the responsibility of protecting the president, perhaps an analogy for the young political activists that brought new methods of campaigning to Obama's election.\n\nOHF, by contrast, features a white male president with villains who were almost exclusively Asian, and rather than representing the supporters of the status quo they are actively looking to tear down American force abroad, suggesting that the bad guys can't stand how effective the traditional American foreign policy is. In other words, the message is "we are winning and they are getting desperate". Even the protagonist is more representative of the target audience: a middle-aged man with a penchant for defiantly vowing to destroy the villains and defend our way of life.\n\nNeither movie is particularly deep; it's mostly about the action sequences. In other words, these are popcorn movies. But I do think it's interesting how two such similar base ideas can manifest such different messages. While WHD is about the (then) rising tide of the progressive political movement and the supposed fear within groups that traditionally held power in the US, OHF is all about the traditional conservative message of Jingoism and the need to protect ourselves from the parts of the world that don't share our values.\n\nWhatever the case may be, OHF was successful enough to green light a second film 'London Has Fallen', which is a continuation of the themes, only with (primarily) middle-eastern villains instead of Asian ones, and an upcoming 'Angel Has Fallen'. Personally, I thought OHF was decent but unspectacular. I enjoyed it enough when I saw it on HBO or Netflix or wherever, but I probably wouldn't pay to see it in the theater.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"politics,political thriller,u.s. president,political assassination,white house","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exclusive Debut","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3461588761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning finds himself trapped inside the White House in the wake of a terrorist attack; using his inside knowledge, Banning works with national security to rescue the President from his kidnappers.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001173/","name":"Aaron Eckhart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332840/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4950667/","name":"Creighton Rothenberger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4951717/","name":"Katrin Benedikt"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The con-man Philippe Miller (played distinctly with a confident restraint by François Cluzet) enters the town planning to pocket cash bribes paid out by suppliers in return for contracts. However Philippe ends up becoming emotionally involved with the inhabitants of the town, romantically with its major Stephane (Emmanuelle Devos) and counterintuitively decides to force through the construction. Not only for the sake of the people he supposedly employed, but also for a deeply rooted need of self-fulfillment.\n\nInitially cautious and reclusive with hints of petrification Philippe unwittingly dons the 'boss' cap in his rash attempt at profiteering only to discover to his dismay, that the hopes of the whole town are being placed on his shoulders. His revelatory "I've wasted too much time" highlights that personal gain is no longer essential, as he finds calm and happiness within his new role. The road he builds becomes a material accomplishment, a landmark to his success.

The con-man Philippe Miller (played distinctly with a confident restraint by François Cluzet) enters the town planning to pocket cash bribes paid out by suppliers in return for contracts. However Philippe ends up becoming emotionally involved with the inhabitants of the town, romantically with its major Stephane (Emmanuelle Devos) and counterintuitively decides to force through the construction. Not only for the sake of the people he supposedly employed, but also for a deeply rooted need of self-fulfillment.\n\nInitially cautious and reclusive with hints of petrification Philippe unwittingly dons the 'boss' cap in his rash attempt at profiteering only to discover to his dismay, that the hopes of the whole town are being placed on his shoulders. His revelatory "I've wasted too much time" highlights that personal gain is no longer essential, as he finds calm and happiness within his new role. The road he builds becomes a material accomplishment, a landmark to his success. (Shame that apparently in true-life the road had to be torn apart to avoid 'profiteering from illegal activities').\n\nNonetheless the dramatic impact has less to do with Philippe himself and more with the social turmoil initiated by the would-be builder's appearance. Despite various misgivings and warning signs none of them is followed through, as everyone becomes too involved in the change that is enacted.

    <desc lang="fr">Amateur de cinéma tendance Nouvelle Vague ou plutôt fan de Star Wars, adepte de Tarkovski ou de Jean-Marie Poiré, le bon polar avec détective met immanquablement tout le monde d'accord. Ce genre, les Anglais l'appellent le "whodunit" ("qui a fait le coup"), et les Américains, le "murder mystery". Directement inspiré des écrits de Conan Doyle, de Dorothy Sayers ou bien sûr d'Agatha Christie, le "whodunit" est un genre aussi vieux que le cinéma, mais toujours aussi populaire.</desc>

Ms. Foster really takes off in this entertaining cinematic offering in the sky! A good deal of time has passed since we saw her in Panic Room (2002), but for my taste, this FLIGHTPLAN proves itself as an even better vehicle to showcase her talent. The movie demonstrates similitude to a Hitchcock thriller from the golden age of Hollywood, both in style and in its storyline development. Guaranteed to keep you in respiratory crisis almost from start to finish! In the role of Kyle Pratt, aircraft engine engineer and mother of 6 year old Katerina, Foster shows tremendous range of nuanced emotion, in a performance that easily could have given her a fifth Oscar nomination. FLIGHTPLAN has a very smooth take-off, but does not take long to encounter serious turbulence.\n\nSoon after boarding an international flight, Kyle falls asleep, with her daughter alongside her. Upon waking, she discovers that Katerina, apparently, has disappeared without leaving so much as the slightest trace! Progressively, Jody Foster shows us an entire catalog of emotions. Concern and nervousness, followed sequentially by frustration; anguish and despair; then confusion and guilt; which ultimately give way to stoic resignation and unsettling doubts about her own sanity. The primary secret of FIGHTPLAN's success is that it enables the viewer to experience some of these emotions simultaneously right along with its lead character.\n\nUnfortunately, there is one black hole in the skies of FLIGHTPLAN. It's the kind of vacuum that prevents a "good" movie from being an absolutely phenomenal one! Without flying into any spoilers by divulging anything specific as to the identity of the on board bad guy(s), I will share the following with you: The team responsible for creating FLIGHTPLAN, in an extremely odd and inexplicable decision, chose not to reveal the slightest clue as to any of the background, history, formation, training, experience, MOTIVATION (outside of the $$$), previous or present internal conflicts, mental state and developmental thought processes of the villain(s)!\n\nThis lapse is even more striking when contrasted with the background provided for protagonist Jodie Foster's character, Kyle, whose personality is meticulously constructed, with deliberation and great attention to detail. Because of this, the bad guy(s) end-up projecting a kind of "Terminator-Light" image, seemingly lifted straight out of a comic book, thusly rendering the viewer totally indifferent to their intervention or plight in the film! The cast of FLIGHTPLAN, in general, submit solid and credible portrayals. Peter Sarsgaard, a veteran actor who has participated in numerous films, but who always has remained a bit under the radar in Hollywood, appears in a supporting role. His part is the most important one after Ms. Foster's. Sarsgaard's interpretation of a "Marshall" (a kind of national airways police) seems somewhat enigmatic and secretive.\n\nBess Wohl, who plays daughter, Katerina, has not had much on-screen experience, but is competent in her role as innocent child victim. As the pilot, we have Sean Bean, in a refreshing change of pace role. Most certainly recognizable owing to his turns as villain in several high profile films. He is quite convincing as the crew chief who gradually loses patience with a passenger who proves to be simply too problematic.\n\nIn 2005, few films managed to stay on top of box office for two consecutive weeks. This distinction is well-deserved in the case of FLIGHTPLAN, which was assigned a "PG -13" rating. It seems a great option for families with children over 8 or 9.

So chances were quite good that the production qualities would be somewhat uncertain, even being based on Patricia Highsmith's novel, the same author of "The Talented Mr. Ripley" (1999), amazingly adapted by Anthony Minghella and one of the finest movies of his career.\n\nAfter Minghella's adaptation, which was praised by everyone for its outstanding visual and technical qualities, and his skills to develop the story as a captivating and progressive dramatic thriller, also including a character that does not exist in the book that instead of negatively change the course of the story only increased the hitchcockian tone he gave to the plot, Hollywood didn't produced anything like that since then. \n\nWhen people watch the trailer of "The Two Faces of January" some honorable resemblances to Minghella's adaptation of Highsmith's Ripley will pop, and strong comparisons will be inevitable. That's what I felt, so my expectations were high. The attempts to repeat the same successful formula were so evident that one of the executive producers is Max Minghella, son of the late director. \n\nReally, the comparisons cannot be avoided, but rather to become nostalgic references or even an excellent opportunity to honor Minghella and his merits achieved by one of his greatest works, "Two Faces Of January" becomes a very frustrating experience in many aspects. \n\nThe condensed narrative, the thrilling moments involving the unknown past of each one of the characters and some key events that occur within the first half hour conducted by Alberto Iglesias music (with great references to Bernard Herrmann's in Psycho) clearly lead and prepare the viewer to a thrilling expected atmosphere. But unfortunately the robustness presented loses strength when the story achieves a shallow plateau that forgets to explore the past of each one of the characters as well as never taking truly advantage of their personal psychological conflicts as happen in the book, especially Rydal, the main character.\n\nThe title is a reference to Janus, a roman god with two faces, guardian of the transitions, doors, decisions and the beginning. One face looks to the past and the other to the future. This mythical figure represents the reckoning that Rydal is about to face and the dangerous decisions he will have to take. Also, the story take place in early January, which also means a new beginning in popular culture. In the book Highsmith makes clear those associations with the title when Rydal feels a strange and painful resemblance between Chester and his late father, and between Colette and a girl he was madly in love when a teenager. The transference he makes of these two strong figures of his life to Chester and Colette is what leads Rydal keeps himself close to them in the unconscious quest to solve his traumatic relationship with his hateful father and also try to continue an interrupted love interest he had in the past. \n\nBut in the movie, none of this fundamental matters are explored the way it should. There are only brief moments that loosely make clear Chester's resemblances to Rydal's late father but no major developments about that is given to clarify the reasons why the love-hate relationship grows so strong between them. Hossein makes it feels like all the love-hate relationship is because they share the same love interest: Colette. On the contrary of the psychological thriller that the book is, the movie makes it all a common passion crime flick, with silly police chasings, love triangle in the simplest possible way exploiting a naive Colette that does not exist, since the book makes reference to her recurring infidelity. The result is an empty movie with a trite ending that makes entire plot feels redundant rather than being Rydal's final journey in search for absolution over his most inner conflicts.\n\nEven developing an excellent job, Viggo Mortensen has his talent wasted here because of the forgettable film that it strikingly is. Kirsten Dunst seems to not yet have learned how to be sophisticated without always look like a college student, and as always, her best moments are when her character is under pressure. Wasted are also the locations in Greece and Turkey instead of doing the same thing Minghella did when making all the exuberance within the Italian landscapes an extra mix of beauty and soft cruelty in "The Talented Mr. Ripley". Oscar Isaac has impressive moments, perhaps because he did know the original work and also that his character is much more complex than the script provided, but for the viewer that is poorly cleared thru the 96 minutes, the attitudes of his character will feel just like an empty and romantically misplaced fixation without any coherent foundation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":30560,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Romance","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-05-16","keywords":"greece,ruins,athens greece,american in europe,foot chase","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2448730905","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MDQ0NTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk1MjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5MDQ0NTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzk1MjEzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"1962, Athens: Rydal, a young man acting as a tour guide while scamming visitors on the side gets entangled in the lives of Chester and Colette MacFarland, a seemingly glamorous American couple.

Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.\n\nWe first see Richard (played by Paul Walter Hauser in one of the year's best performances) as a supply clerk at a law firm in 1986. His awkward ways and surprising efficiency catches the eye of attorney Watson Bryant (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell), a quasi-connection that comes into play a decade later. We then jump ahead those 10 years to find Richard being fired from his campus security job at a college due to his over-zealous focus on protocol. Fortunately for Richard, the Olympics are coming to Atlanta, so finding work as a security guard is pretty easy.\n\nAtlanta's Centennial Olympic Park is shown with crowds of people cheering at a Kenny Rogers and later dancing the Macarena. As one of the on-site security guards, Richard spots a suspicious backpack that turns out to be holding the bomb that detonates, creating tragedy for many. As the viewing audience, we know that Richard's actions saved lives and he most definitely was not responsible for planting the bomb. And it's that knowing that places us as close as possible to the Richard Jewell experience.\n\nFour-time Oscar winner Clint Eastwood directs yet another story of a working-class hero. Only this time, he blatantly calls out what he sees as two evil forces: the U.S. Government (the FBI) and the media. Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, SHATTERED GLASS) based his script on the 1997 Vanity Fair article "American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell" by Marie Brenner (who also wrote the article that was the source for THE INSIDER, 1999). It can be argued that Eastwood comes down hard on the FBI and the media, but you might consider putting yourself in Richard Jewell's shoes before crying foul.\n\nJon Hamm has perfected the role of cocksure FBI agent and here he plays Tom Shaw as the man totally focused on proving Richard Jewell was the perpetrator. Much has been made of Eastwood's depiction of Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde, who directed this year's surprise hit BOOKSMART). It's a bit curious that the uproar is over what some interpret as a reporter trading intimate relations for a scoop, yet Eastwood's contempt seems focused more on the idea of trying a citizen's case in public ... while lacking any real evidence outside of a profile. The reporter (Ms. Scruggs passed away in 2001) is certainly portrayed as an ultra-aggressive reporter desperate for a headline story, but the implied consensual affair occurred after the inside information was provided - and the FBI agent was actually surprised... "Is this really going to happen?" Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.\n\nTwo key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right. A rush to judgment can be seen as an abuse of power, whether it's by the media, a law enforcement agency, or folks on social media. At this stage of his career, director Eastwood seems more interested in telling stories than showing one. He offers up little visual artistry outside of the terrific performances, but this story ... it's a doozy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74442,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.\n\nWe first see Richard (played by Paul Walter Hauser in one of the year's best performances) as a supply clerk at a law firm in 1986. His awkward ways and surprising efficiency catches the eye of attorney Watson Bryant (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell), a quasi-connection that comes into play a decade later. We then jump ahead those 10 years to find Richard being fired from his campus security job at a college due to his over-zealous focus on protocol. Fortunately for Richard, the Olympics are coming to Atlanta, so finding work as a security guard is pretty easy.\n\nAtlanta's Centennial Olympic Park is shown with crowds of people cheering at a Kenny Rogers and later dancing the Macarena. As one of the on-site security guards, Richard spots a suspicious backpack that turns out to be holding the bomb that detonates, creating tragedy for many. As the viewing audience, we know that Richard's actions saved lives and he most definitely was not responsible for planting the bomb. And it's that knowing that places us as close as possible to the Richard Jewell experience.\n\nFour-time Oscar winner Clint Eastwood directs yet another story of a working-class hero. Only this time, he blatantly calls out what he sees as two evil forces: the U.S. Government (the FBI) and the media. Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, SHATTERED GLASS) based his script on the 1997 Vanity Fair article "American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell" by Marie Brenner (who also wrote the article that was the source for THE INSIDER, 1999). It can be argued that Eastwood comes down hard on the FBI and the media, but you might consider putting yourself in Richard Jewell's shoes before crying foul.\n\nJon Hamm has perfected the role of cocksure FBI agent and here he plays Tom Shaw as the man totally focused on proving Richard Jewell was the perpetrator. Much has been made of Eastwood's depiction of Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde, who directed this year's surprise hit BOOKSMART). It's a bit curious that the uproar is over what some interpret as a reporter trading intimate relations for a scoop, yet Eastwood's contempt seems focused more on the idea of trying a citizen's case in public ... while lacking any real evidence outside of a profile. The reporter (Ms. Scruggs passed away in 2001) is certainly portrayed as an ultra-aggressive reporter desperate for a headline story, but the implied consensual affair occurred after the inside information was provided - and the FBI agent was actually surprised... "Is this really going to happen?" Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.\n\nTwo key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right. A rush to judgment can be seen as an abuse of power, whether it's by the media, a law enforcement agency, or folks on social media. At this stage of his career, director Eastwood seems more interested in telling stories than showing one. He offers up little visual artistry outside of the terrific performances, but this story ... it's a doozy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74442,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The action scenes are well crafted, loud, bloody and exciting, and the photography sparkles and the music soars.\n\nIf only the makers had put some thought into it, a bit of brains to go with the brawn. As a comic book type gangster piece, it works well on entertainment terms, elsewhere its lightweight and formula compliant, with the Ribisi, Patrick and Pena characters telegraphed a mile away.

The film reveals truth through taking the viewer on a journey to the past through the memories of people who witnessed the worst days of the conflict.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":56574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Documentary","Animation","Biography"],"datePublished":"2008-06-12","keywords":"lebanon,israel defense forces,animated documentary,mass murder,israel lebanon war","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Waltz with Bashir: Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3976855577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMDc3MTMyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg4NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMDc3MTMyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjg4NzYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for Waltz with Bashir, directed by  Ari Folman.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0284369/","name":"Ari Folman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2924645/","name":"Ron Ben-Yishai","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2923235/","name":"Ronny Dayag"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0284369/","name":"Ari Folman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0232356/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055455/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0284369/","name":"Ari Folman"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Otherwise this experiment in sociability and soulsearching has its charms.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":954,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-08-15","keywords":"summer,madrid spain,female protagonist,four word title,month in title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3108027417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYxY2JjZGYtZDNmZS00ZDU0LThmMzQtMWExZTY5NjM0OWE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTYxY2JjZGYtZDNmZS00ZDU0LThmMzQtMWExZTY5NjM0OWE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3188127/","name":"Itsaso Arana","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5229490/","name":"Vito Sanz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831099/","name":"Isabelle Stoffel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0343903/","name":"Jonás Trueba"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0531697/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0157422/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071642/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3188127/","name":"Itsaso Arana","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0343903/","name":"Jonás Trueba"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Not because the movies are the same or similar in that sense, but that they are both good. And this follow up is quite something - this time around it is a woman who is front and center ... and boy is she flawed ... no pun intended.\n\nSo many really good performances - and I don't say that lightly when it comes to German movies. While I generally am "known" for being too nice when it comes to rating movies (in general, I can be harsh too), I am quite critical of German efforts and mostly am not convinced when it comes to performances in the German language ... that makes me even more excited when it comes to movie like this one here.\n\nTo say that Lara is a flawed human being ... a broken one and one that commits and makes many mistakes would be quite the understatement. But that is also what makes her and the movie so interesting ... very well done indeed ...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1825,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2019-11-07","keywords":"60th birthday,mother son conflict,piano teacher,suicidal thoughts,mother son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi977779737","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY0MTNlYzktNWQxZi00MzRjLThmZTEtZjZlZjZjOWU4NjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDY0MTNlYzktNWQxZi00MzRjLThmZTEtZjZlZjZjOWU4NjZhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3605549/","name":"Mala Emde","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771713/","name":"Tom Schilling","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0090674/","name":"Rainer Bock"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1673756/","name":"Jan-Ole Gerster"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323020/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051615/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002254/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092424/","name":"Blaz Kutin"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

According to inequality org, the richest 1% of the world's population controls 45% of global wealth, whilst the poorest 64% of the population control less than 1% of the wealth. In 2018, Oxfam reported that the wealth of the 26 richest people in the world was equal to the combined wealth of the 3.5 billion poorest people. This is the milieu of Greed, a hilarious satire from prolific genre-hopping writer/director Michael Winterbottom. Examining how the rich get richer, the film focuses on a successful British clothing entrepreneur, and its bread and butter is the concomitant grotesquery that results when an individual has the same wealth as a small country. Mixing send-up and satire with more serious socio-economic points, Greed doesn't really do or say a huge amount that hasn't been done or said before, but it's entertaining, amusing, and undeniably relevant.\n\nSir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan) is one of Britain's richest men. The perma-tanned "self-made" billionaire is the owner of several clothing chains and is known as "the King of the High Street", although a less complimentary nickname is "Greedy" McCreadie. The non-linear narrative depicts 1) his rise to power, when, as a young man (played by a wonderfully loathsome Jamie Blackley), he opens multiple businesses (all of which fail) as he learns the ins and outs of asset-stripping and the importance of using foreign sweatshops; 2) in the modern-day, we see him hauled before a Parliamentary Select Committee convened to investigate the bankruptcy of one of his chains; and, 3) in the film's present, on the Greek island of Mykonos, the final (chaotic) touches are being put to McCreadie's Roman-themed 60th birthday bash - complete with mandatory togas, a fake coliseum, and a real, albeit somnolent, lion. Much of the story is told through the lens of McCreadie's "official biographer" Nick (David Mitchell), a classically-trained literature buff who drops quotes from Shakespeare and Shelley into everyday conversation, and who hates himself for agreeing to write a fawning celebration of McCreadie.\n\nThe idea that a billionaire could be so cut off from workaday reality as to stage a Roman-themed birthday party on a Greek island may sound far too on the nose, too ridiculously hubristic to say anything of any worth, too over-the-top to even function as satire. However, McCreadie is based on Sir Philip Green, chairman of the Arcadia Group, avoider of taxes, exploiter of the working-class, asset-stripper, and enemy of the #MeToo movement. Similarly, many of the details of McCreadie's ludicrous birthday are lifted verbatim from Green's very real 50th birthday celebrations in 2002 - when he flew 219 guests to Cyprus for a three-day toga party.\n\nMcCreadie, of course, is a hilariously despicable slimeball, a man who unironically feels hard done by when Syrian refugees show up on the (public) beach he's using for his birthday, and both Coogan and Blackley portray him as not only narcissistic and void of conscience, but as a completely classless philistine - whereas Nick, for example, can quote Shakespeare and recite Shelley, lofty symbols of Englishness both, McCreadie proudly gets his cultural know-how from BrainyQuote. However, the important point is that for all his loathsomeness, McCreadie is a symbol for the system that gave rise to and sustains him. For all his crass hubristic excess, McCreadie is neither an aberrant individual nor is he a criminal - he's an especially vulgar product of the system. And, with the crushing defeat of Labour in the 2019 English general election, it seems he's the product of a system which the vast majority of people appear to support.\n\nThe film gets pretty serious towards the end, and before the closing credits, a series of title cards detail some of the facts and figures of global economic disparity, particularly concerning the vast gulf between those who make the clothes we wear and those who sell them to us. Originally, these cards named specific brands as especially guilty of exploiting sweatshop employees, pointing out, for example, that workers in Myanmar earn $3.60 a day making clothes for H&amp;M, whilst owner Stefan Persson is worth $18 billion, and workers in Bangladesh earn $2.84 a day making clothes for Zara, whilst owner Amancio Ortega is worth $68 billion. However, Sony Pictures International, which financed the film with Film4, refused to allow Winterbottom to use these cards, with company head Laine Kline telling him, "we're worried about the potential damage to Sony's corporate relations with these brands". And so replacement cards were used, which feature much of the same information but without reference to any specific companies or people. So how do we know what the original cards said? Because Winterbottom, very much in the viciously sardonic spirit of the film, read them out on-stage after the world première in Toronto! Kline, who was in the audience, was far from impressed, which may account for the shoddy advertising campaign, with the film being released into theatres with virtually no market awareness. Whatever the case, Kline seems unaware of the irony of his actions - in relation to a film which accuses the rich of all manner of shenanigans to insulate and protect themselves and their fortunes, a massive corporate entity has exerted its authority to protect other massive corporate entities. It's like something McCreadie himself would do.\n\nAesthetically, the film employs a plethora of techniques, including non-linear editing, direct-to-camera addresses, YouTube videos to provide exposition, split-screen, fake news footage, and title cards. However, it's at its most effective when at its simplest, particularly in scenes involving the wonderful Dinita Gohil as McCreadie's overworked, under-appreciated PA. Amanda's interactions with Nick provide the emotional core of the story, and there's nothing bombastic or ostentatious about their construction - it's all simple shot/counter-shot editing and blocking. And by far the film's best sequence, which comes towards the end, is another simple setup involving Amanda and McCreadie, wherein the scene tells its story not through aesthetic construction or even through dialogue, but through the expression on Gohil's face. It's the moment during which Winterbottom drops all pretence of comedy and focuses on the more serious issues that have hovered at the fringes since the opening seconds.\n\nIf I were to focus on any one problem, it would be two underdeveloped subplots. A (staged) reality TV show subplot involving McCreadie's daughter Lily (Sophie Cookson) provides for some very funny individual moments, but it contributes nothing whatsoever to the main plot. Additionally, the fact that McCreadie and his ex-wife Samantha (Isla Fisher) are still in love with one another is a theme which never really goes anywhere, which is a shame, as it could have provided some much-needed character development for her and some shades of grey for him.\n\nFor better or worse, we live in an age where there are more billionaires than ever before, and Greed is a comedy about the excess and disconnect of such people. However, so too is it a cautionary tale, a reminder that just because we're removed from exploitation doesn't mean such exploitation isn't happening.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5829,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-02-21","keywords":"husband wife relationship,fashion industry,fashion show,flashback within a flashback within a flashback,greece","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3277897497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Greed' tells the story of self-made British billionaire Sir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan), whose retail empire is in crisis.

However, so too is it a cautionary tale, a reminder that just because we're removed from exploitation doesn't mean such exploitation isn't happening.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5829,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-02-21","keywords":"husband wife relationship,fashion industry,fashion show,flashback within a flashback within a flashback,greece","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3277897497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmE3YTYwNTItZDYwNy00OTk5LTg4MGEtZjFhMDMxMzJmYTM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Greed' tells the story of self-made British billionaire Sir Richard McCreadie (Steve Coogan), whose retail empire is in crisis. For 30 years he has ruled the world of retail fashion – bringing the high street to the catwalk and the catwalk to the high street – but after a damaging public inquiry, his image is tarnished. To save his reputation, he decides to bounce back with a highly publicized and extravagant party celebrating his 60th birthday on the Greek island of Mykonos. A satire on the grotesque inequality of wealth in the fashion industry, the film sees McCreadie’s rise and fall through the eyes of his biographer, Nick (David Mitchell).\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1102585/","name":"Caroline Flack","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176869/","name":"Steve Coogan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593267/","name":"David Mitchell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935863/","name":"Michael Winterbottom"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103733/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0660299/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935863/","name":"Michael Winterbottom","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2366133/","name":"Sean Gray"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Looking at the implosion of a family from the perspective of a 14-year-old member of said family, the film is thematically similar to Revolutionary Road (2008) and Blue Valentine (2010), and aesthetically similar to the Texas scenes in The Tree of Life (2011) (the period detail drips off the screen, whilst the use of a child as the focaliser colours much of what's depicted). And although Wildlife is a piece of remarkably nostalgic filmmaking, at the same time, it tells somewhat of a progressive story, demonstrating the uncertainty with which second-wave feminism manifested itself at a grassroots level prior to really taking off in 1963. Although it's essentially a character study, the film also suggests the 1950s-style clean-cut, neatly trimmed, rigidly defined way of life, built around the perfect nuclear family wherein a wife must be subservient to her husband, is about to become a thing of the past.\n\nSet in Great Falls, Montana in 1960, the film tells the story of the peripatetic Brinson family; father Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal), mother Jeannette (Carey Mulligan), and 14-year-old son Joe (Ed Oxenbould). When Jerry loses his job and takes off in a misguided attempt to reaffirm his masculinity by fighting a forest fire, something is awoken in Jeanette, who, for the first time, allows herself to admit she has become deeply unhappy, and overnight, her behaviour changes dramatically, as she rebels against her domesticity. Determined to forge a new identity, she is adamant she won't become one of the "standing dead" (the term used for trees that survive a forest fire).\n\nImportantly, the film is set three years prior to Betty Friedan's ground-breaking The Feminine Mystique (1963), which redefined the parameters of all gender-based topics, depicting a society in which women were no longer content to do their husband's bidding and raise children. Initially, Jeanette is depicted as a quintessential 1950s wife and mother, almost to the point of cliché; she cooks, cleans, washes the clothes, does the dishes, sees that Joe attend to his homework, and when Jerry loses his job, it is Jeanette who goes out looking for work for both of them. She knows that her (unspoken and unacknowledged) role in this patriarchal society is to hold the family together, but it's a role that is nothing like she thought it would be when she was younger. Although she and Jerry seem to love one another, or they certainly used to, she clearly feels trapped by her domestic situation.\n\nThat her transformation happens so quickly is the key point; when she goes to bed, she's a wife and mother, trapped in her domestic environment, but when she wakes the next morning, she realises that she has an opportunity to escape, perhaps the best opportunity she will ever get. This has been building up for years, but she has gotten so used to feeling lost that when she gets a chance to change things, she doesn't even recognise it as such, at least not at first. Once she does, however, Jeanette makes a conscious decision to stop performing the role delegated by men. As much of the female population of the western hemisphere would be asking over the next ten or so years, Jeanette wants to know, "is this all there is?" She wants more than simply getting through the day. In this sense, she recalls Nora Helmer from Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House (1879), or any number of Tennessee Williams heroines - a woman who wakes up to find she has become deeply unhappy despite attaining everything she once wanted, and who sets out to do whatever it takes to alter her course.\n\nThat all is not well in the Brinson household is hinted at in the opening scene, where Jerry and Jeanette have a couple of inconsequential but noticeable disagreements over dinner (such as whether Joe should continue pursuing football). This scene establishes an assuredness and subtlety-of-hand that lasts for the entire film, with Dano's directorial work proving unexpectedly sophisticated. For example, something he does several times is have characters walk off-screen to speak, whilst keeping the camera trained on Joe as he tries to listen, with the dialogue barely perceptible from just off the edge of the frame. As well as being an excellent use of off-screen space, something you don't see too often, this technique ties us rigidly to Joe's POV early on, inculcating us into his worldview. Another very nice piece of direction is an early montage cutting between Jeanette riding her bike, Jerry driving the car, and Joe riding the bus, in which each character is facing a different direction, each in isolation from the other two. It's basic cinematic shorthand, showing instead of telling, but it's very well done. Equally impressive is the penultimate scene, where Dano uses the windows of the Brinson house to block the characters in such a way as to suggest both their inner emotions, and the prevailing theme at this point of the film. For the most part, however, Dano's direction is invisible, relying far more on static painterly compositions than camera movement.\n\nThe acting, as you would expect, is universally superb. On paper, Jeanette and Warren Miller (a superb Bill Camp), an older man who becomes romantically interested in her, are very much the villains of the piece, but Mulligan and Camp's performances are so full of warmth and genuine emotion that you simply can't look at them as antagonists, and the film itself never judges them. Mulligan plays Jeanette as utterly weary, much older than her years, at times fragile, at times rock solid, both vulnerable and manipulative. Full of anger, she simply can't hold in her emotions any more. Unfortunately, in letting them out, she betrays Joe by forgetting he is only 14-years-old. When she starts drunkenly dancing with him at Miller's house, the scene is deeply uncomfortable, but Mulligan's performance is such that we don't condemn her, at least, not completely. She never allows the audience to lose sight of the fact that although she is behaving rather poorly, she is a prisoner, and is reacting against her restraints as best she can.\n\nOf course, there are a few problems. Essentially a tale of marital angst, the narrative is not especially original - we've seen this story before, many times in fact, and for all the craft on display, Dano never really manages to say anything wholly new. Additionally, his measured direction is also too good in places - everything is so ordered, neat, and trim, that at times, the milieu doesn't seem lived-in, but more an abstract concept of what the period was like. Additionally, there are a few lines that sound great on paper, but which are just not the kind of things one says in real life. For example, Jeanette tells Joe, "I feel like I need to wake up, but I don't know what from, or what to". Later she says, "I wish I was dead. If you have a better plan for me, tell me. Maybe it'll be better than this". This kind of dialogue seems more interested in hitting thematic waypoints than developing character beats. Similarly, late in the film, Jerry says to Joe, "It's a wild life. Isn't it, son?" Proclaiming the film's title in this context doesn't even remotely work, and the line feels totally out of place, to the point of ripping you out of the narrative.\n\nOn the one hand, Wildlife is about how society was changing in 1960, and on the other, about how that change manifests itself within the Brinson family. Yes, it's another "death of the American dream" story in a long line of such films, but here, the focus is, for the most part, on character rather than theme, with Jeanette functioning in kind of a synecdochical manner; our specific entry point, she is the individual that facilitates an examination of the masses. And yes, Dano may take his eye off the ball a couple of times, with the odd bit of clunky dialogue, and a somewhat too picture-postcard perfection, but all in all, this is an excellent directorial debut.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":26988,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-01-01","keywords":"1960s,unemployment,photography,infidelity,firefighter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1986312985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTAzZTk4MDQtZWIyZS00MDMyLTkyNTgtMjU0MDA0YWRlN2I4XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A boy witnesses his parents' marriage falling apart after his mother finds another man."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4590837/","name":"Ed Oxenbould"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350453/","name":"Jake Gyllenhaal"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659547/","name":"Carey Mulligan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0585931/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0564372/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625497/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1443740/","name":"Zoe Kazan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285840/","name":"Richard Ford"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Looking at the implosion of a family from the perspective of a 14-year-old member of said family, the film is thematically similar to Revolutionary Road (2008) and Blue Valentine (2010), and aesthetically similar to the Texas scenes in The Tree of Life (2011) (the period detail drips off the screen, whilst the use of a child as the focaliser colours much of what's depicted). And although Wildlife is a piece of remarkably nostalgic filmmaking, at the same time, it tells somewhat of a progressive story, demonstrating the uncertainty with which second-wave feminism manifested itself at a grassroots level prior to really taking off in 1963. Although it's essentially a character study, the film also suggests the 1950s-style clean-cut, neatly trimmed, rigidly defined way of life, built around the perfect nuclear family wherein a wife must be subservient to her husband, is about to become a thing of the past.\n\nSet in Great Falls, Montana in 1960, the film tells the story of the peripatetic Brinson family; father Jerry (Jake Gyllenhaal), mother Jeannette (Carey Mulligan), and 14-year-old son Joe (Ed Oxenbould). When Jerry loses his job and takes off in a misguided attempt to reaffirm his masculinity by fighting a forest fire, something is awoken in Jeanette, who, for the first time, allows herself to admit she has become deeply unhappy, and overnight, her behaviour changes dramatically, as she rebels against her domesticity. Determined to forge a new identity, she is adamant she won't become one of the "standing dead" (the term used for trees that survive a forest fire).\n\nImportantly, the film is set three years prior to Betty Friedan's ground-breaking The Feminine Mystique (1963), which redefined the parameters of all gender-based topics, depicting a society in which women were no longer content to do their husband's bidding and raise children. Initially, Jeanette is depicted as a quintessential 1950s wife and mother, almost to the point of cliché; she cooks, cleans, washes the clothes, does the dishes, sees that Joe attend to his homework, and when Jerry loses his job, it is Jeanette who goes out looking for work for both of them. She knows that her (unspoken and unacknowledged) role in this patriarchal society is to hold the family together, but it's a role that is nothing like she thought it would be when she was younger. Although she and Jerry seem to love one another, or they certainly used to, she clearly feels trapped by her domestic situation.\n\nThat her transformation happens so quickly is the key point; when she goes to bed, she's a wife and mother, trapped in her domestic environment, but when she wakes the next morning, she realises that she has an opportunity to escape, perhaps the best opportunity she will ever get. This has been building up for years, but she has gotten so used to feeling lost that when she gets a chance to change things, she doesn't even recognise it as such, at least not at first. Once she does, however, Jeanette makes a conscious decision to stop performing the role delegated by men. As much of the female population of the western hemisphere would be asking over the next ten or so years, Jeanette wants to know, "is this all there is?" She wants more than simply getting through the day. In this sense, she recalls Nora Helmer from Henrik Ibsen's A Doll's House (1879), or any number of Tennessee Williams heroines - a woman who wakes up to find she has become deeply unhappy despite attaining everything she once wanted, and who sets out to do whatever it takes to alter her course.\n\nThat all is not well in the Brinson household is hinted at in the opening scene, where Jerry and Jeanette have a couple of inconsequential but noticeable disagreements over dinner (such as whether Joe should continue pursuing football). This scene establishes an assuredness and subtlety-of-hand that lasts for the entire film, with Dano's directorial work proving unexpectedly sophisticated. For example, something he does several times is have characters walk off-screen to speak, whilst keeping the camera trained on Joe as he tries to listen, with the dialogue barely perceptible from just off the edge of the frame. As well as being an excellent use of off-screen space, something you don't see too often, this technique ties us rigidly to Joe's POV early on, inculcating us into his worldview. Another very nice piece of direction is an early montage cutting between Jeanette riding her bike, Jerry driving the car, and Joe riding the bus, in which each character is facing a different direction, each in isolation from the other two. It's basic cinematic shorthand, showing instead of telling, but it's very well done.

Full of anger, she simply can't hold in her emotions any more. Unfortunately, in letting them out, she betrays Joe by forgetting he is only 14-years-old. When she starts drunkenly dancing with him at Miller's house, the scene is deeply uncomfortable, but Mulligan's performance is such that we don't condemn her, at least, not completely. She never allows the audience to lose sight of the fact that although she is behaving rather poorly, she is a prisoner, and is reacting against her restraints as best she can.\n\nOf course, there are a few problems.

As person expecting to see fewer years than I have already seen I appreciate films that reflect some of what I have experienced - and some of which I wish I had experienced. Movies such as these remind us, also, of the value of looking ahead to what life can hold no matter the number of years that have crinkled your brows.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13505,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-07-25","keywords":"cell phone video,aerial camera shot,woman wears eyeglasses,movie flop,neighbor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"And So It Goes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3315841561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDUxNjFmNTctMjRmYy00ZmMxLTliNmYtYjE3ZWUwZWE4NjI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDUxNjFmNTctMjRmYy00ZmMxLTliNmYtYjE3ZWUwZWE4NjI0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for And So It Goes","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000473/","name":"Diane Keaton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3606106/","name":"Sterling Jerins"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001661/","name":"Rob Reiner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0485509/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242732/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0029125/","name":"Mark Andrus"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Let's define difficult, shall we? Is it difficult to see the first openly gay politician gunned down by his closeted colleague? Is it difficult to see a reformed convict put to death by our country for his crimes? Is it difficult to see a mother choose which one of her children dies during the Holocaust? I'd argue that these answers add up to a resounding yes. Yet, no one threw those phrases of "too difficult" around.\n\nI've watched hundreds of films throughout my short 29-year history and I've seen some difficult cinema. Steven Spielberg's "Schindler's List" can make anyone quiver in shame as it shows the despicable reality of the Holocaust. Paul Greengrass' "United 93", which is almost an emotional biopic of America's darkest hour, makes me want to crawl up into a ball and cry. And finally, Mel Gibson's "The Passion of the Christ", one of the highest grossing films of all-time, shows the labor of our sins fleshed out into the beaten skin of an honest man. And still, no one threw these hyperbolic terms out saying, "it's too hard watch." Is it because this is an American tragedy, done by Americans? Is it the guilt of someone's ancestors manifesting it in your tear ducts? I can't answer that. Only the person who says it can. The structure of this country is built on the backs and blood of slaves. But slavery didn't just exist in America, it was everywhere. It was horrifying what occurred for over 200 years and believe it or not, still exists in some parts of the world TODAY.\n\nNow when approaching the powerful film by McQueen and distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, there is a resounding honesty that McQueen and screenwriter John Ridley inhabit. There are no tricks or gimmicks, no cheap takes on a side story or character that is put there for time filling or a life-lesson for Solomon to learn. Everything is genuine. Is the film heartbreaking? Oh my God yes. Did I cry for several minutes after the screening? Embarrassingly so. I was enamored the entire time, head to toe, moment to moment.\n\nI have long admired the talent that's been evident in the works of Chiwetel Ejiofor. I've known he was capable of what he has accomplished as Solomon Northup and he hits it out of the park. He has the urgency, worry, and drive to get home to his family and executes every emotion flawlessly even when all hope seems to be lost. Where he shines incredibly are the small nuances that he takes as the story slows down, you notice aspects of Solomon that make him even more believable.\n\nAs Edwin Epps, Solomon's last owner, Michael Fassbender digs down deep into some evil territory. Acts as the "Amon Goeth" of our tale, he is exactly what you'd expect a person who believes this should be a way of life to behave. He's vile and strikes fear into not only the people he interacts with but with the viewers who watch. As Mrs. Epps, Sarah Paulson is just as wretched. Abusive, conniving, entitled, and I loved every second of her.\n\nMark my words; Lupita Nyong'o is the emotional epicenter of the entire film. The heartache, tears, and anger that will grow inside during the feature will have our beautiful "Patsey" at the core. She is the great find of our film year and will surely go on to more dynamic and passionate projects in the future. You're watching the birth of a star.\n\nHans Zimmer puts forth a very pronounced score, enriched with all the subtle ticks that strike the chords of tone. One thing that cannot be denied is the exquisite camera work of Sean Bobbit. Weaving through the parts of boat and then through the grassroots of a cotton field, he puts himself in the leagues of Roger Deakins and Seamus McGarvey as one of the most innovative and exciting DP's in the business. Especially following his work in "The Place Beyond the Pines" earlier this year. Simply marvelous.\n\nOscar chances, since I know many of you are wondering. Put the Oscar's in my hands, you have a dozen nominations reap for the taking. Best Picture, Director, Lead Actor, Supporting Actor, dual Supporting Actresses, Adapted Screenplay, Production Design, Cinematography, Costume Design, Film Editing, Makeup and Hairstyling, Original Score. There's also a strong and rich sound scope that is present. The sounds of nature as the slaves walk or as Solomon approaches his master's house is noticed. The big question is, can it win? I haven't seen everything yet so I cannot yet if it deserves it or not. I can say, if critics and audiences can get off this "difficult" watch nonsense and accept the cinematic endeavor as a look into our own history as told from a great auteur, there's no reason it can't top the night. I'm very aware that seeing this film along with Steve McQueen crowned by Oscar is nearly erasing 85 years of history in the Academy. Are they willing and ready to begin looking into new realms and allowing someone not necessarily in their inner circles to make a bold statement as McQueen and Ridley take in "12 Years a Slave?" I remain hopeful.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":664413,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2013-11-08","keywords":"slavery,separation from family,torture,kidnapping,racism","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi302032921","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MjI1OTI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMwODQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4MjI1OTI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDMwODQ3MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the antebellum United States, Solomon Northup, a free black man from upstate New York, is abducted and sold into slavery."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0252230/","name":"Chiwetel Ejiofor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0931324/","name":"Michael Kenneth Williams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2588606/","name":"Steve McQueen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0120121/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136967/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0725983/","name":"John Ridley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1185849/","name":"Solomon Northup"}],"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"Capote" is entrancing, dark, depressing, and quite satisfying. It benefits from Hoffman's perfect performance. He embodies the physical and psychological make up of a man who was the toast of the nation before and after the publication of its classic novel, "In Cold Blood". As a human being, he appeared to be an intelligent, fascinating, and manipulative creature. He could have gotten away with almost anything. Then he found the two criminals behind one of the most heinous crimes of the century and might have gotten to the realization he could also be trapped by their own dark existences.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain what happened to Capote after he developed a relationship with Smith. He grows attracted to the actions and revelations behind this killer, and we never really know what is exactly going on. There are displays of guilt and detachment at different parts in the film. What we do see is that something really affected the man, and it changed his life for good.\n\nThe film moves slowly but never loses its audience. Along with Hoffman, a remarkable supporting cast keeps us interests going, and enough is presented to make us want to know more. That will probably be the film's only flaw.

"Capote" is entrancing, dark, depressing, and quite satisfying. It benefits from Hoffman's perfect performance. He embodies the physical and psychological make up of a man who was the toast of the nation before and after the publication of its classic novel, "In Cold Blood". As a human being, he appeared to be an intelligent, fascinating, and manipulative creature. He could have gotten away with almost anything. Then he found the two criminals behind one of the most heinous crimes of the century and might have gotten to the realization he could also be trapped by their own dark existences.\n\nIt is difficult to ascertain what happened to Capote after he developed a relationship with Smith. He grows attracted to the actions and revelations behind this killer, and we never really know what is exactly going on. There are displays of guilt and detachment at different parts in the film. What we do see is that something really affected the man, and it changed his life for good.\n\nThe film moves slowly but never loses its audience. Along with Hoffman, a remarkable supporting cast keeps us interests going, and enough is presented to make us want to know more. That will probably be the film's only flaw. It fails to deliver everything it promises. It is a big satisfying tease, but after all, we are left with an endless number of questions. Keener is wonderful as Capote's supporting friend, and in his lover's role, Bruce Greenwood intrigues us as well, with the dubious character that never gives enough information to explain his attraction to a total opposite.\n\n"Capote" is a really good film and should be admire for it achieves.

Westerns seemed to have fallen off the wagon in Hollywood these past few decades, but the Coen brothers have truly worked their magic, once again, to resuscitate this genre. In this beautifully constructed Western remake of Henry Hathaway's 1969 version, 14-year-old girl Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) sets out with an eye-for-an-eye attitude to capture Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), the man who has mercilessly killed her father. In order for justice to be served she teams up with Reuben J. "Rooster" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a man of "true grit" and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon). True Grit is simple, straightforward (not words one would typically use to describe a Coen Brothers film), but as usual, it's an f-ing masterpiece. What struck me the most about this film was its skillfully crafted ambiance. Everything presented from the costumes to the settings to the dialogue— I felt completely immersed in the narrative. Thanks to cinematographer Roger Deakins for that visual thrill-ride! It's pretty apparent that Jeff Bridges had some major shoes to fill in his role originally played by John Wayne. It's safe to say it was a job well done. His style was completely powerful in this unforgettable performance. Every step he takes or word he speaks is done with thought. If there was an Oscar for 'baddest ass' Jeff Bridges would clearly hold the title, hands down. I was also quite impressed with Hailee Steinfeld's performance. As a newcomer to the Hollywood scene, she makes it pretty clear she means business. Even next to Damon, Bridges, and Brolin, she holds an extremely professional and talented composure. This is most definitely not the last time we will see her on the silver screen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":323175,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"2011-02-23","keywords":"revisionist western,reference to new mexico,death by hanging,long drop hanging,spanking threat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Grit: "Click" TV Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1984862489","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDM1NTAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI1NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDM1NTAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI1NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"True Grit: "Click" TV Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000313/","name":"Jeff Bridges"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2794962/","name":"Hailee Steinfeld"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0692427/","name":"Charles Portis"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It got boring during the middle seasons, but season 6 was very good. I have mixed emotions about season 7. They provided a lot of interesting back story for a few characters, but they left a lot of loose threads at the end.\n\nThe whole series showed way too much of Ray's daughter. She got somewhat interesting in Season 6, but then I, once again, lost interest in her during season 7.\n\nI'm glad Ray's son wasn't shown much during the last few seasons. He was an annoying character from the beginning.\n\nOverall, it's a good show if you can stick with the boring bits.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-06-18","keywords":"female investigator,nudity,fixer,fbi agent,brother sister relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000630/","name":"Liev Schreiber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0550371/","name":"Eddie Marsan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005231/","name":"Dash Mihok"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093837/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0081189/","name":"Ann Biderman"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 7 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2778578713","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVhY2M3OGYtYjRjOS00MmFjLWFlNTItOWFlOThlMmZjOTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVhY2M3OGYtYjRjOS00MmFjLWFlNTItOWFlOThlMmZjOTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"While Ray makes personal progress, there are dangers that require the Ray Donovan of old.

The pace, direction and writing has been excellent. I have watched and re-watched every episode over the past 3 seasons and really can't understand why they would cancel this show for the ages. First I was not a person that watched West Wing. I was younger and dumber for the show to stick. this show grabbed me from the get go and I have never been more surprised with it's greatness.\n\nHBO - why oh why are buying into the big network belief that the public is not getting what you bring us. This show is why I subscribe to your network and seeing it leave is a shame. The past episode "Oh Shenandoah" was brilliant is so many ways. It left me thinking about my father and how we can challenge ourselves in moments of being tested. I came here to tell everyone I will watch the last episode with sadness and wish I could continue this great program going forward, but it's over. I will save these three seasons and remember every episode with fondness and hope to see these great actors, directors and writers in the future where they can continue to express themselves without worrying about ratings or money driven desires.\n\nThank you for 3 great seasons!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":108689,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-06-24","keywords":"newsroom,ethics,television producer,news reporting,tv news","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001099/","name":"Jeff Daniels","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0607865/","name":"Emily Mortimer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0302330/","name":"John Gallagher Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0284741/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3499276825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjVjNmNhNTEtYWQyZi00OTljLWI1YjUtMGMyNGFlOWM4NDg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjVjNmNhNTEtYWQyZi00OTljLWI1YjUtMGMyNGFlOWM4NDg2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. \n\nSandra Oh stands out for her comic timing, but the entire cast is superb. It's not as grave as ER, but is just as compelling. Also, it's a little more accessible than ER and some of the more serious medical dramas. The show is definitely worth catching--if you can't watch it when it airs, TiVo it or rent the first season DVD. It's well worth the time spent! It's great for marathon viewings!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":270305,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It got boring during the middle seasons, but season 6 was very good. I have mixed emotions about season 7. They provided a lot of interesting back story for a few characters, but they left a lot of loose threads at the end.\n\nThe whole series showed way too much of Ray's daughter. She got somewhat interesting in Season 6, but then I, once again, lost interest in her during season 7.\n\nI'm glad Ray's son wasn't shown much during the last few seasons. He was an annoying character from the beginning.\n\nOverall, it's a good show if you can stick with the boring bits.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80309,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-06-18","keywords":"female investigator,nudity,fixer,fbi agent,brother sister relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000630/","name":"Liev Schreiber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0550371/","name":"Eddie Marsan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005231/","name":"Dash Mihok"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093837/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0081189/","name":"Ann Biderman"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 7 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2778578713","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVhY2M3OGYtYjRjOS00MmFjLWFlNTItOWFlOThlMmZjOTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVhY2M3OGYtYjRjOS00MmFjLWFlNTItOWFlOThlMmZjOTRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"While Ray makes personal progress, there are dangers that require the Ray Donovan of old.

Although there has only been one season up to now this by far exceeds The Sopranos, The Wire and dare I say it Breaking Bad. Many a TV series starts off too slow – well this is not one of them. We get action from the get go and this only increases up until the end – where we get a magnificent finish. The storyline is great and the acting is superb. We really get to see the characters develop and the transformation of Genny is brilliantly displayed.

We have seen an influx of Alien takeovers recently and it is getting a bit stale I must admit. Don't get me wrong, I love films about ET's taking over, but Hollywood has beaten that horse to death. "Rise of the Planet of the Apes" is a welcome change to this trend pitting us measly humans against our closest ancestors, Great Apes. Directed by Rupert Wyatt ("The Escapist") and supported by the unbelievable WETA Digital ("King Kong", "Lord of the Rings", "Avatar") for special effects. "Apes" is a wonder of motion capture, an intelligent heart felt script with great direction. Unfortunately, the human actors left a lot to be desired. But this film isn't about the humans, it's all about the Simians.\n\nAs plots go, this is pretty basic. James Franco plays Will Rodman, a brilliant scientist with a breakthrough drug that just may cure Alzheimer's. Rodman and his team are using chimpanzee's to test this new drug and in the process find out that it increases intelligence as well as repair cells in the brain. One of the test subjects gets loose in an intense sequence and ultimately put down. It turns out that she had just given birth to a beautiful baby chimp who inherited this new "altered" gene. Rodman decides the only moral thing to do is to take the baby home while a co-worker tries to find a sanctuary but once Rodman finds out that this little ball of fur has the intelligence of a human child twice it's age he decides to keep and raise the chimp as a child. It's only a matter of time that our chimp Caesar figures out he is not like the other children in the neighborhood. Rodman is forced to give up Caesar to an "Ape Sanctuary" and there begins some of the most exhilarating revolutionary action I've ever seen.\n\nTechnically, this film is massive. The work WETA Digital did with motion capture (mo-cap) is truly a wonder to behold. Visual Effects Supervisor with WETA Digital Joe Letteri stated that they built on the technology used in "Avatar" to produce the most realistic and accurate portrayal of the actors suited to play the Simians. Andy Serkis (Gollum from "Lord of the Rings" and Kong from "King Kong") plays chimp Caesar. Serkis manages to fool all of us into believing he is a real animal with super intelligence. His facial emotions and mannerisms should most certainly nominate him for an Oscar. There is a real connection that the audience feels with Caesar and it is all thanks to Serkis' work. Without such an experienced mo-cap actor, this film would not have been such a success.\n\nNot only is the technology used to create the revolution amazing, the action is top notch as well. Many times I found myself with my jaw on the floor from the intense sequences put to screen. Everything from a simple terrifying look from an angry ape to the full out battle on the Golden Gate Bridge was pulled off without a hitch. Many points to the pacing of the films action as it could have been the crutch that killed this beast of a film. One of the most amazing scenes in my opinion is when a group of apes are fleeing over top a suburban neighborhood through the trees. While this is going on we see some people on the street while leaves upon leaves are falling to the ground. This level of detail is apparent in every shot, brilliant work by the production team.\n\nMy only problems with this film is the acting from Franco and Freida Pinto, who plays the love interest. They both seemed to "phone it in" as it were. They were not overly impressive and just seemed stale. Maybe the director wanted them to tone it down so that Serkis would have more of an impact acting as a voiceless chimp. Either way, as I said in the beginning, this film wasn't about the humans. It's about compassion, freedom and understanding and on those levels the film is a grand success.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":508228,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-08-05","keywords":"ape,chimpanzee,planet of the apes,alzheimer's disease,when animals attack","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1615502617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Trailer #2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012501/","name":"Rupert Wyatt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415425/","name":"Rick Jaffa"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798646/","name":"Amanda Silver"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0099541/","name":"Pierre Boulle"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

They both seemed to "phone it in" as it were. They were not overly impressive and just seemed stale. Maybe the director wanted them to tone it down so that Serkis would have more of an impact acting as a voiceless chimp. Either way, as I said in the beginning, this film wasn't about the humans. It's about compassion, freedom and understanding and on those levels the film is a grand success.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":508228,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-08-05","keywords":"ape,chimpanzee,planet of the apes,alzheimer's disease,when animals attack","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1615502617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Trailer #2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012501/","name":"Rupert Wyatt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415425/","name":"Rick Jaffa","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798646/","name":"Amanda Silver","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0099541/","name":"Pierre Boulle"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Haven't quite worked out what it's satirising, but I'm pretty hungover today so trying not to think too hard...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-03-13","keywords":"hunting humans,gun,satire,human hunted down for sport,reference to animal farm the novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi189054745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUzODFkYmUtMjNkYi00MzEzLTgwMzUtNGY3NTg3M2E1ZmIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUzODFkYmUtMjNkYi00MzEzLTgwMzUtNGY3NTg3M2E1ZmIxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"The most talked about movie of the year is the one nobody has seen … yet.\r\n \r\nTwelve strangers wake up in a clearing.

Xavier is a shining example and his journey throughout the film matches that of Erik.\n\nFirst Class never undermines the audience nor talks down to them and does all that is expected of it. It delivers great action, humor, effects and a strong connection between heroes, villains and those developing in between. The retro design is suave and making this a period piece gives it a cool and unique flavor. The collaboration between Singer and Vaughn apparently was a perfect blend. Vaughn did a brilliant job and Singer's vision from the first two films stayed in tact and was enhanced. I have to add that the score had a perfect heroic theme but was also moving and very well done. The overall impact of this film leaves you with a great sensation of a job well done. Fast paced yet filled with depth, spellbinding visual effects and a gripping finale. In the end, they succeeded in re-establishing these characters in a superb and interesting manner.

Off the bat I have to say that this "Final Cut" version of the film is the only one I have seen.

Consequently as a massive fan of historical epics through the years, it has been a constant nagging itch for me to see Alexander in its entirety. So with Oliver Stone tinkering away with versions - convinced he has made a worthwhile epic - I finally delved in.\n\nThe Final Cut, as far as I'm aware, is a vast improvement on that savagely received theatrical release, well that is said by those who tried again instead of calling quits at the first production. Straight away I could see the difference, where once was a plodding first hour, now sits a vibrancy, with Stone seemingly saying that he can do great action and drama, just please hang around during all the historical chatter, sexual connotation, family strife and conquering machinations, and I will enthral you as a whole.\n\nBy his own admission, Stone reveals he took on a most complex historical character and in his eyes has made a film to befit such complexity. We get a splintered narrative, as we kick off with the crux of Alexander the Great, the leader, while Alexander's childhood and family forming is interspersed at various junctures. The battles are high in intensity and blood letting - exhilarating at times - but more crucially they let us engage with the tactical "ahead of their time" manoeuvres of Alexander the Great. This version mostly flows alright, and I got to feel how Alexander's mind was working in the process, even if come pics closure I didn't fully know the man.\n\nEpically cast of course, some of them work, others not so much. Farrell's looked odd, in the way that Pitt's was in Troy (released this same year as Alexander), but apart from the accent issue he grows into the role and is fiercely committed. Jolie is just wrong for the role of domineering Olympias, worse still the scenes she does with Farrell are damp and threaten to derail the drama already built up. This latter point is more annoying given a great thread involving Dawson as Alexander's wife Roxanne is built up superbly, only to not be pulled until some drama very late in the play. The rest of the cast come through as ok for period flavours (expected for Hopkins, Plummer and Meyers, interesting as regards Leto).\n\nThis is not the life ambition masterpiece Stone wanted to make, even if he proclaims on the extras that he's happy and content with The Final Cut version. This cut still shows some cracks, but these are not seismic enough to hurt the film. For there's a lot of grandeur, blood stirring and thought gone into the production, and there's a lot to be said for that in this day and age of soulless cash making filmic exercises.

He has created some of the most fascinating creatures that traditional Hollywood doesn't have the guts or inclination to ever assemble. I would take Guillmero Del Torro in the director's chair any time any place, but Hellboy II shows that he is not without his flaws. Ron Perlman who is terrific as Hellboy doesn't have anything truly interesting to say or do, the world around him is magical but the plot isn't.\n\nHellboy is the most unique character to appear in your comic book shop. The mythology and the character are such the opposite of the main stream and to Hellboy II's credit so is this movie. Ron Perlman doesn't deliver catch phrases or gun down bad guys for the sake of doing so. He is an interesting character but he is overshadowed by this lackluster plot and the world around it. I felt as if we didn't see enough of Big Red or maybe we did we just didn't get to see the most of the talents. Del Torro constantly wants to remind you that he directed Pan's Labyrinth because visually the creatures look like they were leftovers from that film. I don't mind this per say but these characters just don't have much to do, they are there really to look at rather than them having significance. Visually I can't complain about them because they are amazing but they serve little purpose to the story.\n\nThe plot is really the weakest thing this movie has going for it. I felt it took too many liberties against the original concepts of Hellboy. Hellboy is a creature alive in our world, Del Torro tries to tell us that our world is nothing more than a division of fantasy and reality. Well we spend too much time in the fantasy that we forget the fact that this Golden Army is a threat to reality. The villain Prince Nuada is weak, we don't see any method to his madness other than the fact that the plot dictates that he be the antagonist. In the first film and to a lesser degree this one we were given details about why Hellboy has faith in humanity and would chose not to serve his purpose. It's interesting because we are given glimpses of what could have been something that could have added real teeth and tension to the story, for the first time Hellboy is tempted by evil, weakly tempted but tempted nonetheless. This mental struggle could have given our actors the chance to show their talent but instead the filler between the action scenes is just okay at best.\n\nI didn't hate Hellboy II I just think it needed some beef in it's story. Del Torro has shown us he is a master storyteller but this time he didn't focus on the story it's self. I would recommend this film but I know Del Torro can and has done much better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262248,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-10-08","keywords":"superhero,twins,friendship,cat,elf","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. teaser trailer: Hellboy II: The Golden Army","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1588723993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg","description":"This is a teaser trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, directed by Guillermo del Toro"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004757/","name":"Selma Blair"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427964/","name":"Doug Jones"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020061/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239918/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586005/","name":"Mike Mignola"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I would have liked to see more interaction between Peter Pan and Captain Hook, and also more screen time for the Captain Hook character generally.\n\nAlso, Neverland is supposed to have pirates and Indians in it, and there WERE a LOT of pirates. But I never once saw an Indian.\n\nMaggie Smith was a fine actress and it is always great to see her on screen.\n\nI thought that the end of the film, with the old man flying out of the house, was kind of nutty and really unnecessary, a la the all-too literal ending of "Cocoon", in which the senior citizens are shown flying away in an alien spaceship.\n\nMy problems with this movie, though, are minor, and I generally consider this a very good fantasy film for kids and adults--at least those of us who never quite grew up--alike.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":242629,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"1991-12-11","keywords":"children,1990s,caught in a net,hero,duel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hook","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi845128729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2M1Mjc1MDMtODJiMS00NGMwLTk3NGQtZTY0YmQxN2Y4NWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2M1Mjc1MDMtODJiMS00NGMwLTk3NGQtZTY0YmQxN2Y4NWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Hook","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000163/","name":"Dustin Hoffman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057381/","name":"J.M.

After this happens Michael who lives in the Bahamas with his wife and daughter studying sea snails, visits his mother and asks her to come down there with him and the family. Ellen wants Michael to not go near the water, but he convinces her that it's all fine, since great whites don't like the warm water.

The last sequel "Jaws 3" was a bad film, but I actually enjoyed it to some degree, but here the personal agenda format was just rubbish and the special connection between the Brody's and the shark was just plain risible. I just found this clunker quite lacklustre with it's melodramatic, soap opera of a story and it's lack of thrills and suspense. It was quite a drag and it did have that cheap TV feel about it, despite it's more than capable cast. The only thing that I thought was decent was the terrifyingly, bloody and macabre opening death. Although, few of the performances ( mainly Lance Guest in the key role of Michael Brody and Michael Caine's happy- go-lucky pilot character Hoagie ) made sure that the film didn't sink too fast. While, the rest were simply one-note and Mario Van Peebles' Jamaican accent was just so dodgy. But what was in need of a life-jacket was the dire script that threw out many awful lines of dialogues. "I've always wanted to make love to an angry welder. I've dreamed of nothing else since I was a small boy." What?! The repetitively, diluted story is full of crock with many implausible situations and it doesn't leave too much up to the imagination. Was the writer and the director drinking sea water on this project? Maybe so, because Michael's wife's supposed piece of art resembled  what? I just don't see it. Well, the sprawling beach lines and crystal blue waters were a nice sight. Too bad that the mechanical, but crooked plastic shark slowly got in the way. The ramshackle design looked dreadful, but the makers didn't seem to notice because they constantly kept showing the abomination in it's full glory. I even got the feeling that the shark just couldn't stop grinning. The (few) shark attacks are rather furious and quite graphic, but I found the latter ones to be laughable because of the execution. Really, it goes all out to outdo itself, but this puddle turns out to be simply inept in mostly every single department. Overall, a fatally disastrous novel production that never should have seen open waters and you won't be laughing too much, but you'll be a daze of bemusement to how this franchise fell apart.\n\nIt's definitely as bad as its reputation.

DER LETZTE BULLE is truly excellent and can easily compare to international productions. It gives you just the right combination of splendid humur, entertaining story lines, and a strong human factor.

Even though death is imminent for each of us, we don't all get the opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones. For those who do, it may not go as smoothly as they'd imagined. This is especially true if they are choosing to end things on their own terms due to a terminal illness. Roger Michell (NOTTING HILL, 1999; VENUS, 2006) directs this remake of the 2014 Danish film SILENT HEART (directed by Bille August), both written by Christian Torpe.\n\nFamily matriarch Lily (Oscar winner Susan Sarandon) has a terminal illness, and has arranged for the family to return home for one final get-together. See, Lily, with the assistance of her doting doctor husband Paul (Sam Neill) is planning to 'go' on her own terms, while it's still physically possible for her to take the medicinal potion. "Death with dignity", or euthanasia, is becoming a more frequent topic in films and conversation, despite still being illegal in most states. Of course, the legal and moral questions are heavily debated, but when it's a family member, it's the emotions that heat up.\n\nFirst to arrive is eldest daughter Jennifer (Oscar winner Kate Winslet) and her husband Michael (Rainn Wilson, "The Office") and their son Jonathan (Anson Boon, CRAWL). Kate is the uptight, demanding type who is always judging others - including her nerdy well-meaning husband, and her free-spirited son. The younger daughter Anna (Mia Wasikowska) arrives with her partner Chris (Bex Taylor-Klaus, "The Killing"), and it's immediately clear that Jennifer and Anna are personality opposites (with some baggage), and that Anna is carrying an unspoken burden. Last to arrive is long-time family friend Liz (Lindsay Duncan), who is so close to Lily and Paul, that the family photographs show her on many family vacations and events over the years.\n\nThis has the look and feel of a stage presentation, as most of the scenes are filled with dialogue and occur within the confines of the stunning east coast home, apparently designed by Lily. There is a family walk along the beach and dunes, but most of the run time is filled with interpersonal interactions - some pleasant, some not pleasant at all. In fact, an early (by a couple of months) Christmas family dinner is sprinkled with pot smoking and emotional outbursts. It turns out, not surprisingly, that some of the secrets previously kept, find their way out into the open causing a few bumps in Lily's farewell weekend.\n\nThe complexities of family dynamics are amplified in this situation. Who is ready and who isn't, and why, becomes a topic of multiple discussions. We never really learn the meaning of the film's title, but we do enjoy the work of so many fine actors. You might recall Susan Sarandon played a dying woman more than 20 years ago in STEPMOM (1998), and this movie blends two memorable and recent films: FRANKIE with Isabelle Huppert, and HERE AWHILE with Anna Camp. Saying goodbye is never easy, but it sure beats missing the chance.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3640,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-18","keywords":"euthanasia,family gathering,terminal illness,assisted suicide,remake","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi912113177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWI3MGQyYTEtOTI2MS00MTg5LTk0MTItMDlkMjMyOGYzMDZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWI3MGQyYTEtOTI2MS00MTg5LTk0MTItMDlkMjMyOGYzMDZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Lily (Susan Sarandon) and Paul (Sam Neill) summon their loved ones to their beach house for one final gathering after Lily decides to end her long lbattle with ALS.

At best he's competent at what he does, and some years back made a halfway clever and original 'movie'-comedy (Big Fat Liar), but mostly has kept to Fox studio commercialism like Cheaper by the Dozen and the Night at the Museum movies. And yet, he (or just the studio) must have had the insight to put together two of the funniest people working right now- not to mention with shows back-to-back on Thursday nights on NBC- Steve Carrel and Tina Fey, because they help elevate anyone's work by a longshot. This isn't to say that Josh Klausner's script may not have some laughs, but where exactly I can't be sure, since most of his contributions would appear to come from the super-conventional story aspects (as my own mother put it, "I don't know, looks like The Out of Towners, or that Blind Date movie from the 80's").\n\nSo yeah, basic premise, married couple looking for a little change (their friends are splitting up), go out to 'The City' (NYC of course) and to a very nice restaurant. In a move that could come out of a Seinfeld episode, they can't get a reservation so Carrel overhears a waitress calling for someone else for a reservation and he decides they should take it since they're no-shows. The "Tripplehorns", as it turns out, have some shady dealings with some bad dues with guns, and so the Fosters, our confused heroes, go on the run in the city. Whenever the movie focuses on the core plot of all of this, it's by the numbers stuff, save for a climax that ratchets up the absurdity of everyone involved (including good actors playing decent-to-mediocre baddies like William Fichtner and Ray Liotta).\n\nIt's when Fey and Carrel are allowed to play loose with the script that it strikes the iron. Their timing is impeccable, and they have chemistry together, which is crucial. And when they come across some other supporting characters, like Mark Wahlberg's (VERY) shirtless ex-military guy with all of his high-tech equipment, or the "real" Tripplehorns played by James Franco and Mila Kunis, there's further hilarity that ensues from the interactions and precise timing. That's all you need sometimes in a comedy that's based in formula, is two character to at least semi care about (and, perhaps more wisely than a Hollywood rom-com can be given credit for, it has painfully normal characters here, nothing too complicated), and who are funny in semi-funny situations. Even a ridiculous car chase where the Fosters hit a cab and the two are connected bumper to bumper through the streets is funny just because of the acting. Given the right mood and timing they could read a census report and get a few chuckles from the pauses and inflections.\n\nSo, if you're looking for something masterfully done, look elsewhere. If you just want to see two stars who are funny be funny almost despite some of the limitations in the script, Date Night deserves a chance. At the least you get to see the two show off their "skills" in a strip-club scene, and, did I mention Mark Whalberg doesn't have on a shirt?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156642,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-04-09","keywords":"downtown,desire,thug,criminal,kingpin","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Date Night: International Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2353399065","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyMDQ0ODcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyMDQ0ODcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City, a case of mistaken identity turns a bored married couple's attempt at a glamorous and romantic evening into something more thrilling and dangerous."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275486/","name":"Tina Fey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158853/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458441/","name":"Josh Klausner"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This isn't to say that Josh Klausner's script may not have some laughs, but where exactly I can't be sure, since most of his contributions would appear to come from the super-conventional story aspects (as my own mother put it, "I don't know, looks like The Out of Towners, or that Blind Date movie from the 80's").\n\nSo yeah, basic premise, married couple looking for a little change (their friends are splitting up), go out to 'The City' (NYC of course) and to a very nice restaurant. In a move that could come out of a Seinfeld episode, they can't get a reservation so Carrel overhears a waitress calling for someone else for a reservation and he decides they should take it since they're no-shows. The "Tripplehorns", as it turns out, have some shady dealings with some bad dues with guns, and so the Fosters, our confused heroes, go on the run in the city. Whenever the movie focuses on the core plot of all of this, it's by the numbers stuff, save for a climax that ratchets up the absurdity of everyone involved (including good actors playing decent-to-mediocre baddies like William Fichtner and Ray Liotta).\n\nIt's when Fey and Carrel are allowed to play loose with the script that it strikes the iron. Their timing is impeccable, and they have chemistry together, which is crucial. And when they come across some other supporting characters, like Mark Wahlberg's (VERY) shirtless ex-military guy with all of his high-tech equipment, or the "real" Tripplehorns played by James Franco and Mila Kunis, there's further hilarity that ensues from the interactions and precise timing. That's all you need sometimes in a comedy that's based in formula, is two character to at least semi care about (and, perhaps more wisely than a Hollywood rom-com can be given credit for, it has painfully normal characters here, nothing too complicated), and who are funny in semi-funny situations. Even a ridiculous car chase where the Fosters hit a cab and the two are connected bumper to bumper through the streets is funny just because of the acting. Given the right mood and timing they could read a census report and get a few chuckles from the pauses and inflections.\n\nSo, if you're looking for something masterfully done, look elsewhere. If you just want to see two stars who are funny be funny almost despite some of the limitations in the script, Date Night deserves a chance. At the least you get to see the two show off their "skills" in a strip-club scene, and, did I mention Mark Whalberg doesn't have on a shirt?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156642,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-04-09","keywords":"downtown,desire,thug,criminal,kingpin","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Date Night: International Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2353399065","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyMDQ0ODcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyMDQ0ODcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City, a case of mistaken identity turns a bored married couple's attempt at a glamorous and romantic evening into something more thrilling and dangerous.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275486/","name":"Tina Fey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158853/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458441/","name":"Josh Klausner"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

While it doesn't always look natural, Buck's CGI model is so expressive and can cause the viewer to experience a variety of different emotions, despite not even being there. Harrison Ford also does well as the elderly, depressed John Thornton, carrying a great deal of tragedy and mystery about his past throughout the movie. The movie also features stunning cinematography, with several beautiful shots and camera angles. It's a true joy to look at. However, there are a few problems with the movie. For starters, John Thornton narrates a lot throughout the movie, despite not being present for, and therefore having no way of knowing about, the events that he's describing. Another issue is Dan Stevens' character; Hal. Hal is an entirely unnecessary, one dimensional antagonist, who just doesn't work with the story this movie is trying to tell. His presence also completely derails John Thornton's resolution. However, despite these problems, I still recommend The Call Of The Wild.

A remake of the 2014 Danish film 'Silent Heart'.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt8717446/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"ferguson-6"},"dateCreated":"2020-09-17","inLanguage":"English","name":"saying goodbye","reviewBody":"Greetings again from the darkness. Even though death is imminent for each of us, we don't all get the opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones. For those who do, it may not go as smoothly as they'd imagined. This is especially true if they are choosing to end things on their own terms due to a terminal illness. Roger Michell (NOTTING HILL, 1999; VENUS, 2006) directs this remake of the 2014 Danish film SILENT HEART (directed by Bille August), both written by Christian Torpe.\n\nFamily matriarch Lily (Oscar winner Susan Sarandon) has a terminal illness, and has arranged for the family to return home for one final get-together. See, Lily, with the assistance of her doting doctor husband Paul (Sam Neill) is planning to 'go' on her own terms, while it's still physically possible for her to take the medicinal potion. "Death with dignity", or euthanasia, is becoming a more frequent topic in films and conversation, despite still being illegal in most states. Of course, the legal and moral questions are heavily debated, but when it's a family member, it's the emotions that heat up.\n\nFirst to arrive is eldest daughter Jennifer (Oscar winner Kate Winslet) and her husband Michael (Rainn Wilson, "The Office") and their son Jonathan (Anson Boon, CRAWL). Kate is the uptight, demanding type who is always judging others - including her nerdy well-meaning husband, and her free-spirited son. The younger daughter Anna (Mia Wasikowska) arrives with her partner Chris (Bex Taylor-Klaus, "The Killing"), and it's immediately clear that Jennifer and Anna are personality opposites (with some baggage), and that Anna is carrying an unspoken burden. Last to arrive is long-time family friend Liz (Lindsay Duncan), who is so close to Lily and Paul, that the family photographs show her on many family vacations and events over the years.\n\nThis has the look and feel of a stage presentation, as most of the scenes are filled with dialogue and occur within the confines of the stunning east coast home, apparently designed by Lily. There is a family walk along the beach and dunes, but most of the run time is filled with interpersonal interactions - some pleasant, some not pleasant at all.

A remake of the 2014 Danish film 'Silent Heart'.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt8717446/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"ferguson-6","dateCreated":"2020-09-17","inLanguage":"English","name":"saying goodbye","reviewBody":"Greetings again from the darkness. Even though death is imminent for each of us, we don't all get the opportunity to say goodbye to loved ones. For those who do, it may not go as smoothly as they'd imagined. This is especially true if they are choosing to end things on their own terms due to a terminal illness. Roger Michell (NOTTING HILL, 1999; VENUS, 2006) directs this remake of the 2014 Danish film SILENT HEART (directed by Bille August), both written by Christian Torpe.\n\nFamily matriarch Lily (Oscar winner Susan Sarandon) has a terminal illness, and has arranged for the family to return home for one final get-together. See, Lily, with the assistance of her doting doctor husband Paul (Sam Neill) is planning to 'go' on her own terms, while it's still physically possible for her to take the medicinal potion. "Death with dignity", or euthanasia, is becoming a more frequent topic in films and conversation, despite still being illegal in most states. Of course, the legal and moral questions are heavily debated, but when it's a family member, it's the emotions that heat up.\n\nFirst to arrive is eldest daughter Jennifer (Oscar winner Kate Winslet) and her husband Michael (Rainn Wilson, "The Office") and their son Jonathan (Anson Boon, CRAWL). Kate is the uptight, demanding type who is always judging others - including her nerdy well-meaning husband, and her free-spirited son. The younger daughter Anna (Mia Wasikowska) arrives with her partner Chris (Bex Taylor-Klaus, "The Killing"), and it's immediately clear that Jennifer and Anna are personality opposites (with some baggage), and that Anna is carrying an unspoken burden. Last to arrive is long-time family friend Liz (Lindsay Duncan), who is so close to Lily and Paul, that the family photographs show her on many family vacations and events over the years.\n\nThis has the look and feel of a stage presentation, as most of the scenes are filled with dialogue and occur within the confines of the stunning east coast home, apparently designed by Lily. There is a family walk along the beach and dunes, but most of the run time is filled with interpersonal interactions - some pleasant, some not pleasant at all. In fact, an early (by a couple of months) Christmas family dinner is sprinkled with pot smoking and emotional outbursts. It turns out, not surprisingly, that some of the secrets previously kept, find their way out into the open causing a few bumps in Lily's farewell weekend.\n\nThe complexities of family dynamics are amplified in this situation. Who is ready and who isn't, and why, becomes a topic of multiple discussions. We never really learn the meaning of the film's title, but we do enjoy the work of so many fine actors. You might recall Susan Sarandon played a dying woman more than 20 years ago in STEPMOM (1998), and this movie blends two memorable and recent films: FRANKIE with Isabelle Huppert, and HERE AWHILE with Anna Camp.

There is no more magic in this movie than in any of the Indiana Jones movies, or Star Wars films, where the ability to rip out a beating human heart, magic stones that ensure prosperity, the Arc Of The Covenant as a force that can destroy armies, a mystical chalice which will impart immortality to those who drink from it, or The Force which enables levitation of large spacecraft and the manipulation of minds... all these are accepted by most filmgoers without demur.

It's whether the emotional truth of the film, often melodramatically worn on the director's sleeve, can grab your own heart and allow you to wallow in it unashamadely.\n\nOther reviewers have said here that they were able to watch the whole film with rapt attention from beginning to end. I join those ranks, and proudly. There is hardly a moment when the action - emotional or actual - is not hitting you right between the eyes, be it the stunning vistas or the awful badness of the baddies, the tender first kiss between the Drover and Lady Sarah, or the razor's edge existence of the young "creamie" boy, Nullah, always on the run from the well-meaning but misguided authorities who would "breed the Aboriginal out of him".\n\nSure, there are some CGI sections that at first seem way over the top, even comic book-like in their execution. But I'm not sure these weren't intentional. I wonder whether they were deliberately done they way they were to reinforce the magical and mystical thrust of the story? Yes, in Australia there are elements and style quotations from scores of previous movies. It pays homage to Indiana Jones (all four of them), Out Of Africa, Star Wars, any of the great westerns, The African Queen, Pearl Harbour (yes, Darwin really was bombed by the Japanese just after Pearl Harbour, with great loss of life), even The Wizard Of Oz. The latter was used as a metaphor for the boy's journey from grim reality to a mystical land full of evil characters, good fairies and magic animals. When he finally gets to see the movie itself, I'll guarantee even the most hardened eye in the audience will be struggling to hold back a tear.\n\nThe music was an eclectic collage of emotional cues, from the original score, thru the Hollywood musical and on to Elgar's Variations, with jazz, swing and bobbysoxer dance themes in between. Why not? The visuals and the sound reinforced each other, reaching not for footnotable, citable truth but for emotional truth (which is what all good films have ever done).\n\nThis was a great film, completely contrary to my preconceived notions of what it would be like to watch.

While it doesn't always look natural, Buck's CGI model is so expressive and can cause the viewer to experience a variety of different emotions, despite not even being there. Harrison Ford also does well as the elderly, depressed John Thornton, carrying a great deal of tragedy and mystery about his past throughout the movie. The movie also features stunning cinematography, with several beautiful shots and camera angles. It's a true joy to look at. However, there are a few problems with the movie. For starters, John Thornton narrates a lot throughout the movie, despite not being present for, and therefore having no way of knowing about, the events that he's describing. Another issue is Dan Stevens' character; Hal. Hal is an entirely unnecessary, one dimensional antagonist, who just doesn't work with the story this movie is trying to tell.

After this happens Michael who lives in the Bahamas with his wife and daughter studying sea snails, visits his mother and asks her to come down there with him and the family.

The last sequel "Jaws 3" was a bad film, but I actually enjoyed it to some degree, but here the personal agenda format was just rubbish and the special connection between the Brody's and the shark was just plain risible. I just found this clunker quite lacklustre with it's melodramatic, soap opera of a story and it's lack of thrills and suspense. It was quite a drag and it did have that cheap TV feel about it, despite it's more than capable cast. The only thing that I thought was decent was the terrifyingly, bloody and macabre opening death. Although, few of the performances ( mainly Lance Guest in the key role of Michael Brody and Michael Caine's happy- go-lucky pilot character Hoagie ) made sure that the film didn't sink too fast.

The repetitively, diluted story is full of crock with many implausible situations and it doesn't leave too much up to the imagination. Was the writer and the director drinking sea water on this project? Maybe so, because Michael's wife's supposed piece of art resembled  what? I just don't see it.

The ramshackle design looked dreadful, but the makers didn't seem to notice because they constantly kept showing the abomination in it's full glory. I even got the feeling that the shark just couldn't stop grinning. The (few) shark attacks are rather furious and quite graphic, but I found the latter ones to be laughable because of the execution. Really, it goes all out to outdo itself, but this puddle turns out to be simply inept in mostly every single department. Overall, a fatally disastrous novel production that never should have seen open waters and you won't be laughing too much, but you'll be a daze of bemusement to how this franchise fell apart.\n\nIt's definitely as bad as its reputation.

    <desc lang="de">Wie bereits in den vorangegangenen "3 Engel für Charlie"-Filmen und der TV-Serie arbeiten drei Ermittlerinnen – in diesem Fall Sabina Wilson, Jane Kano und Elena Houghlin, die erst im Laufe des Films zum Team stösst – für den geheimnisvollen Charlie Townsend, dem sie selbst noch nie begegnet sind. Seine Identität ist geheim und Aufträge von Charlie werden stets per Lautsprecher entgegengenommen. Die Townsend-Agency ist mit seinen Agentinnen über die Zeit so erfolgreich geworden, dass das Unternehmen mittlerweile expandiert und mehrere Gruppen mit tapferen Engeln an verschiedenen Standorten besitzt. Angeleitet werden die Frauen von unterschiedlichen Vermittlern – den sogenannten Bosleys – die ihren Agentinnen die weltweit härtesten Jobs an Land ziehen. Sabina, Jane und Elena müssen im neuesten "Charlie's Angels"-Abenteuer ihr eigenes Leben aufs Spiel setzen, weil ein junger System-Ingenieur geheime Informationen über eine tödliche Technologie weitergibt...</desc>

    <desc lang="de">The Boxtrolls: Directed by Graham Annable, Anthony Stacchi. With Steve Blum, Dee Bradley Baker, Max Mitchell, Ben Kingsley. A young orphaned boy raised by underground cave-dwelling trash collectors tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0787474/","name":"The Boxtrolls","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODA5MDkyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMyNjkzMjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young orphaned boy raised by underground cave-dwelling trash collectors tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0787474/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"jadepietro"},"dateCreated":"2014-10-01","inLanguage":"English","name":"Thinking Outside the Box","reviewBody":"This film is recommended.\n\nThe Boxtrolls, a well-crafted stop motion animation film combined with the latest CGI advances, is an entertaining but somewhat safer and slightly sanitized film from Laika, the same studio that delivered Coraline and ParaNorman, two earlier children's film with a twisted Gothic edge. A pleasant antidote to the cheery Disney fare regularly served to the young set, the film is diverting fun. \n\nThere are still twists and turns in the film but it's less of a giddy roller coaster ride than expected. Based on Alan Snow's novel, Here Be Monsters, the darker tone of the book has been substantially altered and lightened up for a more crowd-pleasing effect, although there are some grotesque moments that may frighten the little ones.\n\nMoviegoers are immediately transported to the dingy squalor of brick factories and small shoppes that line the cobblestone streets of Dicken's Ole Victorian London town, or, in this case, renamed Cheesebridge. The upper and lower class live here, both in fear of the Boxtrolls, a lower lower subspecies that dwell underground who are part monster, part cardboard. Living amidst them is Eggs, an abandoned child who was lovingly raised by these creatures that roam the night to recycle the discarded refuse left by people. They avoid human contact as much as possible. Who can blame them! There is the haughty and aristocratic Lord and Lady Portley-Rind, their inquisitive and precocious daughter, Winnie, and especially Archibald Snatcher, a scheming and hateful villain whose main goal is to do away with all Boxtrolls! \n\nAs with most animated films nowadays, the visual elements are far superior to the narrative story. The Boxtrolls are not the exception. While the script has some clever dialog, an involving tale, and its charming characters, the plot becomes too formula-driven and conventional. The screenplay by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava relies too heavily on slapstick and chase sequences rather than developing any deep characterizations. The Boxtrolls themselves lack any real distinctive personalities and that British droll humor is in short supply. Everything seems a tad too predictable and ordinary, except for the artistry of the filmmakers and their wonderful details with the elaborate settings, steam-punk gadgetry, and off-beat characters. Special kudos to the remarkable production design by Paul Lasaine. \n\nThe voice-over work by the actors (Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Tracy Morgan) is highly accomplished and adds even more joy to the film, especially with Sir Ben Kingley's marvelous line delivery as the nasty baddie who completely steals the film. (In fact, Archibald is more interesting than our hero, Eggs, at least, as viewed in this film adaptation. Kingsley has created one of the best animated villains in years, although part of his great performance pays direct homage to Dame Edna.)\n\nDirectors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi painstakingly create a unique world of grime and clutter. They also allow the surreal elements to emerge to maximum effect, particularly in the underground sequences. Though the film lacks some cohesiveness in its story-telling, The Boxtrolls, more often than not, does think outside the box. With all its creative energy and technical inventiveness on display, even Roald Dahl would be proud.

A pleasant antidote to the cheery Disney fare regularly served to the young set, the film is diverting fun. \n\nThere are still twists and turns in the film but it's less of a giddy roller coaster ride than expected. Based on Alan Snow's novel, Here Be Monsters, the darker tone of the book has been substantially altered and lightened up for a more crowd-pleasing effect, although there are some grotesque moments that may frighten the little ones.\n\nMoviegoers are immediately transported to the dingy squalor of brick factories and small shoppes that line the cobblestone streets of Dicken's Ole Victorian London town, or, in this case, renamed Cheesebridge. The upper and lower class live here, both in fear of the Boxtrolls, a lower lower subspecies that dwell underground who are part monster, part cardboard. Living amidst them is Eggs, an abandoned child who was lovingly raised by these creatures that roam the night to recycle the discarded refuse left by people. They avoid human contact as much as possible. Who can blame them! There is the haughty and aristocratic Lord and Lady Portley-Rind, their inquisitive and precocious daughter, Winnie, and especially Archibald Snatcher, a scheming and hateful villain whose main goal is to do away with all Boxtrolls! \n\nAs with most animated films nowadays, the visual elements are far superior to the narrative story. The Boxtrolls are not the exception. While the script has some clever dialog, an involving tale, and its charming characters, the plot becomes too formula-driven and conventional. The screenplay by Irena Brignull and Adam Pava relies too heavily on slapstick and chase sequences rather than developing any deep characterizations. The Boxtrolls themselves lack any real distinctive personalities and that British droll humor is in short supply. Everything seems a tad too predictable and ordinary, except for the artistry of the filmmakers and their wonderful details with the elaborate settings, steam-punk gadgetry, and off-beat characters. Special kudos to the remarkable production design by Paul Lasaine. \n\nThe voice-over work by the actors (Isaac Hempstead-Wright, Elle Fanning, Jared Harris, Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, and Tracy Morgan) is highly accomplished and adds even more joy to the film, especially with Sir Ben Kingley's marvelous line delivery as the nasty baddie who completely steals the film. (In fact, Archibald is more interesting than our hero, Eggs, at least, as viewed in this film adaptation. Kingsley has created one of the best animated villains in years, although part of his great performance pays direct homage to Dame Edna.)\n\nDirectors Graham Annable and Anthony Stacchi painstakingly create a unique world of grime and clutter. They also allow the surreal elements to emerge to maximum effect, particularly in the underground sequences. Though the film lacks some cohesiveness in its story-telling, The Boxtrolls, more often than not, does think outside the box. With all its creative energy and technical inventiveness on display, even Roald Dahl would be proud.

Didn't expected much cause I really liked 94 version by Gillian Armstrong with Winona Ryder , Gabriel Byrne , Trini Alvarado , Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon.

The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make. They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice. Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.\n\n2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music. In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie &amp; Julia and Philomena.\n\nI cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.)

He doesn't insult Camille but asks her why she dances? \n\nHere we have the theme: Are we born to dance or do we become dancers that can be applied in all aspects of society? Are we born with a gift or do we become the gift?\n\nSecondly, the choreography is absolutely amazing. It compares with all the acrobatics seen on America's got talent or in movies such as Rocky Balboa. Remember his training against this Russian guy? We see two types of training, the natural versus the mechanical training using modern equipment. \n\nWhat about the competitive choreography between the two girls? Superbe!\n\nIf the film gave me shivers three times then I admit to the success of the film animation to have struck a chord in me. And, if my grandchild was able to relate to his life one scene which was the union of Félicie and as Odette (Carly Rae Jepsen) and which has also brought me back to when I bought tickets to the Ballet then I consider this animation a true marvel to which I give 10/10.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21071,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-12-14","keywords":"believe in yourself,redhead girl,motorcycle,rudeness,f rated","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2558834201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODY0MDQ2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ5MjMyMDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODY0MDQ2M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ5MjMyMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in 1879 Paris.

However, I don't think any kids will be reading this review.\n\nOverall, I thought this movie was disappointing. I thought Elmo would be stuck more in the Grouch city and the Grouches, but that's not how it happens here.

It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.\n\nWhat I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nAs far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.\n\nSpy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.\n\nWhat I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nAs far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.\n\nSpy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However, I don't think any kids will be reading this review.\n\nOverall, I thought this movie was disappointing. I thought Elmo would be stuck more in the Grouch city and the Grouches, but that's not how it happens here.

Still, despite very good reviews, there was always a severe lack of hype and passion it seemed (certainly here). Maybe that's why I was so surprised. Usually this kind of heavy-edited, heavy- flashback-intercutting-with-main-story film alienates me emotionally for that reason. Too much back and forth. I had the same problem with 2007's Into The Wild, which so often prevented me from getting too involved with it. For some reason I didn't have that problem here. The actual story, as well as the dramatic ticks in the flashbacks and even in the present, aren't anything we haven't seen before dozens of times. However, the film really managed work despite that. The editing I found to enhance the film immensely, and the specific style of the intercutting with her memories managed to make the film more powerful. \n\nI like Witherspoon just fine in Walk The Line, but it was all mostly surface-level. She was fun, but any lasting impact? Not at all. She's truly fantastic here, and she will get a very deserved nomination tomorrow. Now, everyone knows how much I'd been rooting for Laura Dern for a nomination. I hadn't seen it, but she's one of my favorite actresses. But so many reports of her role being super small, almost a cameo. Her role technically is super small, less than 10 minutes for sure, but the relationship between her and Witherspoon is the central relationship at the core here. Dern's presence is felt throughout to an incredible degree. And she really does have a meaty role for such short screen time. It reminds me of Jessica Chastain in The tree Of Life and also to Patricia Arquette in Boyhood, perfect depiction of that feeling of compassion and motherly love that is eternal. Dern is one of those actors that can move me with so little, so I don't think this was at all anything difficult for her, but either way, she manages to become such an undeniable, powerful part of the film. The editing is part of the reason that central relationship works, but the scenes Dern gets to convey her entire character are flawlessly acted and, so beautifully ethereal. I had feared for a while there that it would be such a small role she'd make no lasting impact, but of course she'd make an impact. It's Laura Dern after all."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-12-19","keywords":"hiking,grief,back to nature,long distance hiking,backpack","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4058885145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4MzM3OTE5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjAxMTgxMjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4MzM3OTE5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjAxMTgxMjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A chronicle of one woman's 1,100-mile solo hike undertaken as a way to recover from a recent catastrophe.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000702/","name":"Reese Witherspoon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000368/","name":"Laura Dern"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000451/","name":"Gaby Hoffmann"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0885249/","name":"Jean-Marc Vallée"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148124/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0373561/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0394984/","name":"Nick Hornby"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4952700/","name":"Cheryl Strayed"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The actual story, as well as the dramatic ticks in the flashbacks and even in the present, aren't anything we haven't seen before dozens of times. However, the film really managed work despite that. The editing I found to enhance the film immensely, and the specific style of the intercutting with her memories managed to make the film more powerful. \n\nI like Witherspoon just fine in Walk The Line, but it was all mostly surface-level. She was fun, but any lasting impact? Not at all. She's truly fantastic here, and she will get a very deserved nomination tomorrow. Now, everyone knows how much I'd been rooting for Laura Dern for a nomination. I hadn't seen it, but she's one of my favorite actresses. But so many reports of her role being super small, almost a cameo. Her role technically is super small, less than 10 minutes for sure, but the relationship between her and Witherspoon is the central relationship at the core here. Dern's presence is felt throughout to an incredible degree. And she really does have a meaty role for such short screen time. It reminds me of Jessica Chastain in The tree Of Life and also to Patricia Arquette in Boyhood, perfect depiction of that feeling of compassion and motherly love that is eternal. Dern is one of those actors that can move me with so little, so I don't think this was at all anything difficult for her, but either way, she manages to become such an undeniable, powerful part of the film. The editing is part of the reason that central relationship works, but the scenes Dern gets to convey her entire character are flawlessly acted and, so beautifully ethereal. I had feared for a while there that it would be such a small role she'd make no lasting impact, but of course she'd make an impact. It's Laura Dern after all.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-12-19","keywords":"hiking,grief,back to nature,long distance hiking,backpack","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4058885145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4MzM3OTE5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjAxMTgxMjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDc4MzM3OTE5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjAxMTgxMjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A chronicle of one woman's 1,100-mile solo hike undertaken as a way to recover from a recent catastrophe.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000702/","name":"Reese Witherspoon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000368/","name":"Laura Dern","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000451/","name":"Gaby Hoffmann"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0885249/","name":"Jean-Marc Vallée"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148124/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0373561/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0394984/","name":"Nick Hornby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4952700/","name":"Cheryl Strayed"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Sandra Bullock is an actress who falls into the latter category.  Yet, in this category, she is at the top of the tree and it is in films such as Miss Congeniality that she proves this.\n\nFor a fish out of water comedy, this is a film that plays to Bullock's qualities - her tomboy image from Speed, her warm humour and her ability to play for laughs and be deadpan.  As such, Bullock is allowed to shine from a castlist containing Michael Caine and Ben Bratt.  However, if I had one criticism, it would be that there are occasions when Caine just appears to be shamelessly mugging and camping it up for the camera to no real effect.\n\nThere are some genuinely funny moments, mostly centred around the pageant and it is nice to see such a movie which doesn't take itself or its setting too seriously.  Many of the contestants give good supporting performances and as such, it is hard to pick one out.\n\nOverall, it is a bit slight but anyone renting/buying this movie would surely know what to expect - familiar, funny and essentially sweet-natured - just like Sandra Bullock herself.\n\n8/10 - A good example of the genre.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":196350,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2001-04-11","keywords":"beauty contest,fbi federal bureau of investigation,knee high boots,boots,pageant","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Congeniality","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1980671001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwNDcxYjQtOTNmMy00YzA3LWFhNmQtMGZkYjY5N2Y0Y2MyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwNDcxYjQtOTNmMy00YzA3LWFhNmQtMGZkYjY5N2Y0Y2MyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Congeniality"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000323/","name":"Michael Caine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000973/","name":"Benjamin Bratt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0677953/","name":"Donald Petrie"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024939/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492909/","name":"Marc Lawrence"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0974301/","name":"Katie Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524095/","name":"Caryn Lucas"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Yet, in this category, she is at the top of the tree and it is in films such as Miss Congeniality that she proves this.\n\nFor a fish out of water comedy, this is a film that plays to Bullock's qualities - her tomboy image from Speed, her warm humour and her ability to play for laughs and be deadpan.  As such, Bullock is allowed to shine from a castlist containing Michael Caine and Ben Bratt.  However, if I had one criticism, it would be that there are occasions when Caine just appears to be shamelessly mugging and camping it up for the camera to no real effect.\n\nThere are some genuinely funny moments, mostly centred around the pageant and it is nice to see such a movie which doesn't take itself or its setting too seriously.  Many of the contestants give good supporting performances and as such, it is hard to pick one out.\n\nOverall, it is a bit slight but anyone renting/buying this movie would surely know what to expect - familiar, funny and essentially sweet-natured - just like Sandra Bullock herself.\n\n8/10 - A good example of the genre.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":196350,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2001-04-11","keywords":"beauty contest,fbi federal bureau of investigation,knee high boots,boots,pageant","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Miss Congeniality","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1980671001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwNDcxYjQtOTNmMy00YzA3LWFhNmQtMGZkYjY5N2Y0Y2MyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwNDcxYjQtOTNmMy00YzA3LWFhNmQtMGZkYjY5N2Y0Y2MyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Miss Congeniality","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000323/","name":"Michael Caine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000973/","name":"Benjamin Bratt"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0677953/","name":"Donald Petrie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040620/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024939/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0492909/","name":"Marc Lawrence","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0974301/","name":"Katie Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524095/","name":"Caryn Lucas"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.\n\nWhat I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nAs far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.\n\nSpy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Everything gels, and director Ivan Reitman catches us off-guard with moments of absurd hilarity.\n\nPerformances are likable all around, with Uma Thurman portraying G-Girl with believable ease. Luke Wilson is well-cast as the guy in over his head. Writing is solid, and direction keeps things breezy.\n\n'My Super Ex Girlfriend' is a thoroughly engaging, screwball comedy that's driven by a silly premise that works.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":63087,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2006-11-08","keywords":"superhero,supernatural power,superhero spoof,femme fatale,architect","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"My Super Ex-Girlfriend","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1419247897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE5ZThkMTYtZjc2MS00Y2VkLTgxODEtNWRkZWU2NTcwNGRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE5ZThkMTYtZjc2MS00Y2VkLTgxODEtNWRkZWU2NTcwNGRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000235/","name":"Uma Thurman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005561/","name":"Luke Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267506/","name":"Anna Faris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718645/","name":"Ivan Reitman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142539/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668309/","name":"Don Payne"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's been done before but never quite as meta as it was in Kingsman, actively referencing how similar the plot and archetypes are to James Bond while still having a refreshing novelty factor and interesting characters of its own - creating this whole new world for the over-the-top James Bond-esque adventures to take place while the real James Bond canon continues its serious, grounded story arc. \n\nWhile Kingsman was about setting up this elite organization and showing off their penchant for ridiculously elaborate action sequences, Spy has little exposition and throws you right into this hysterical world where Jude Law is the super suave secret agent and Melissa McCarthy acts as his eyes and ears back at headquarters. Jason Statham comes in later as a rogue agent who is as arrogant as he is oblivious. The movie doesn't itself seriously but it never goes into parody territory. These characters, as overblown and ridiculous as they are, still have relatable personalities, and you're willing to go on this crazy adventure with them right from the start. \n\nSpy is very much an action comedy - whether you view it more as an action movie or as a comedy is completely up to you. I found it hilarious within the first minute and was laughing heartily throughout the entire movie, but there's no denying that the action sequences are incredibly well done. Specifically, the fight between Susan Cooper (McCarthy) and a female assassin in a kitchen, the opening sequence of Cooper alerting Bradley Fine (Law) where enemies are while Fine sweeps them up in a rat maze full of baddies, and the scene with the car where Cooper mops the floor with a handful of terrorists with little to no effort. If you aren't laughing at the jokes, you can laugh at how insane and over-the-top the action is - either way, it's an incredibly fun time.\n\nWhat I find most compelling about Spy is how likable each character is. It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nAs far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.\n\nSpy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's not just McCarthy, Law, and Statham with a bunch of stoic supporting characters. No, even the supporting characters are hilarious and interesting. Miranda Hart plays Cooper's goofy friend who does dumb things with the best of intentions, Rose Byrne plays the villainous daughter of a rich terrorist and has some excellent back-and-forth bickering with McCarthy, and Peter Serafinowicz plays Aldo: a sleazy Frenchman who absolutely loves women and especially their boobs. They all have moments of hilarity; even the main antagonist played by Bobby Cannavale who is supposed to be a classy businessman has quirky one-liners and the funniest villain run I've seen in recent memory. Oh, and 50 Cent is in it playing 50 Cent. Yeah, it's as crazy as it sounds.\n\nAs far as lead performances go, this is the funniest Melissa McCarthy has ever been. This is the ideal role for her because her character has a serious job and a serious mission juxtaposed with McCarthy's snarky personality and usual shenanigans, making for some truly hysterical situations. Jason Statham, however, is the real highlight here. The man is brilliant in this role. He's a tough-guy agent that goes around bragging about how badass he is and goes on to do the stupidest things ever while still keeping a straight face and menacing persona - essentially a parody of his usual roles. His rants are comedy gold simply because it's Statham doing them. He proves here that he's not only one of the greatest action stars working today but also one of the funniest. The fact that he even agreed to this movie says a lot about Statham's attitude - he's a great sport and isn't afraid to make fun of himself, and I really hope this earns him more comedic roles in the future.\n\nSpy was everything I wanted it to be and more. I laughed harder at this movie than I did at most comedies in the past decade. The production value was fantastic, the pacing was perfect, and director Paul Feig clearly knows how to do comedy but now can add action to his resume. Everything about this movie works. It also allows James Bond to continue its serious endeavors, Kingsman to handle the classy yet gritty side of secret agents, while Spy focuses on the campy and silly nature of the whole affair. I sincerely hope this gets a franchise because there are too many great things happening for it not to get a sequel. On it's own however, Spy is an absolutely brilliant, perfectly casted satire that should not be missed by fans of action, comedy, or fun.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":236869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-05","keywords":"fellatio,prosthetic penis,vulgarity,hit in the crotch,male nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707571993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ3MjkyNTIxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODUyMTExNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A desk-bound CIA analyst volunteers to go undercover to infiltrate the world of a deadly arms dealer, and prevent diabolical global disaster.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565250/","name":"Melissa McCarthy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0409029/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0082450/","name":"Paul Feig"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A joke never has the same effect when you know the punch line in advance. But every once in a blue moon, a comedy comes along that is so thoughtful and meaningful in addition to being funny that after seeing it a dozen times and laughing less often, I start noticing its depth and insight. For me, no movie has so perfectly united hilarity with profundity as "Groundhog Day," which happens to be my favorite movie of all time.\n\nSuperficially, this film belongs roughly in the same genre as "All of Me" and "Liar Liar," comedies in which a character becomes the victim of some weird supernatural fate and must adapt to the insane logic of the situation. But Steve Martin and Jim Carrey are geniuses of physical comedy, whereas Bill Murray specializes in understatement. I can't imagine any other approach having worked for this film, where the world is going crazy around Phil the weatherman, Murray's hard-edged character who keeps his emotions bottled up. What makes the initial scenes in which he first discovers his fate so hilarious is the mounting panic in his demeanor even as he tries to act like everything's normal. All he can think of to say is, "I may be having a problem." Uh, no kidding. Throughout the rest of the film, he'll deliver similarly muted lines to describe his situation, like "My years are not advancing as fast as you might think." It's striking that a man who has all the time in the world would choose his words so carefully, but it reflects a well-conceived screenplay.\n\nIn this comedy, the laughs are reinforced by repetition. The absurdity of Phil discovering that he's repeating the same day is funny enough, but every time that alarm clock goes off, and the radio starts playing, "I Got You Babe," and Phil goes through the same motions and meets the same people and then goes out into the street to be accosted by the same annoying high school buddy ("Phiiiil?"), I laugh again because I'm reminded how funny it was the first time around. People who didn't like this film (I've met one or two) emphasize how annoying it is that everything gets repeated. I sort of understand that complaint, since jokes repeated over and over usually fail miserably. "Groundhog Day," however, works uniquely well because the situation gets increasingly absurd and Phil gets increasingly desperate with each day that fails to pass.\n\nThe film would have fizzled out quickly had it spent the entire hour-and-a-half showing Phil meeting the same people and doing the same things time and again. The fact that "Groundhog Day" avoids this fate is one of its more striking qualities, since most high-concept comedies of this sort fall apart in the third act. "Groundhog Day" is a rare example of one that completely follows through with its premise, leading from the initial situation logically to the ending. Only the Jeopardy scene feels like a skit that could have appeared anywhere. But this scene actually is placed wisely: it occurs when Phil is becoming increasingly bored and lethargic, and it is used to separate two hilarious scenes where he gives nutty television reports.\n\nIt is in the middle, centering on Phil's attempts to seduce Rita, when the film reveals itself to be more than just a comedy. The underlying implication of these scenes is that Phil's powers are less important than he thinks they are. He probably could have done the same things (such as his exploits with Nancy) under ordinary circumstances, without the hocus pocus. In the end, his powers don't matter, because Rita is too smart and sees right through him. She may not understand the full supernatural implications of what he's doing, but she senses that he's somehow manipulating the situation. Phil may think he's a god, but he isn't all-powerful.\n\nPhil's character development is convincing largely because we can so easily believe the situation would force him to look inward. Because he loves such a sincere woman as Rita, the only way he can finally impress her is by genuinely changing himself rather than faking it. The change he undergoes isn't an implausible leap, for he maintains many of the same basic character traits he had at the beginning, even though he becomes kinder and more caring. Earlier, Rita says that egocentrism is Phil's "defining characteristic," and, indeed, he doesn't stop being egocentric at the end; he merely learns to channel the egocentrism in a positive direction.\n\nI have trouble imagining any other actor having pulled this off. Murray is not the only comic actor to have proved himself capable of dramatic depth, but he's one of the few who can so seamlessly combine his humorous and serious side into the same character. And he's a master at conveying complex emotions through an apparent deadpan. When his delivery sounds stilted in this film, the effect is intentional, for he's playing a man whose life has become a script.\n\nThough this film has a serious message, it is still quintessentially a comedy. But it's a comedy that uses psychological exploration of a fascinating character to make its point. After the laughter has worn down, "Groundhog Day" turns out to be one of the richest and deepest films I've ever seen.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":595579,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1993-02-12","keywords":"trapped in a time loop,time loop,groundhog day,suicide,weatherman","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Groundhog Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1957600025","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVmMDg4NjAtZmZiYi00ZjkwLTlmZWItZjM4NGQ1MDgxOGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmVmMDg4NjAtZmZiYi00ZjkwLTlmZWItZjM4NGQ1MDgxOGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Groundhog Day"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000195/","name":"Bill Murray"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000510/","name":"Andie MacDowell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254402/","name":"Chris Elliott"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748035/","name":"Danny Rubin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000601/","name":"Harold Ramis"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Let's face it, Jules Verne's science no longer holds up in the present day, so we have to make modified versions of the stories for a modern audience (hence also the very entertaining updated version of Journey to the Center of the Earth: The Core).\n\nTo see this movie as a remake of the 1956 movie - which seems to be the position that many reviewers take - is completely faulty. This is a riff/homage to the original novel, having nothing whatsoever to do with any previous movie version.\n\nI thought Jackie Chan's part in this movie was great fun, and I was very entertained throughout.

The direction of the gallery requests the presence of an authority from the British Royal National Gallery for the opening solemnity. The board of the British gallery, trying to get rid off Bean, sends him to USA. The young American executive David Langley (Peter MacNicol) assumes that the clumsy Bean is a great authority in Arts, and invites him to stay at his home. It is unnecessary to say the confusions that he gets on in USA. I am not a follower of the character of Mr. Bean, but yesterday I laughed a lot. The silly story is so funny, that should be recommended for PMT and bad mood days.

Production quality is amazing. The story is complex and long but worth the payoff. The acting is great overall. The hero's are vulnerable in so many ways. For every ability they have they suffer from even worse flaws. This is an alternate universe that forks from historical events. Rorschach is my favorite anti hero of all time and the end for me is an emotional powerful climax thats always a gut punch. Soundtrack is spot on.

It's sandwiched between the fandom of the Burton and Nolan films while simultaneously blamed for leading to Batman and Robin. If you compare it to the darker and more gothic Burton films and are disappointed Keaton isn't still playing Batman, of course you're not gonna enjoy it. If you compare it to the more serious neo-realism of the Nolan films, again you're not gonna enjoy it. What is it you ask? Batman Forever essentially plays out like a live action cartoon and it does this very well. If you watch it through that lens instead of judging it for what it's not you'll find that Batman Forever actually has superior continuity and pacing than any other Batman film except maybe the 1966 version. This is coming from someone who's favorite film is Batman 1989 and a big Tim Burton fan. It honestly baffles me to hear people rave about how great Batman Returns is and then go on to bash Batman Forever. While Returns has a ton going for it, it really suffers from the same core problem as Batman and Robin; the director getting too cute with creative control. All Joel Schumacher did was set out to make a fun super-hero film with something for everyone to enjoy and I honestly think he succeeded with Forever. With Batman and Robin he went too flamboyant just like Burton went too zany and weird with Returns. The first time around both directors got it right testing the waters with their own respective styles. Everything in the film is very cartoonish and if you appreciate it from that perspective it's really quite masterful in a lot of subtle and not so subtle ways. Although Batman The Animated Series was largely influenced by the Burton movies Forever really seems like it's bringing that onto the big screen with real actors and real sets which is quite a feat. Schumacher just added more color and neon which honestly is a welcome change from the stark art deco gothic flavor present in Returns. Nothing wrong with that flavor in Returns, it's just that Burton went all in and we didn't necessarily need more of the same. Batman Returns actually has considerably different art direction from Batman 1989 yet you rarely hear fans complain about that difference or even acknowledge it.\n\nNicole Kidman is perfectly cast as Chase Meridian and I like Chris O'Donnell as Robin even though he was probably a tad old. Everyone criticizes Val Kilmer for being too bland compared to Keaton but honestly the latter wouldn't have worked at all in the film the way it was done. Since Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are both such strong personalities a more stoic Kilmer contrasts that well. Batman Forever really is Jim Carrey's vehicle though. You watch Batman Forever for Jim Carrey the same way you watch Batman 1989 for Jack Nicholson.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":241256,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1995-06-16","keywords":"bruce wayne character,batman character,alfred pennyworth character,harvey dent character,james gordon character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1146535449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTgwYzBkNDYtMjkzYy00MDk2LWFhN2MtN2M0NDQxNmQ5ZGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTgwYzBkNDYtMjkzYy00MDk2LWFhN2MtN2M0NDQxNmQ5ZGE2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXN3aWZ0dw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Batman must battle former district attorney Harvey Dent, who is now Two-Face and Edward Nygma, The Riddler with help from an amorous psychologist and a young circus acrobat who becomes his sidekick, Robin."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000174/","name":"Val Kilmer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000120/","name":"Jim Carrey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001708/","name":"Joel Schumacher"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106129/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004170/","name":"Bob Kane"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0060761/","name":"Lee Batchler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0060760/","name":"Janet Scott Batchler"}],"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The visionary director manages, through the undaunted and determined flow of fans with the #releasethesnydercut movement, to bring his spectacular vision of the Justice League, presenting a spectacular film with parsimony and dedication, as only a true DC fan can do. Not only the film is deepened with a wealth of filmed material that no one ever imagined existed, but it manages to redeem itself and to fight with tight fists the previous Justice League (2017) which was a total and a colossal flop in every aspect (not Snyder's fault, of course). In this Snyder Cut all the questions that the Theatrical Cut did not give are answered, digging into the background of the characters and giving valid reasons where it seemed everything was thrown into turmoil and even randomly placed; moreover, the full potential of Snyder's direction is expressed through his unique and particular shots, also implementing and improving both CGI and cinematography, which are the perfect accompaniment to the director's vision. The four hours of the Snyder Cut are nothing more than a blaze of beauty towards these heroes, where with the old release seemed all too strange that they (production &amp; co.) had offered so little from such a talented and resourceful director. Recall that the Snyder Cut must be contextualized and must be interposed in a timeline that had precedents and sequels in the DC Extended Universe, but now it is all to be reviewed, all to be rewritten, all to be reset. This film, as well as citing a similar case (although not entirely), namely The Godfather III Coda, totally redeems the film, putting everything in a new light, entrancing both fans and insiders and in doing so recreating a films from 0 (in fact much of the Theatrical Cut material is not present), bringing to light aspects never seen before and better set together and doing so, finally, being meaningful. Commendable and mouth-watering movie to learn more and that opens up worlds as well as in DC comics. Bravo Zack Snyder, Bravo. Justice has been served for the Justice League.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":334983,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2021-03-18","keywords":"superhero,extended version,dc extended universe,badass,dc comics","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2343551001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc5Zjc2YTMtM2IwZC00OTAyLThjZTktNGU3MjVjNTY5YThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc5Zjc2YTMtM2IwZC00OTAyLThjZTktNGU3MjVjNTY5YThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Zack Snyder's Justice League, determined to ensure Superman’s (Henry Cavill) ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) aligns forces with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions.

The visionary director manages, through the undaunted and determined flow of fans with the #releasethesnydercut movement, to bring his spectacular vision of the Justice League, presenting a spectacular film with parsimony and dedication, as only a true DC fan can do. Not only the film is deepened with a wealth of filmed material that no one ever imagined existed, but it manages to redeem itself and to fight with tight fists the previous Justice League (2017) which was a total and a colossal flop in every aspect (not Snyder's fault, of course). In this Snyder Cut all the questions that the Theatrical Cut did not give are answered, digging into the background of the characters and giving valid reasons where it seemed everything was thrown into turmoil and even randomly placed; moreover, the full potential of Snyder's direction is expressed through his unique and particular shots, also implementing and improving both CGI and cinematography, which are the perfect accompaniment to the director's vision. The four hours of the Snyder Cut are nothing more than a blaze of beauty towards these heroes, where with the old release seemed all too strange that they (production &amp; co.) had offered so little from such a talented and resourceful director. Recall that the Snyder Cut must be contextualized and must be interposed in a timeline that had precedents and sequels in the DC Extended Universe, but now it is all to be reviewed, all to be rewritten, all to be reset. This film, as well as citing a similar case (although not entirely), namely The Godfather III Coda, totally redeems the film, putting everything in a new light, entrancing both fans and insiders and in doing so recreating a films from 0 (in fact much of the Theatrical Cut material is not present), bringing to light aspects never seen before and better set together and doing so, finally, being meaningful. Commendable and mouth-watering movie to learn more and that opens up worlds as well as in DC comics. Bravo Zack Snyder, Bravo. Justice has been served for the Justice League.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":334983,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2021-03-18","keywords":"superhero,extended version,dc extended universe,badass,dc comics","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2343551001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc5Zjc2YTMtM2IwZC00OTAyLThjZTktNGU3MjVjNTY5YThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzc5Zjc2YTMtM2IwZC00OTAyLThjZTktNGU3MjVjNTY5YThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Zack Snyder's Justice League, determined to ensure Superman’s (Henry Cavill) ultimate sacrifice was not in vain, Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck) aligns forces with Diana Prince (Gal Gadot) with plans to recruit a team of metahumans to protect the world from an approaching threat of catastrophic proportions.

I like Nicolas Cage and that is why I went to see this movie.\n\nThe movie is about a magician Cris Johnson (Cage) who can see his own future for only 2 minutes ahead. The FBI Officer (Julianne Moore) is behind him to seek his help to uncover a nuclear weapon post in LA; the terrorist group is after him because they too want to be ahead of FBI with the help of Cage, but Cage does not want to help anyone and is on a run and his purpose is to seek a girl (Jessica Biel) whose future he can see for a longer period. The movie is about how Cage gets involved in helping FBI  only to realize in the end that he is able to save his girl friend instead of saving 8 million population of LA. The last scene of the movie (that I will not tell now and spoil the show) kept me unsatisfied with the movie.\n\nNicolas Cage has produced the movie himself. Lee Tamahori (Sopranos, Die Another Day, Along came a Spider fame) has directed the movie. The movie is based on a novel called "Golden Man".\n\nEven though the story is old, the format of telling it, is new. From the first scene the director without wasting any time tells you that Cage can see his future and then takes you into unwinding of action, and never let go the pace of the movie. The movie has lots of twists and turns; mostly predictable  once we know that hero can see the future; but still maintains interest throughout.\n\nNicolas Cage looks a bit haggard but has acted well. Juliaane Moore and beautiful Jessica Biel have nothing extra-ordinary to do and their characters help the movie go forward. The movie has some good actions scenes and few funny moments. Funny moments because the Director allows the audience to see all the options Cage can think and see in future  and then chooses one that best suiting him.\n\nI am having this feeling that Nicolas Cage is trying to re-invent himself in a much remembered screen character that can give him at least a few more innings as sequels. His choosing Ghost Rider and now this character of Next  both have tremendous scope for sequels like James Bond, Spiderman, Superman, Die Hard, etc. Sadly with box office not ticking the counters strongly  the hope of Cage does not seem to being materializing soon.\n\n(Stars 6 out of 10)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153648,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-05-30","keywords":"woman in jeopardy,tape over mouth,7 eleven store,time traveler,fowards time travel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Next","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1083769113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhjNjBlYWItMTFlNy00MzQzLTk1MGQtNTI4M2M5MGM4YTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhjNjBlYWItMTFlNy00MzQzLTk1MGQtNTI4M2M5MGM4YTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004754/","name":"Jessica Biel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848414/","name":"Lee Tamahori"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011877/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0325778/","name":"Gary Goldman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378144/","name":"Jonathan Hensleigh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0076602/","name":"Paul Bernbaum"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I have no history with this franchise as a graphic novel and can only judge as a fan of the movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":525560,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2009-03-11","keywords":"rape,conspiracy,doomsday clock,false promise of the american dream,nihilist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [ES]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi240565017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUyNTNhMDUtOGYyZC00YTk5LWJiNTYtMTlmYzIwM2Q3YzNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWdhbWF6b2E@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUyNTNhMDUtOGYyZC00YTk5LWJiNTYtMTlmYzIwM2Q3YzNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWdhbWF6b2E@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355097/","name":"Jackie Earle Haley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001303/","name":"Carla Gugino"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1733301/","name":"Dave Gibbons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0371684/","name":"David Hayter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874844/","name":"Alex Tse"],"duration":"PT2H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I like Nicolas Cage and that is why I went to see this movie.\n\nThe movie is about a magician Cris Johnson (Cage) who can see his own future for only 2 minutes ahead. The FBI Officer (Julianne Moore) is behind him to seek his help to uncover a nuclear weapon post in LA; the terrorist group is after him because they too want to be ahead of FBI with the help of Cage, but Cage does not want to help anyone and is on a run and his purpose is to seek a girl (Jessica Biel) whose future he can see for a longer period. The movie is about how Cage gets involved in helping FBI  only to realize in the end that he is able to save his girl friend instead of saving 8 million population of LA.

Lee Tamahori (Sopranos, Die Another Day, Along came a Spider fame) has directed the movie. The movie is based on a novel called "Golden Man".\n\nEven though the story is old, the format of telling it, is new. From the first scene the director without wasting any time tells you that Cage can see his future and then takes you into unwinding of action, and never let go the pace of the movie. The movie has lots of twists and turns; mostly predictable  once we know that hero can see the future; but still maintains interest throughout.\n\nNicolas Cage looks a bit haggard but has acted well. Juliaane Moore and beautiful Jessica Biel have nothing extra-ordinary to do and their characters help the movie go forward. The movie has some good actions scenes and few funny moments. Funny moments because the Director allows the audience to see all the options Cage can think and see in future  and then chooses one that best suiting him.\n\nI am having this feeling that Nicolas Cage is trying to re-invent himself in a much remembered screen character that can give him at least a few more innings as sequels. His choosing Ghost Rider and now this character of Next  both have tremendous scope for sequels like James Bond, Spiderman, Superman, Die Hard, etc. Sadly with box office not ticking the counters strongly  the hope of Cage does not seem to being materializing soon.\n\n(Stars 6 out of 10)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153648,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-05-30","keywords":"woman in jeopardy,tape over mouth,7 eleven store,time traveler,fowards time travel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Next","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1083769113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhjNjBlYWItMTFlNy00MzQzLTk1MGQtNTI4M2M5MGM4YTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjhjNjBlYWItMTFlNy00MzQzLTk1MGQtNTI4M2M5MGM4YTU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000115/","name":"Nicolas Cage"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004754/","name":"Jessica Biel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848414/","name":"Lee Tamahori"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011877/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0325778/","name":"Gary Goldman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378144/","name":"Jonathan Hensleigh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0076602/","name":"Paul Bernbaum"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's sandwiched between the fandom of the Burton and Nolan films while simultaneously blamed for leading to Batman and Robin. If you compare it to the darker and more gothic Burton films and are disappointed Keaton isn't still playing Batman, of course you're not gonna enjoy it. If you compare it to the more serious neo-realism of the Nolan films, again you're not gonna enjoy it. What is it you ask? Batman Forever essentially plays out like a live action cartoon and it does this very well. If you watch it through that lens instead of judging it for what it's not you'll find that Batman Forever actually has superior continuity and pacing than any other Batman film except maybe the 1966 version. This is coming from someone who's favorite film is Batman 1989 and a big Tim Burton fan. It honestly baffles me to hear people rave about how great Batman Returns is and then go on to bash Batman Forever. While Returns has a ton going for it, it really suffers from the same core problem as Batman and Robin; the director getting too cute with creative control. All Joel Schumacher did was set out to make a fun super-hero film with something for everyone to enjoy and I honestly think he succeeded with Forever. With Batman and Robin he went too flamboyant just like Burton went too zany and weird with Returns.

It's sandwiched between the fandom of the Burton and Nolan films while simultaneously blamed for leading to Batman and Robin. If you compare it to the darker and more gothic Burton films and are disappointed Keaton isn't still playing Batman, of course you're not gonna enjoy it. If you compare it to the more serious neo-realism of the Nolan films, again you're not gonna enjoy it. What is it you ask? Batman Forever essentially plays out like a live action cartoon and it does this very well. If you watch it through that lens instead of judging it for what it's not you'll find that Batman Forever actually has superior continuity and pacing than any other Batman film except maybe the 1966 version. This is coming from someone who's favorite film is Batman 1989 and a big Tim Burton fan. It honestly baffles me to hear people rave about how great Batman Returns is and then go on to bash Batman Forever. While Returns has a ton going for it, it really suffers from the same core problem as Batman and Robin; the director getting too cute with creative control. All Joel Schumacher did was set out to make a fun super-hero film with something for everyone to enjoy and I honestly think he succeeded with Forever. With Batman and Robin he went too flamboyant just like Burton went too zany and weird with Returns. The first time around both directors got it right testing the waters with their own respective styles. Everything in the film is very cartoonish and if you appreciate it from that perspective it's really quite masterful in a lot of subtle and not so subtle ways. Although Batman The Animated Series was largely influenced by the Burton movies Forever really seems like it's bringing that onto the big screen with real actors and real sets which is quite a feat.

Cage is Cage, that stoic actor who seems somehow devoid of emotion in most of his films. Mendez is hot, goes without saying, and equals Cage's level of emotion. Sam Elliot and Peter Fonda are the saving graces of the film, both adding a dimension of emotion lacking in the main characters. The prelude scenes of young Johnny and Roxanne are somewhat necessary, but could have been trimmed down to include more footage of the Ghost Rider and his missions. I haven't seen the newest film, just released at this writing, but hopefully the characters have been "fleshed out" and the plot concentrates more on the present than the past. With Cage being the only holdover for the new movie, perhaps the new directors can up the game a bit.

If you compare it to the darker and more gothic Burton films and are disappointed Keaton isn't still playing Batman, of course you're not gonna enjoy it. If you compare it to the more serious neo-realism of the Nolan films, again you're not gonna enjoy it. What is it you ask? Batman Forever essentially plays out like a live action cartoon and it does this very well. If you watch it through that lens instead of judging it for what it's not you'll find that Batman Forever actually has superior continuity and pacing than any other Batman film except maybe the 1966 version. This is coming from someone who's favorite film is Batman 1989 and a big Tim Burton fan. It honestly baffles me to hear people rave about how great Batman Returns is and then go on to bash Batman Forever. While Returns has a ton going for it, it really suffers from the same core problem as Batman and Robin; the director getting too cute with creative control. All Joel Schumacher did was set out to make a fun super-hero film with something for everyone to enjoy and I honestly think he succeeded with Forever. With Batman and Robin he went too flamboyant just like Burton went too zany and weird with Returns. The first time around both directors got it right testing the waters with their own respective styles. Everything in the film is very cartoonish and if you appreciate it from that perspective it's really quite masterful in a lot of subtle and not so subtle ways. Although Batman The Animated Series was largely influenced by the Burton movies Forever really seems like it's bringing that onto the big screen with real actors and real sets which is quite a feat. Schumacher just added more color and neon which honestly is a welcome change from the stark art deco gothic flavor present in Returns. Nothing wrong with that flavor in Returns, it's just that Burton went all in and we didn't necessarily need more of the same. Batman Returns actually has considerably different art direction from Batman 1989 yet you rarely hear fans complain about that difference or even acknowledge it.\n\nNicole Kidman is perfectly cast as Chase Meridian and I like Chris O'Donnell as Robin even though he was probably a tad old. Everyone criticizes Val Kilmer for being too bland compared to Keaton but honestly the latter wouldn't have worked at all in the film the way it was done. Since Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carrey are both such strong personalities a more stoic Kilmer contrasts that well. Batman Forever really is Jim Carrey's vehicle though.

Even if one doesn't like the characters or the story lines, it's worth watching just to see beautiful Hawaii and the wonderful sun (for British viewers, this is probably the only chance we'll get to see the sun until June, if then!).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":69142,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-09-20","keywords":"hawaii,teamwork,yakuza,police,swimwear","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1533927/","name":"Alex O'Loughlin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004790/","name":"Scott Caan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1711334/","name":"Taylor Wily"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176022/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314568/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006997/","name":"Peter M.

This four-disc set is a welcome flashback to the show's humble beginnings, when it wasn't supposed to be the most heart-pounding show on television, and succeeded on will, not on hype.\n\nThe central characters in the first season are Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), ER Residents Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) and pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney), Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), Surgical Resident Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq la Salle) and his protégé, third-year med student John Carter (Noah Wyle, the only actor to remain on the show through the entire run).

At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.\n\nStandout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.\n\nThe show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism. This is exaggerated a little, but still a valid point; rarely an episode goes by without something in the line of an unexpected pregnancy, a suicide attempt, a violent skirmish between doctor and patient, or (in one outrageous case) a 12-year old gang member brining his Glock into a trauma room to try and finish another 12-year old off.

For every one intelligent, caring episode comes four or five exercises in downbeat, melodramatic soap opera which sap all the energy out of the show's still-present technical mastery. This four-disc set is a welcome flashback to the show's humble beginnings, when it wasn't supposed to be the most heart-pounding show on television, and succeeded on will, not on hype.\n\nThe central characters in the first season are Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), ER Residents Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) and pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney), Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), Surgical Resident Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq la Salle) and his protégé, third-year med student John Carter (Noah Wyle, the only actor to remain on the show through the entire run). They brought a fresh edge to the oft-repeated world of medical drama, helped greatly by the first television show, in my estimation, to ever put actual intelligence into the presentation. On ER, the cameras move, the people move, the consistent hustle and bustle of an actual environment is palpable, and not simply a setpiece. It's interesting to note that although the show was never broadcast in widescreen until 2001, in the middle of it's seventh season, these first episodes are all presented in the wider format. At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.\n\nStandout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.\n\nThe show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism. This is exaggerated a little, but still a valid point; rarely an episode goes by without something in the line of an unexpected pregnancy, a suicide attempt, a violent skirmish between doctor and patient, or (in one outrageous case) a 12-year old gang member brining his Glock into a trauma room to try and finish another 12-year old off.

For every one intelligent, caring episode comes four or five exercises in downbeat, melodramatic soap opera which sap all the energy out of the show's still-present technical mastery. This four-disc set is a welcome flashback to the show's humble beginnings, when it wasn't supposed to be the most heart-pounding show on television, and succeeded on will, not on hype.\n\nThe central characters in the first season are Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), ER Residents Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) and pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney), Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), Surgical Resident Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq la Salle) and his protégé, third-year med student John Carter (Noah Wyle, the only actor to remain on the show through the entire run). They brought a fresh edge to the oft-repeated world of medical drama, helped greatly by the first television show, in my estimation, to ever put actual intelligence into the presentation. On ER, the cameras move, the people move, the consistent hustle and bustle of an actual environment is palpable, and not simply a setpiece. It's interesting to note that although the show was never broadcast in widescreen until 2001, in the middle of it's seventh season, these first episodes are all presented in the wider format. At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.\n\nStandout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.\n\nThe show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism. This is exaggerated a little, but still a valid point; rarely an episode goes by without something in the line of an unexpected pregnancy, a suicide attempt, a violent skirmish between doctor and patient, or (in one outrageous case) a 12-year old gang member brining his Glock into a trauma room to try and finish another 12-year old off. Still, the show displayed remarkable resilience in almost always rising to become greater than the sum of its parts. Naturally, that ability has waned and virtually disappeared, but these episodes are no less enjoyable as a result of that."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1994-09-19","keywords":"hospital,emergency room,sleeping,medical care,medical doctor","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000381/","name":"Anthony Edwards"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000523/","name":"Julianna Margulies"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093758/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037310/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Er: Season 15","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2463087897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Er: Season 15"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Buy the 1st Season DVD","reviewBody":"ER in its present, 2003 form is a schizophrenic mess. For every one intelligent, caring episode comes four or five exercises in downbeat, melodramatic soap opera which sap all the energy out of the show's still-present technical mastery. This four-disc set is a welcome flashback to the show's humble beginnings, when it wasn't supposed to be the most heart-pounding show on television, and succeeded on will, not on hype.\n\nThe central characters in the first season are Chief Resident Dr. Mark Greene (Anthony Edwards), ER Residents Susan Lewis (Sherry Stringfield) and pediatrician Doug Ross (George Clooney), Head Nurse Carol Hathaway (Julianna Marguiles), Surgical Resident Dr. Peter Benton (Eriq la Salle) and his protégé, third-year med student John Carter (Noah Wyle, the only actor to remain on the show through the entire run). They brought a fresh edge to the oft-repeated world of medical drama, helped greatly by the first television show, in my estimation, to ever put actual intelligence into the presentation. On ER, the cameras move, the people move, the consistent hustle and bustle of an actual environment is palpable, and not simply a setpiece. It's interesting to note that although the show was never broadcast in widescreen until 2001, in the middle of it's seventh season, these first episodes are all presented in the wider format. At first it might seem like hubris, but most of them fit the frame very well, with shots composed and staged for the wider picture - it's not `cinematic' just for its own sake.\n\nStandout episodes from the season include the exposition-heavy `Pilot' which still found time for drama; `Blizzard' which was a tour-de-force of film, editing, and cutting edge medical realism; `Hit &amp; Run' &amp; `Sleepless in Chicago' which dealt with the heavy burden of juggling personal &amp; professional medical care, as well as Carter's development as a doctor; and `Love's Labor Lost', an absolute masterpiece from every angle: drama, directing, scripting, staging, scoring, every cosmic tumbler clicked into place for this episode centered around Greene's tragic triumph in the case of a pregnancy gone bad.\n\nThe show took a few (deserved) knocks for being shamelessly convenient in its storylines and ignoring the realities of daily hospital structure in favor of sensationalism. This is exaggerated a little, but still a valid point; rarely an episode goes by without something in the line of an unexpected pregnancy, a suicide attempt, a violent skirmish between doctor and patient, or (in one outrageous case) a 12-year old gang member brining his Glock into a trauma room to try and finish another 12-year old off. Still, the show displayed remarkable resilience in almost always rising to become greater than the sum of its parts. Naturally, that ability has waned and virtually disappeared, but these episodes are no less enjoyable as a result of that.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1994-09-19","keywords":"hospital,emergency room,sleeping,medical care,medical doctor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000381/","name":"Anthony Edwards","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000523/","name":"Julianna Margulies"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093758/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037310/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Er: Season 15","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2463087897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Er: Season 15"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Naturally, that ability has waned and virtually disappeared, but these episodes are no less enjoyable as a result of that.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":53661,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1994-09-19","keywords":"hospital,emergency room,sleeping,medical care,medical doctor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000381/","name":"Anthony Edwards","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000523/","name":"Julianna Margulies"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093758/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0037310/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000341/","name":"Michael Crichton"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Er: Season 15","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2463087897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg1YmVhZjEtZmFlMC00NGNiLWIyODgtNjBjNTc2ZTZmNjE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Er: Season 15"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A loose remake of Hitchcock's "Dial M For Murder" 2. Michael Douglas is directed horribly in some scenes 3. Poor dialogue at times\n\nDial M For Murder is better of the 2, but this isn't bad, just not directed very well by a goodish director. Firstly, the framing is off at times, resulting in poor editing which the picture didn't need. 2 characters can fit in one frame without resorting to close-ups which add no emotions to the characters.\n\nMichael Douglas's performance wasn't good at all in some scenes, a face expression can say a 1000 words. He practically gave away clues to the police just by unconvincing expressions on his face. This is the director's fault!\n\nAndrew Davis can produce better than this. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters.\n\nThe twists try to shake off Hitchcock's original, but at times it becomes sloppy. The finale is extremely disappointing, very tried and so damn boring!\n\nI watched this in aspect ratio 1.78:1 (16:9).\n\nAverage, but not horrid.

A loose remake of Hitchcock's "Dial M For Murder" 2. Michael Douglas is directed horribly in some scenes 3. Poor dialogue at times\n\nDial M For Murder is better of the 2, but this isn't bad, just not directed very well by a goodish director. Firstly, the framing is off at times, resulting in poor editing which the picture didn't need. 2 characters can fit in one frame without resorting to close-ups which add no emotions to the characters.\n\nMichael Douglas's performance wasn't good at all in some scenes, a face expression can say a 1000 words. He practically gave away clues to the police just by unconvincing expressions on his face. This is the director's fault!\n\nAndrew Davis can produce better than this. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters.\n\nThe twists try to shake off Hitchcock's original, but at times it becomes sloppy. The finale is extremely disappointing, very tried and so damn boring!\n\nI watched this in aspect ratio 1.78:1 (16:9).\n\nAverage, but not horrid. I can't say too much just in case you haven't seen it :)","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82336,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1998-06-05","keywords":"woman in jeopardy,money,urban setting,cell phone,murder","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Perfect Murder","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2813591833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE1YmE1MTEtOTU5MC00NmMxLWJlMTUtMTdkZTgxYTcyOTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE1YmE1MTEtOTU5MC00NmMxLWJlMTUtMTdkZTgxYTcyOTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000569/","name":"Gwyneth Paltrow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001112/","name":"Andrew Davis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044240/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461425/","name":"Frederick Knott","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0446761/","name":"Patrick Smith Kelly"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
