Besides, I've been watching another Wolf Production since 1999 and that was good enough for me.

I feel in love with Chicago PD because of the zest and criminal kick-ass and I was hooked.\n\nWhen Chicago Fire crossed over with Chicago PD recently, I was forced to watch Chicago Fire. Hummm, Chicago Fire very interesting and exciting I thought. I went to HBO On Demand and watched Season 2 of Chicago Fire. Let me tell you, I didn't cook, I didn't answer my phone, I ordered food delivery service and didn't move off of my sofa(only for bbreak) until I watched every episode. I then went to a local retail store and bought Season 1 and the disconnect from the world started all over again. By now you know where my review is going.\n\nWatching Chicago Fire help me to understand Detective Voight, Dawson etc.. and how Chicago PD was piloted. I was upset with me for not watching Chicago Fire initially. Readers, to understand Chicago PD, you have to watch Chicago Fire. I love the intertwining of the shows. It is so damn interesting.\n\nChicago Fire is a potpourri of diversity, family, loyalty, emotions and laughter. A show that promotes life/death,the response and the danger firefighters face everyday, gives me a deeper respect for my local firefighter and EMT services.\n\nI commend Mr. Wolf for having such great writers and actors/actress, I am humbled. I am aware it's only entertainment. However it's entertainment in a true and realistic form.\n\nOne of the Best Shows on TV.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50700,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-10-10","keywords":"fire department,firefighter,rescue,rescue team,coworker relationship","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1978325/","name":"Taylor Kinney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831601/","name":"Christian Stolte"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0907708/","name":"Eamonn Walker"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104973/","name":"Michael Brandt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0351929/","name":"Derek Haas"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 First Look","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1918481177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NzAxNDQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwMzEwNzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM0NzAxNDQxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzcwMzEwNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Get a first look at Season 4 of "Chicago Fire.""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A show that promotes life/death,the response and the danger firefighters face everyday, gives me a deeper respect for my local firefighter and EMT services.\n\nI commend Mr. Wolf for having such great writers and actors/actress, I am humbled.

    <desc lang="pt">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

I hope this is one show CBS will pick up year after year!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":81434,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2000-10-06","keywords":"crime scene investigation,las vegas nevada,crime lab,police,detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000401/","name":"Laurence Fishburne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001339/","name":"Marg Helgenberger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0247040/","name":"George Eads"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

In some cases they work, like Angel which has become a show of its own. On the other hand the Star Trek spin-offs (more so the later ones) have becoming mere clones of the show they have spawned from. It is difficult to make it work. You can try and be different and the fan base from the originating show could hate you. Be too similar and the counter effect it that many will call it nothing but a clone. While CSI:Miami is more or less the same show as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation it is still a series that is well worth watching and most of it is down to the reasons that the originating series was worth watching. Fantastic writing, feature film production values and a good cast. While in Crime Scene Investigation the casting is first class here were are merely in good territory. The cast here don't seem to share the same chemistry as Grissom and friends, although whether or  not this is deliberate I'm not sure.\n\nWith regards to casting what they do have in common is a superb central male lead. David Caruso is a fine actor, was so in the first season of NYPD Blue. Here he is incredible. Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team.

In some cases they work, like Angel which has become a show of its own. On the other hand the Star Trek spin-offs (more so the later ones) have becoming mere clones of the show they have spawned from. It is difficult to make it work. You can try and be different and the fan base from the originating show could hate you. Be too similar and the counter effect it that many will call it nothing but a clone. While CSI:Miami is more or less the same show as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation it is still a series that is well worth watching and most of it is down to the reasons that the originating series was worth watching. Fantastic writing, feature film production values and a good cast. While in Crime Scene Investigation the casting is first class here were are merely in good territory. The cast here don't seem to share the same chemistry as Grissom and friends, although whether or  not this is deliberate I'm not sure.\n\nWith regards to casting what they do have in common is a superb central male lead. David Caruso is a fine actor, was so in the first season of NYPD Blue. Here he is incredible. Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for.

William L. Petersen is the coolest of the cool as Gil Grissom.  I've followed his career since I first saw him in To Live and Die in L.A.  He's an amazing actor and he heads up a cast of amazing actors as well.  This show really keeps you on the edge of your seat as the investigators literally take a crime scene that appears to leave them with nothing to go on.  The investigators take nothing and turn it into something amazing as each crime is solved right in front of you and you as the viewer, never see it coming!  Wow!  I hope this is one show CBS will pick up year after year!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":81434,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2000-10-06","keywords":"crime scene investigation,las vegas nevada,crime lab,police,detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000401/","name":"Laurence Fishburne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001339/","name":"Marg Helgenberger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0247040/","name":"George Eads"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series.

It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team.

In some cases they work, like Angel which has become a show of its own. On the other hand the Star Trek spin-offs (more so the later ones) have becoming mere clones of the show they have spawned from. It is difficult to make it work. You can try and be different and the fan base from the originating show could hate you. Be too similar and the counter effect it that many will call it nothing but a clone. While CSI:Miami is more or less the same show as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation it is still a series that is well worth watching and most of it is down to the reasons that the originating series was worth watching. Fantastic writing, feature film production values and a good cast. While in Crime Scene Investigation the casting is first class here were are merely in good territory. The cast here don't seem to share the same chemistry as Grissom and friends, although whether or  not this is deliberate I'm not sure.\n\nWith regards to casting what they do have in common is a superb central male lead. David Caruso is a fine actor, was so in the first season of NYPD Blue. Here he is incredible. Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for. In saying that the show is still worth watching and is perhaps the first step in what is looking like a growing franchise."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-09-23","keywords":"place name in title,city name in title,city in title,united states of america,usa","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000325/","name":"David Caruso"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698346/","name":"Emily Procter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735226/","name":"Adam Rodriguez"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231929/","name":"Ann Donahue"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578856/","name":"Carol Mendelsohn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

In some cases they work, like Angel which has become a show of its own. On the other hand the Star Trek spin-offs (more so the later ones) have becoming mere clones of the show they have spawned from. It is difficult to make it work. You can try and be different and the fan base from the originating show could hate you. Be too similar and the counter effect it that many will call it nothing but a clone. While CSI:Miami is more or less the same show as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation it is still a series that is well worth watching and most of it is down to the reasons that the originating series was worth watching. Fantastic writing, feature film production values and a good cast. While in Crime Scene Investigation the casting is first class here were are merely in good territory. The cast here don't seem to share the same chemistry as Grissom and friends, although whether or  not this is deliberate I'm not sure.\n\nWith regards to casting what they do have in common is a superb central male lead. David Caruso is a fine actor, was so in the first season of NYPD Blue. Here he is incredible. Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either.

You can try and be different and the fan base from the originating show could hate you. Be too similar and the counter effect it that many will call it nothing but a clone.

Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for.

In some cases they work, like Angel which has become a show of its own. On the other hand the Star Trek spin-offs (more so the later ones) have becoming mere clones of the show they have spawned from. It is difficult to make it work. You can try and be different and the fan base from the originating show could hate you. Be too similar and the counter effect it that many will call it nothing but a clone. While CSI:Miami is more or less the same show as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation it is still a series that is well worth watching and most of it is down to the reasons that the originating series was worth watching. Fantastic writing, feature film production values and a good cast. While in Crime Scene Investigation the casting is first class here were are merely in good territory. The cast here don't seem to share the same chemistry as Grissom and friends, although whether or  not this is deliberate I'm not sure.\n\nWith regards to casting what they do have in common is a superb central male lead. David Caruso is a fine actor, was so in the first season of NYPD Blue. Here he is incredible. Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for. In saying that the show is still worth watching and is perhaps the first step in what is looking like a growing franchise.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-09-23","keywords":"place name in title,city name in title,city in title,united states of america,usa","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000325/","name":"David Caruso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698346/","name":"Emily Procter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735226/","name":"Adam Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231929/","name":"Ann Donahue","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578856/","name":"Carol Mendelsohn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series.

In some cases they work, like Angel which has become a show of its own. On the other hand the Star Trek spin-offs (more so the later ones) have becoming mere clones of the show they have spawned from. It is difficult to make it work. You can try and be different and the fan base from the originating show could hate you. Be too similar and the counter effect it that many will call it nothing but a clone. While CSI:Miami is more or less the same show as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation it is still a series that is well worth watching and most of it is down to the reasons that the originating series was worth watching. Fantastic writing, feature film production values and a good cast. While in Crime Scene Investigation the casting is first class here were are merely in good territory. The cast here don't seem to share the same chemistry as Grissom and friends, although whether or  not this is deliberate I'm not sure.\n\nWith regards to casting what they do have in common is a superb central male lead. David Caruso is a fine actor, was so in the first season of NYPD Blue. Here he is incredible. Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for. In saying that the show is still worth watching and is perhaps the first step in what is looking like a growing franchise."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-09-23","keywords":"place name in title,city name in title,city in title,united states of america,usa","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000325/","name":"David Caruso"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698346/","name":"Emily Procter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735226/","name":"Adam Rodriguez"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231929/","name":"Ann Donahue"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578856/","name":"Carol Mendelsohn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for. In saying that the show is still worth watching and is perhaps the first step in what is looking like a growing franchise.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-09-23","keywords":"place name in title,city name in title,city in title,united states of america,usa","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000325/","name":"David Caruso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698346/","name":"Emily Procter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735226/","name":"Adam Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231929/","name":"Ann Donahue","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578856/","name":"Carol Mendelsohn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

You can try and be different and the fan base from the originating show could hate you. Be too similar and the counter effect it that many will call it nothing but a clone. While CSI:Miami is more or less the same show as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation it is still a series that is well worth watching and most of it is down to the reasons that the originating series was worth watching. Fantastic writing, feature film production values and a good cast. While in Crime Scene Investigation the casting is first class here were are merely in good territory.

David Caruso is a fine actor, was so in the first season of NYPD Blue. Here he is incredible. Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for.

In some cases they work, like Angel which has become a show of its own. On the other hand the Star Trek spin-offs (more so the later ones) have becoming mere clones of the show they have spawned from. It is difficult to make it work. You can try and be different and the fan base from the originating show could hate you. Be too similar and the counter effect it that many will call it nothing but a clone. While CSI:Miami is more or less the same show as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation it is still a series that is well worth watching and most of it is down to the reasons that the originating series was worth watching. Fantastic writing, feature film production values and a good cast. While in Crime Scene Investigation the casting is first class here were are merely in good territory. The cast here don't seem to share the same chemistry as Grissom and friends, although whether or  not this is deliberate I'm not sure.\n\nWith regards to casting what they do have in common is a superb central male lead. David Caruso is a fine actor, was so in the first season of NYPD Blue. Here he is incredible. Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for. In saying that the show is still worth watching and is perhaps the first step in what is looking like a growing franchise.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-09-23","keywords":"place name in title,city name in title,city in title,united states of america,usa","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000325/","name":"David Caruso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698346/","name":"Emily Procter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735226/","name":"Adam Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231929/","name":"Ann Donahue","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578856/","name":"Carol Mendelsohn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

If you have CBS All Access that can be understandable since they DON'T carry S1. For $10 bucks a month it should be available. Just watching S2 can get confusing if you haven't seen the much better Season One minus the "Most Wanted" episode. That episode was the Pilot for "FBI: Most Wanted" and not very good. The First Season of FBI was more suspenseful with better writing and plots. The same could be said for the characters. Where's Ian Lim been lately played by James Chen? A much better character than what looks like his replacement Kelly Moran played by Taylor Anthony Miller. Not a good replacement so far. Hopefully Chen comes back. A big loss for the show. Sela Ward as Dana Mosier was leaving after Season One no matter what. A huge loss. Her replacement Alana De La Garza as Isobel Castile has been a hit or miss affair. Horrible in S2 E1 "Little Egypt", better in every show after. Still no Dana though. John Boyd as Stuart Scola has been bringing S2 down. Why his "Barney Fife" character hasn't been written off the show is a better mystery than some of the S2 plots. His new partner Emily Ryder played by Catherine Haena Kim has been solid so far. She has a future in acting. Why Kristen Chazel (Ebonee Noel) was taken out of the field as Scola's partner is baffling. Maybe due to the absence of Iam at headquarters? S2 is not S1 yet. It's not bad either, though uneven. Viewers that don't watch or like FBI are going to give those One Star ratings that don't make sense. If it's a bonafide 1 Star show it would've been yanked off the air after 5 shows. For those folks, don't watch this show. If you watch more than 3 episodes such a low Star rating doesn't make sense. Anyway, I hope FBI gets back to the S1 caliber of writing and acting. After that "Most Wanted" episode in S1 I saw a giant Red Flag. "Little Egypt" S2's first episode was another flag. Hopefully they continue for the better. Maggie and OA got me interested in FBI from the start. The acting chemistry is there. Now give them the surrounding plots and characters that made S1 so good CBS. Put S1 on All Access too while you're at it!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14311,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He's an amazing actor and he heads up a cast of amazing actors as well.  This show really keeps you on the edge of your seat as the investigators literally take a crime scene that appears to leave them with nothing to go on.

In some cases they work, like Angel which has become a show of its own. On the other hand the Star Trek spin-offs (more so the later ones) have becoming mere clones of the show they have spawned from. It is difficult to make it work. You can try and be different and the fan base from the originating show could hate you. Be too similar and the counter effect it that many will call it nothing but a clone. While CSI:Miami is more or less the same show as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation it is still a series that is well worth watching and most of it is down to the reasons that the originating series was worth watching. Fantastic writing, feature film production values and a good cast. While in Crime Scene Investigation the casting is first class here were are merely in good territory. The cast here don't seem to share the same chemistry as Grissom and friends, although whether or  not this is deliberate I'm not sure.\n\nWith regards to casting what they do have in common is a superb central male lead. David Caruso is a fine actor, was so in the first season of NYPD Blue. Here he is incredible. Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for.

Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for. In saying that the show is still worth watching and is perhaps the first step in what is looking like a growing franchise.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-09-23","keywords":"place name in title,city name in title,city in title,united states of america,usa","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000325/","name":"David Caruso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698346/","name":"Emily Procter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735226/","name":"Adam Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231929/","name":"Ann Donahue","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578856/","name":"Carol Mendelsohn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

In some cases they work, like Angel which has become a show of its own. On the other hand the Star Trek spin-offs (more so the later ones) have becoming mere clones of the show they have spawned from. It is difficult to make it work. You can try and be different and the fan base from the originating show could hate you. Be too similar and the counter effect it that many will call it nothing but a clone. While CSI:Miami is more or less the same show as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation it is still a series that is well worth watching and most of it is down to the reasons that the originating series was worth watching. Fantastic writing, feature film production values and a good cast. While in Crime Scene Investigation the casting is first class here were are merely in good territory. The cast here don't seem to share the same chemistry as Grissom and friends, although whether or  not this is deliberate I'm not sure.\n\nWith regards to casting what they do have in common is a superb central male lead. David Caruso is a fine actor, was so in the first season of NYPD Blue. Here he is incredible. Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for.

While CSI:Miami is more or less the same show as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation it is still a series that is well worth watching and most of it is down to the reasons that the originating series was worth watching. Fantastic writing, feature film production values and a good cast. While in Crime Scene Investigation the casting is first class here were are merely in good territory. The cast here don't seem to share the same chemistry as Grissom and friends, although whether or  not this is deliberate I'm not sure.\n\nWith regards to casting what they do have in common is a superb central male lead. David Caruso is a fine actor, was so in the first season of NYPD Blue. Here he is incredible. Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for. In saying that the show is still worth watching and is perhaps the first step in what is looking like a growing franchise."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-09-23","keywords":"place name in title,city name in title,city in title,united states of america,usa","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000325/","name":"David Caruso"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698346/","name":"Emily Procter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735226/","name":"Adam Rodriguez"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231929/","name":"Ann Donahue"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578856/","name":"Carol Mendelsohn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

William L. Petersen is the coolest of the cool as Gil Grissom.  I've followed his career since I first saw him in To Live and Die in L.A.  He's an amazing actor and he heads up a cast of amazing actors as well.  This show really keeps you on the edge of your seat as the investigators literally take a crime scene that appears to leave them with nothing to go on.  The investigators take nothing and turn it into something amazing as each crime is solved right in front of you and you as the viewer, never see it coming!  Wow!  I hope this is one show CBS will pick up year after year!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":81434,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2000-10-06","keywords":"crime scene investigation,las vegas nevada,crime lab,police,detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000401/","name":"Laurence Fishburne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001339/","name":"Marg Helgenberger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0247040/","name":"George Eads"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

In some cases they work, like Angel which has become a show of its own.

You can try and be different and the fan base from the originating show could hate you. Be too similar and the counter effect it that many will call it nothing but a clone. While CSI:Miami is more or less the same show as CSI:Crime Scene Investigation it is still a series that is well worth watching and most of it is down to the reasons that the originating series was worth watching. Fantastic writing, feature film production values and a good cast. While in Crime Scene Investigation the casting is first class here were are merely in good territory. The cast here don't seem to share the same chemistry as Grissom and friends, although whether or  not this is deliberate I'm not sure.\n\nWith regards to casting what they do have in common is a superb central male lead. David Caruso is a fine actor, was so in the first season of NYPD Blue. Here he is incredible. Unlike Grissom, Horatio Crane (the best name ever for the main character in a television show) is more speculative, he will be more open to hunches than just considering the evidence. The manner in which is delivers his dialog is controlled mannered. If Grissom is the Fox Mulder of CSI, then Crane is undoubtedly the Frank Black. The supporting actors themselves are very good. Kim Delaney was watchable if a little too glossy while former West Wing actress Emily Procter once again brings a wealth of quirky charm that she likewise did with Ainsley in the White House drama.\n\nOf course the biggest change here is the location. Instead of the bright lights of Las Vegas we have the sun shine of Miami. Ironically whereas Crime Scene Investigation would be predominantly set during night time, Miami is set more in the day light hours and with it comes a higher level of violence. In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for.

In Ireland the channel that broadcasts the show frequently put out a warning before hand, something that never befalls the originating series. What we get here are episodes involving body parts falling of out dead sharks, scenes of autopsies that are more graphic and stories that are slightly more darker (the show itself is broadcast at 10pm in America).\n\nWhile the show is no Angel it isn't Star Trek:Voyager either. It is hugely entertaining and the stories are frequently entertaining and well produced. What it lacks though is the warmness of the Las Vegas team. Horatio, in the same way as Frank Black, is less emotional and more controlled over his thoughts, whereas the Las Vegas equivalent would be putting heart and soul into the cases they were fighting for. In saying that the show is still worth watching and is perhaps the first step in what is looking like a growing franchise.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-09-23","keywords":"place name in title,city name in title,city in title,united states of america,usa","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000325/","name":"David Caruso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698346/","name":"Emily Procter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735226/","name":"Adam Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231929/","name":"Ann Donahue","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578856/","name":"Carol Mendelsohn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

The plot lines are an interesting blend of soap opera, drama, and comedy--it's not really like anything else, but at the same time, it occasionally feels pedestrian. However, it's very well done--good writing, great acting, and well directed. \n\nSandra Oh stands out for her comic timing, but the entire cast is superb. It's not as grave as ER, but is just as compelling. Also, it's a little more accessible than ER and some of the more serious medical dramas. The show is definitely worth catching--if you can't watch it when it airs, TiVo it or rent the first season DVD. It's well worth the time spent! It's great for marathon viewings!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":281866,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2005-03-27","keywords":"surgeon,hospital,lesbian,work romance,surgery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0690186/","name":"Ellen Pompeo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933156/","name":"Chandra Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681782/","name":"James Pickens Jr."],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170849/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085751/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067205/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722274/","name":"Shonda Rhimes"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 12 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi17412889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NjQyOTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5NTY4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Season 12 of Grey's Anatomy from ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="
