The director is a young woman Hafsia Herzi and it seems to be her first feature film after a short. She is also the main performer and has a rich experience as an actress. So I guess she didn't learn the job with theory and technical lessons but on the sets. It may explain her freedom and her sensibility, the way her camera loves her characters is truly moving, finding every time the right distance. A beautiful montage allows her to express in a very precise way, what she wants to tell about her characters. The subject is very thin, a young woman doesn't succeed in renouncing to a man that doesn't deserve her and cheats on her, and she deserves a love that she doesn't succeed in finding. I won't tell the end that doesn't much matter any way. Dialogues are excellent and funny. No morality preach about racism or intolerance for homosexuality; in fact no preach at all, but great portrayal of characters who try to find their way to happiness and love.

I thought it would be just another well-acted period drama. What I didn't know was that Todd Haynes was behind it, and from the opening the film lets you know what kind of style it will be. It's not one of those stuffy period dramas. In fact, it's very much made in the style of actual 1950s films.

I thought it would be just another well-acted period drama. What I didn't know was that Todd Haynes was behind it, and from the opening the film lets you know what kind of style it will be. It's not one of those stuffy period dramas. In fact, it's very much made in the style of actual 1950s films. It's apparently taking on the style of Douglas Sirks' films, and even though I have never seen one, the style is apparent. \n\nThis is the definition of a melodrama, but it serves the purpose completely and not the type of melodrama you would expect in this day and age.

How would anyone know that it was hidden behind a painting?  Well that, and most of the other details of this film, is never explained.  For example, why would an art museum be loaded up with 55-gallon drums of gasoline, so that when it is torched as a diversion to stealing the painting, they could explode like rockets?  And for that matter, with all the exploding and flames everywhere, the painting should have been burnt to a crisp before anyone had a chance to swipe it.

Never mind that one is a cop and another a government agent, sworn to an oath to serve the public, and hence any treasure they might discover as a result of doing their jobs would more correctly belong to the people they serve.  In other words, the basic message of this film is that serving the public might be fine in theory, but when the potential for feathering one's nest with a vast fortune gets involved, best to take the money and run.  No wonder the current generation has so little faith in public servants.  When they go to the movies, they see them portrayed as only marginally less greedy than the crooks.\n\nThis is a shameful story, which promotes the view that no matter how you end up with the loot, it is yours to keep and enjoy.  The bad guys, who want to keep it all for themselves, must first be knocked out of course, after which the `good' guys get to divide the hoard.  And the reason why they are `different' from the crooks is because they are less `violently' motivated by greed.  In other words, if avarice is pursued less violently, perhaps more humanely, then it's okay.  In any case, what matters is that you end up with the prize.

Stir Of Echoes was not it. Partly due to the studio's financial difficulties, Stir Of Echoes came and went by itself, unsung and unappreciated. Which goes to show that recognition in the Hollywood system does not go to innovators or the best storytellers. It is all about marketability, and while Stir Of Echoes had this, the companies involved in making or distributing it did not seem to want to spend the cash involved in taking advantage. Either that or Artisan and Fox decided to use it as their tax write-off for that year.\n\nI have not read the novel by Richard Matheson, so I cannot comment on how faithfully the film follows its source. But that is irrelevant. When compared to its more big-name competitor, at least Stir Of Echoes has the courtesy to acknowledge its source. The film updates the story to a more modern era, thus saving a few dollars, since period pieces are expensive to make. In fact, the dramatic angle of the film keeps it rather cheap, since effects shots are few and far between. Not to mention the effects that do appear are fairly simple in nature. Indeed, Stir Of Echoes only cost about thirteen million to make, according to estimates. Which makes it all the more peculiar that Fox was unwilling to invest a little more effort in publicising the film.\n\nKevin Bacon is in fine, fine form as the film's central hero, a regular guy called Tom Witzky. Kathryn Erbe is also in great form as his wife, Maggie. Illeana Douglas is decidedly odd as his sister-in-law, Lisa. But the real surprise here is child performer Zachary David Cope.

If nothing else, it is worth watching to see a small ensemble cast that excels. Even small performances like Liza Weil's demonstrate a sense of dramatic flair that has long fled most of the rest of Hollywood. It is for this reason that I gave Stir Of Echoes an eight out of ten. It is worth watching just to see how badly misdirected the hype machine often is.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":79328,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1999-09-10","keywords":"hypnosis,seeing a ghost,missing person,psychic power,haunted house","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stir of Echoes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1653276953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAyMjM3ODEtYzA4Yi00NGM0LWI5YzctYWYwNTIxMDg5YWEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAyMjM3ODEtYzA4Yi00NGM0LWI5YzctYWYwNTIxMDg5YWEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000102/","name":"Kevin Bacon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0178574/","name":"Zachary David Cope"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002062/","name":"Kathryn Erbe"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014903/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558577/","name":"Richard Matheson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After being hypnotized by his sister-in-law, a man begins seeing haunting visions of a girl's ghost and a mystery begins to unfold around him." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0164181/","name":"Stir of Echoes","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2NTEwZWYtYzcxYi00MzZhLTg0NDMtNTBhMTM3MjEyMmU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTI4MjkwNjA@._V1_.jpg","description":"After being hypnotized by his sister-in-law, a man begins seeing haunting visions of a girl's ghost and a mystery begins to unfold around him.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0164181/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"mentalcritic","dateCreated":"2000-11-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"Horribly underrated","reviewBody":"In 1999, the media was in a frenzy about a new film that used real things to terrify and excite its audience. Stir Of Echoes was not it. Partly due to the studio's financial difficulties, Stir Of Echoes came and went by itself, unsung and unappreciated. Which goes to show that recognition in the Hollywood system does not go to innovators or the best storytellers. It is all about marketability, and while Stir Of Echoes had this, the companies involved in making or distributing it did not seem to want to spend the cash involved in taking advantage. Either that or Artisan and Fox decided to use it as their tax write-off for that year.\n\nI have not read the novel by Richard Matheson, so I cannot comment on how faithfully the film follows its source. But that is irrelevant. When compared to its more big-name competitor, at least Stir Of Echoes has the courtesy to acknowledge its source. The film updates the story to a more modern era, thus saving a few dollars, since period pieces are expensive to make. In fact, the dramatic angle of the film keeps it rather cheap, since effects shots are few and far between. Not to mention the effects that do appear are fairly simple in nature. Indeed, Stir Of Echoes only cost about thirteen million to make, according to estimates. Which makes it all the more peculiar that Fox was unwilling to invest a little more effort in publicising the film.\n\nKevin Bacon is in fine, fine form as the film's central hero, a regular guy called Tom Witzky. Kathryn Erbe is also in great form as his wife, Maggie. Illeana Douglas is decidedly odd as his sister-in-law, Lisa. But the real surprise here is child performer Zachary David Cope. After the pretender, that pile of sachaarine garbage called The Sixth Sense, child stars had such a bad reputation that Zachary deserves a medal for portraying such a genuinely likable, layered character. Indeed, director David Koepp took one hell of a risk by placing so much of the responsibility for the plot on his shoulders. That it pays off is a testament not only to the strength of Zachary David Cope's performance, but to the strength of the material he was given. Indeed, all the best scenes in Stir Of Echoes involve interaction between Zachary, Kathryn, and Kevin.\n\nI do think this film has its faults. Chief among them is that the story needed another ten minutes to properly develop. Plot threads like the group of psychics, a member of which helps put Kathryn Erbe's character on the path of greater understanding, needed better resolution. One moment, Maggie is asking this policeman why her husband is obsessed with a scene of memories to the exclusion of his job. The next moment, not only are details like the job forgotten, so too is the group and the policeman.

For this one is a real winner between the two, despite of the variance in genre.\n\nKate (Poesy) and Justin (Moore) are a sweet preggers couple living in peace in the upper part of a duplex apartment. The newest renters of the lower part are another sweet but superstitious couple from Germany, Theresa (Birn) and Jon (Morrissey), also expecting a child. Soon after they move in. an emotionally devastating incident brings endless grief to the ones below and paranoia to their luckier neighbors above, especially to Kate. Because Kate thinks that Theresa and Jon might have some ulterior motive. And then the plot starts moving swiftly, exhibiting some great cinematography and writing as it moves.\n\nPoesy is excellent in her enactment of an anxious mother of a newborn. Her petite appearance helps and so does the support from her spouse who is a rather normal husband torn between work and personal life. Theresa and Jon steal the limelight, and the writer aptly denotes and connects them with the color yellow that is effervescent of their apparent darker side. \n\nThe story involves human nature and the extent to which it can go when stricken with sorrow. Consequences and damages stop being concerns as the person quests to achieve what is not rationally right and what can only be achieved through crime. Farr has written the story well, and with the backing that he gets from the camera and score, he definitely places his attempt in the good baskets.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: David Farr's The Ones Below is a finely made film with some good actors playing natural and slightly eccentric characters who are just trying to manage life... and death. A good afternoon watch at the cinema.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family?

For this one is a real winner between the two, despite of the variance in genre.\n\nKate (Poesy) and Justin (Moore) are a sweet preggers couple living in peace in the upper part of a duplex apartment. The newest renters of the lower part are another sweet but superstitious couple from Germany, Theresa (Birn) and Jon (Morrissey), also expecting a child. Soon after they move in. an emotionally devastating incident brings endless grief to the ones below and paranoia to their luckier neighbors above, especially to Kate. Because Kate thinks that Theresa and Jon might have some ulterior motive. And then the plot starts moving swiftly, exhibiting some great cinematography and writing as it moves.\n\nPoesy is excellent in her enactment of an anxious mother of a newborn. Her petite appearance helps and so does the support from her spouse who is a rather normal husband torn between work and personal life. Theresa and Jon steal the limelight, and the writer aptly denotes and connects them with the color yellow that is effervescent of their apparent darker side. \n\nThe story involves human nature and the extent to which it can go when stricken with sorrow. Consequences and damages stop being concerns as the person quests to achieve what is not rationally right and what can only be achieved through crime. Farr has written the story well, and with the backing that he gets from the camera and score, he definitely places his attempt in the good baskets.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: David Farr's The Ones Below is a finely made film with some good actors playing natural and slightly eccentric characters who are just trying to manage life... and death. A good afternoon watch at the cinema.\n\nCan be watched with a typical Indian family? YES","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10006,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2016-03-11","keywords":"london england,baby,husband wife relationship,cat,drowning in a bathtub","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi901952537","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3NTA2ODgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5OTM5ODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc3NTA2ODgzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI5OTM5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A couple expecting their first child discover an an unnerving difference between themselves and the couple living in the flat below them who are also having a baby.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0993242/","name":"Clémence Poésy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0607375/","name":"David Morrissey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1304386/","name":"Stephen Campbell Moore"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016333/","name":"David Farr"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177712/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1016333/","name":"David Farr"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I thought it would be just another well-acted period drama. What I didn't know was that Todd Haynes was behind it, and from the opening the film lets you know what kind of style it will be. It's not one of those stuffy period dramas. In fact, it's very much made in the style of actual 1950s films. It's apparently taking on the style of Douglas Sirks' films, and even though I have never seen one, the style is apparent. \n\nThis is the definition of a melodrama, but it serves the purpose completely and not the type of melodrama you would expect in this day and age. Everything is heightened in it's intensity. The incredible cinematography and use of colors is something to marvel at, and in terms of how the cinematography was constructed I don't think any other film could compare to. The beautiful music score is perfect and it only makes the atmosphere richer. All of this serves as a backdrop to a film that's really about contemporary issues in the 50s. That in itself has been the focus of many films in the last few years, but Far From Heaven stands apart from them all. The screenplay is brilliantly written, infusing rich backgrounds and characterization to all of the characters. In fact, the plot is pretty straight-forward and something you would see in classic films of that era, but now it feels fresh, alive with excitement. It's never depressing, and instead it tells its story until a satisfying conclusion. It's probably one of the best screenplays of its decade.\n\nThe performances are also perfect. But Julianne Moore tops off this perfection. I was surprised by how little "big" scenes she has. I would have expected this film to, but then again that's just another surprise. She embodies this character completely, and now that we have all of these flawed and unlikable leads, here we have one who we can easily call a "hero". Someone who others could look up to, we instantly connect with Moore. \n\nOverall, Far From Heaven is the 2nd Haynes film I have seen (the other being I'm Not There), and still his ambition is as apparent as ever.

How would anyone know that it was hidden behind a painting?  Well that, and most of the other details of this film, is never explained.

And the reason why they are `different' from the crooks is because they are less `violently' motivated by greed.  In other words, if avarice is pursued less violently, perhaps more humanely, then it's okay.  In any case, what matters is that you end up with the prize.

I would call this a Sunday afternoon film, it does all the thinking for you but you can still enjoy the ride.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21974,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-10","keywords":"philosophy,gay character,voting,group decision making,teacher","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"After the Dark","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2278733849","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWEyZGU0YTktYTIyZC00Mzk1LWJiZDctZDc0NzA4Njg3NDM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWEyZGU0YTktYTIyZC00Mzk1LWJiZDctZDc0NzA4Njg3NDM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for After the Dark","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0195439/","name":"James D'Arcy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2998321/","name":"Sophie Lowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0754512/","name":"Daryl Sabara"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0399655/","name":"John Huddles"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0308344/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129628/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0518649/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0399655/","name":"John Huddles"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I love horror/comedies and this one looked very promising, funny premise, great cast, and zombies (who doesn't love zombies?). It wasn't a bad movie by any means but it did let me down a little bit.\n\nFirst off the main thing that killed my buzz with this was how unlikable Elijah Wood's character was, I get that they were doing this on purpose but the scenes with him in them just made me get more and more irritated with his character. It's not that Wood did a bad job or anything, it's just that some of the lines that were written for his character were almost cringe worthy bad. That character however was more than made up for by how awesome Rainn Wilson's character was, some of his lines were gold.\n\nA lot of the jokes were great, I found myself laughing out loud multiple times, but some of them just fell short and didn't really work at all. For the most part though the humor works well and helps to move along the movie. I think the main thing that really kept this movie from being great is that the Horror concept of it kind of gets put on the back burner to the comedy in too many scenes. I really wish they would have thrown more horror elements in. There are far too many scenes of the survivors just sitting in various rooms of the school trading mediocre-pretty decent dialogue.\n\nOverall this wasn't bad, in fact it was a good movie. I was entertained and had a fun time watching it. But it could have used a bit more gore and horror and a little less mediocre jokes. Still a good ride though.\n\n6.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25138,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2015-09-18","keywords":"cannibalism,child burning,co worker co worker relationship,school,colleague colleague relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1659678745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA3MjE1MzU5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTIwNDY3NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA3MjE1MzU5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTIwNDY3NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A mysterious virus hits an isolated elementary school, transforming the kids into a feral swarm of mass savages.

I love horror/comedies and this one looked very promising, funny premise, great cast, and zombies (who doesn't love zombies?). It wasn't a bad movie by any means but it did let me down a little bit.\n\nFirst off the main thing that killed my buzz with this was how unlikable Elijah Wood's character was, I get that they were doing this on purpose but the scenes with him in them just made me get more and more irritated with his character. It's not that Wood did a bad job or anything, it's just that some of the lines that were written for his character were almost cringe worthy bad. That character however was more than made up for by how awesome Rainn Wilson's character was, some of his lines were gold.\n\nA lot of the jokes were great, I found myself laughing out loud multiple times, but some of them just fell short and didn't really work at all. For the most part though the humor works well and helps to move along the movie. I think the main thing that really kept this movie from being great is that the Horror concept of it kind of gets put on the back burner to the comedy in too many scenes. I really wish they would have thrown more horror elements in. There are far too many scenes of the survivors just sitting in various rooms of the school trading mediocre-pretty decent dialogue.\n\nOverall this wasn't bad, in fact it was a good movie. I was entertained and had a fun time watching it. But it could have used a bit more gore and horror and a little less mediocre jokes. Still a good ride though.\n\n6.5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25138,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2015-09-18","keywords":"cannibalism,child burning,co worker co worker relationship,school,colleague colleague relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1659678745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA3MjE1MzU5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTIwNDY3NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODA3MjE1MzU5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTIwNDY3NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A mysterious virus hits an isolated elementary school, transforming the kids into a feral swarm of mass savages.

The script is horribly written and makes no account for the low budget it is and tries to be too clever for its own good. Sadly too, Snipes has fallen into the trap of having an ADR voice double doing much of his dialogue, and an entire narration that comes every now and again through points in the movie. It's sad to see a guy of Wesley Snipes talent doing garbage like this film, and producing a tired and clearly bored performance, barely bothered to produce his own dialogue. It's become somewhat of a joke with Steven Seagal, the fact he doesn't perform his own dialogue, but it's not something I'd have expected from Snipes. Perhaps it's due to the producer, Andrew Stevens who has worked with Seagal previously, or the director Po-Chi Leong, responsible for Seagal's epically bad Out Of Reach.\n\nThe plot involves shady government officials, terrorists who coach soccer teams, disks with incriminating evidence on and a hefty chuck of missing money. Oh and biological weapons. Now how they are connected I don't know but what I can tell you is the diabolical script is pretty hard to fathom and like many of these DTV movies, this likes to include one twist too many. The plot is also uninterestingly told, playing out it's cards with people having shady one to ones in offices and dark alleys etc. It's all kind of "lets have a sit down and dish out some plot points for the sad bastards watching this film!" The pace of the movie as such suffers because despite the dullness of the performances and the storyline, the film does have some nice action scenes. As an example of how a DTV film has successfully put across a storyline of a twisting nature, I give you Dolph Lundgren's directorial debut, the Defender. That movie had it's share of twists and over complexity but the movie has a last hour of almost entirely action, with Dolph under siege form terrorists. The plot points are told in the context of action, on the move, while avoiding death. The movie doesn't stop to tell us what's happening, it doesn't break up the pace. As such although the plot was a little convoluted, it was more forgivable cause the action never let up. The Detonator like too many of these films, stops everything to give us a convoluted walk through of who's bad, and who isn't, before inevitably shifting that round in the pulled from the rear end twist at the end. These movies can often suffer with pacing issues.\n\nSnipes himself as I mentioned is pretty bland here. At the beginning he's putting on a camp persona as he's undercover with some arms dealers. Initially it seemed as if he was enjoying himself but unfortunately the rest of the movie sees him and his occasional voice double sleepwalking through the role. Snipes only comes alive when he's called upon to kick ass. There's some nice action here though, with some swift and crunching martial arts and some nicely punchy shootouts. The film also features a decent car chase. Silvia Colloca co-star and she's not much of an actress, but she is gorgeous, with a costume that screams "look at my cleavage!" The rest of the cast flit in and out with clichéd and uninteresting roles.\n\nSnipes thankfully has better projects lined up from now. He has another team up with Mario Van Peebles, called Hard Luck, then he will do Chasing The Dragon, from the director Chris Nahon, who did Jet Li's Kiss Of The Dragon. Finally Snipes is apparently doing Toussaint, a biographical drama, directed by Danny Glover. The future is suddenly looking brighter for Snipes, but lets remember he was getting extremely well paid for his DTV films, around $7million a movie, possibly more. It's also funny to consider that of all these DTV god's Dolph Lundgren is doing the better films, directing himself, with the enjoyable Defender and the supremely violent and nicely done The Russian Specialist, and what's more he's doing them on a fraction of the budgets of these diabolical offerings from Wesley and Steven Seagal are producing. *1/2","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4298,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-04-25","keywords":"driving a car,driving,car,automobile,convertible","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Detonator aka.

But, that is not why we go to movies anyway, is it? That is like going to see Godzilla expecting to learn something about giant lizards that vomit radioactive spray. Emmerich has taken a fictitious subject he knew would be controversial and woven some drama into it. People who tend to be slightly paranoid will no doubt be even more so after seeing the world destroyed according to interpretations of prophecy. The people who sell the books promoting the fear make money, just like the movie producers. So what? I didn't see this movie to pick up any information I haven't learned from the History Channel, nor do I believe any more than I did before, that anything bad is going to happen on December 21, 2012. Did I go expecting to be highly entertained by great CGI and action? Yes! And I wasn't disappointed! One thing many reviewers haven't been picking up on while watching this movie is the very slight tongue-in-cheekiness of the subject that Emmerich cleverly wove into the plot. He obviously doesn't believe any of the prophecy any more than most of the rest of us do. You can see it in the actors' performances too: Woody Harrelson, to wit. It is the same as a weatherman who can deliver his forecast each night without laughing because he truly doesn't know with certainty what is going to happen, but he tries to make us believe nonetheless.\n\nSee this movie if you love cinema. Enjoy the things about cinema that make it great. Take a small pillow for your butt cheeks because almost 3 hours of sitting in an uncomfortable theater seat will make you wish you had. But fear not. There is so much non-stop action you won't notice the discomfort too much.\n\nThe film has obvious flaws, trite clichés, and phony science, but if you are a fan of 50's sci-fi, you will love this movie. And remember, don't take it too seriously folks, just enjoy it. The end of the world isn't going to happen in 2012, there really aren't any giant grasshoppers, ants, or lizards roaming the Earth, and no one's career is going to end because of their role in this movie. It is Hollywood having a good time with a controversial subject. Nothing new there.\n\nEnjoy the show!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":365682,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-11-11","keywords":"apocalypse,earthquake,end of the world,elizabeth i character,juvenile bedwetting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"2012: Final Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3444113945","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NDQ4MjE5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgzMDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NDQ4MjE5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgzMDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An academic researcher leads a group of people in a fight to counteract the apocalyptic events that were predicted by the ancient Mayan calendar.

 --- Description: 2012: Directed by Roland Emmerich. With John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Thandiwe Newton. A frustrated writer struggles to keep his family alive when a series of global catastrophes threatens to annihilate mankind." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1190080/","name":"2012","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MjEyODQzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTczMjQ4Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A frustrated writer struggles to keep his family alive when a series of global catastrophes threatens to annihilate mankind.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1190080/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"polombob","dateCreated":"2009-11-15","inLanguage":"English","name":"It's the end of the world, not anybody's career","reviewBody":"Anybody going to this movie to learn about the Mayan prophecies for 2012 or for any true science, is going to be sadly disappointed. But, that is not why we go to movies anyway, is it? That is like going to see Godzilla expecting to learn something about giant lizards that vomit radioactive spray. Emmerich has taken a fictitious subject he knew would be controversial and woven some drama into it. People who tend to be slightly paranoid will no doubt be even more so after seeing the world destroyed according to interpretations of prophecy. The people who sell the books promoting the fear make money, just like the movie producers. So what? I didn't see this movie to pick up any information I haven't learned from the History Channel, nor do I believe any more than I did before, that anything bad is going to happen on December 21, 2012. Did I go expecting to be highly entertained by great CGI and action? Yes! And I wasn't disappointed! One thing many reviewers haven't been picking up on while watching this movie is the very slight tongue-in-cheekiness of the subject that Emmerich cleverly wove into the plot. He obviously doesn't believe any of the prophecy any more than most of the rest of us do. You can see it in the actors' performances too: Woody Harrelson, to wit. It is the same as a weatherman who can deliver his forecast each night without laughing because he truly doesn't know with certainty what is going to happen, but he tries to make us believe nonetheless.\n\nSee this movie if you love cinema. Enjoy the things about cinema that make it great. Take a small pillow for your butt cheeks because almost 3 hours of sitting in an uncomfortable theater seat will make you wish you had. But fear not. There is so much non-stop action you won't notice the discomfort too much.\n\nThe film has obvious flaws, trite clichés, and phony science, but if you are a fan of 50's sci-fi, you will love this movie. And remember, don't take it too seriously folks, just enjoy it. The end of the world isn't going to happen in 2012, there really aren't any giant grasshoppers, ants, or lizards roaming the Earth, and no one's career is going to end because of their role in this movie. It is Hollywood having a good time with a controversial subject. Nothing new there.\n\nEnjoy the show!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":365682,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-11-11","keywords":"apocalypse,earthquake,end of the world,elizabeth i character,juvenile bedwetting","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"2012: Final Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3444113945","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NDQ4MjE5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgzMDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NDQ4MjE5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgzMDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An academic researcher leads a group of people in a fight to counteract the apocalyptic events that were predicted by the ancient Mayan calendar.

It's a tried and true story for the post-apocalyptic genre and doesn't do anything really cool with it except for the title. The title of the film plays into the "twist" in the film, if you can even call it that and it's about the only thing that it does a little differently.\n\nNothing too bad on the acting side. There's no Oscar winning performances but everybody does a decent job with the crap dialogue they are given. Except the kid... He just stares all the time, looking dumbfounded. Must have been a way to keep people from calling him "The annoying kid." \n\nThe film looks good in it's presentation. The choreography in the fight scenes is a bit exaggerated but I enjoyed that. What is does so wrong is the absolute straight 'teen angst novel' scenes and relationships. The books suffered from this too and I feel it could have been made to be a bit more serious to kind of adult up the series and make it fit with a wider audience.\n\nOverall it is a bad adaption of an average book.

It's a tried and true story for the post-apocalyptic genre and doesn't do anything really cool with it except for the title. The title of the film plays into the "twist" in the film, if you can even call it that and it's about the only thing that it does a little differently.\n\nNothing too bad on the acting side. There's no Oscar winning performances but everybody does a decent job with the crap dialogue they are given. Except the kid... He just stares all the time, looking dumbfounded. Must have been a way to keep people from calling him "The annoying kid." \n\nThe film looks good in it's presentation. The choreography in the fight scenes is a bit exaggerated but I enjoyed that. What is does so wrong is the absolute straight 'teen angst novel' scenes and relationships. The books suffered from this too and I feel it could have been made to be a bit more serious to kind of adult up the series and make it fit with a wider audience.\n\nOverall it is a bad adaption of an average book. It alienates everyone over the age of 12 by making it way too much like the novel and not trying to change up some of the things it needed to.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":105295,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-01-22","keywords":"alien,based on novel,male objectification,invasion,kiss","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3726226201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExOTczODM3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyOTA4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExOTczODM3N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyOTA4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four waves of increasingly deadly attacks have left most of Earth decimated.

Cale (Channing Tatum) is there with his 11 year old daughter Emily (Joey King). Through circumstances Cale saves President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) from being killed and they try to figure a way to beat the terrorists and save the White House.\n\nThis starts out badly. The first half hour deals with character development. Nothing wrong with that--but it's so DULL! Then the action starts up and it picks up. There's plenty of violence--LOTS of shootings but no blood (hence the PG-13 rating). Still it isn't that good. The action is strong and violent but not enough to carry the movie. Also it's far too long and gets stupider as it goes along. Seriously--by the end I was getting insulted as how moronic the film was getting. Also Emily (an 11 year old) is slapped around, threatened and (more than once) has a gun held to her head! That's going too far. Even worse is Tatum's acting. He was blank-faced throughout. On the plus side the special effects were great, Foxx was good as the president, and Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Woods were great in supporting roles. So it was loud and violent but too long and too stupid.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":214451,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"white house,automatic weapon,attempted coup d'etat,stabbed with a pen,beaten to death","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1969202713","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MzE3NjM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM3NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MzE3NjM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM3NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"While on a tour of the White House with his young daughter, a Capitol policeman springs into action to save his child and protect the president from a heavily armed group of paramilitary invaders."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350454/","name":"Maggie Gyllenhaal"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0321082/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Cale (Channing Tatum) is there with his 11 year old daughter Emily (Joey King). Through circumstances Cale saves President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) from being killed and they try to figure a way to beat the terrorists and save the White House.\n\nThis starts out badly. The first half hour deals with character development. Nothing wrong with that--but it's so DULL! Then the action starts up and it picks up. There's plenty of violence--LOTS of shootings but no blood (hence the PG-13 rating). Still it isn't that good. The action is strong and violent but not enough to carry the movie. Also it's far too long and gets stupider as it goes along. Seriously--by the end I was getting insulted as how moronic the film was getting. Also Emily (an 11 year old) is slapped around, threatened and (more than once) has a gun held to her head! That's going too far. Even worse is Tatum's acting. He was blank-faced throughout. On the plus side the special effects were great, Foxx was good as the president, and Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Woods were great in supporting roles. So it was loud and violent but too long and too stupid.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":214451,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"white house,automatic weapon,attempted coup d'etat,stabbed with a pen,beaten to death","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1969202713","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MzE3NjM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM3NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MzE3NjM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM3NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"While on a tour of the White House with his young daughter, a Capitol policeman springs into action to save his child and protect the president from a heavily armed group of paramilitary invaders.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350454/","name":"Maggie Gyllenhaal"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0321082/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

While some click, most of them crumble under the pressure to shake off the barrage of comparisons that would be thrown at the movie. Last couple of years saw such horrible reboots like Jurassic World, The Mummy, Kong: Skull Island. But much like Spiderman: Homecoming, Jumanji succeeds to impress the viewers.  Jumanji gets a modern age makeover where now instead of a board game it is a video game. Four teenagers with varying personalities are put together in a detention. Here they discover the Jumanji video game and enter the world of Jumanji as their avatars. Then starts the fun ride. There are enough plot holes like how did the video game end up in a high school from Alex's freak house. The movie uses time tested cliche - Four teenagers with some flaw realize their shortcomings when (literally) seen from some other's point of view. But the fun parts of the movie makes us forget them, at least till the movie ends.\n\nThe movie does not take itself seriously, and that is a huge plus point. The plot of the movie is crazy, there are man eating albino (what?!) rhinos on one side and villainous henchmen with crazy mud racing bike skills on the other side. But such craziness has been ridiculed in the movie itself, which makes you fall in love with it more.\n\nThe bigger plus for the movie has been the performance of the lead actors. All of them have created niche for themselves in the film industry. Jumanji has used such niche beautifully and built very funny characters. Parts where Dwayne Johnson(Spencer) stops to admire his own physique will have you in splits. Not to mention his hilarious display of 'smoldering intensity'. Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart and Jack Blake as a women in a man's body is perfect. Karen Gillan, who is this mean Nebula in MCU, comes up with a very charming performance.\n\nAll in all, Jumanji is a movie that you can watch without any regret. It will make you gasp, wonder and laugh hysterically. It is definitely worth a watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":348689,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-12-20","keywords":"jungle,trapped in a game,title based on song,song in title,high school","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3413817625","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four teenagers discover an old video game console and are literally drawn into the game's jungle setting becoming the adult avatars they choose."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2394794/","name":"Karen Gillan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366389/","name":"Kevin Hart"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440458/","name":"Jake Kasdan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332017/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003298/","name":"Scott Rosenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While some click, most of them crumble under the pressure to shake off the barrage of comparisons that would be thrown at the movie. Last couple of years saw such horrible reboots like Jurassic World, The Mummy, Kong: Skull Island. But much like Spiderman: Homecoming, Jumanji succeeds to impress the viewers.  Jumanji gets a modern age makeover where now instead of a board game it is a video game. Four teenagers with varying personalities are put together in a detention. Here they discover the Jumanji video game and enter the world of Jumanji as their avatars. Then starts the fun ride. There are enough plot holes like how did the video game end up in a high school from Alex's freak house. The movie uses time tested cliche - Four teenagers with some flaw realize their shortcomings when (literally) seen from some other's point of view. But the fun parts of the movie makes us forget them, at least till the movie ends.\n\nThe movie does not take itself seriously, and that is a huge plus point. The plot of the movie is crazy, there are man eating albino (what?!) rhinos on one side and villainous henchmen with crazy mud racing bike skills on the other side. But such craziness has been ridiculed in the movie itself, which makes you fall in love with it more.\n\nThe bigger plus for the movie has been the performance of the lead actors. All of them have created niche for themselves in the film industry. Jumanji has used such niche beautifully and built very funny characters. Parts where Dwayne Johnson(Spencer) stops to admire his own physique will have you in splits. Not to mention his hilarious display of 'smoldering intensity'. Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart and Jack Blake as a women in a man's body is perfect. Karen Gillan, who is this mean Nebula in MCU, comes up with a very charming performance.\n\nAll in all, Jumanji is a movie that you can watch without any regret. It will make you gasp, wonder and laugh hysterically. It is definitely worth a watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":348689,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-12-20","keywords":"jungle,trapped in a game,title based on song,song in title,high school","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3413817625","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four teenagers discover an old video game console and are literally drawn into the game's jungle setting becoming the adult avatars they choose.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2394794/","name":"Karen Gillan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366389/","name":"Kevin Hart"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440458/","name":"Jake Kasdan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332017/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003298/","name":"Scott Rosenberg"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

    <title lang="pl">Zieja</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Zieja: Directed by Robert Glinski. With Andrzej Seweryn, Mateusz Wieclawek, Zbigniew Zamachowski, Slawomir Orzechowski. The 70s. A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 10136434, Title: Zieja, 
 --- Description: Zieja: Directed by Robert Glinski. With Andrzej Seweryn, Mateusz Wieclawek, Zbigniew Zamachowski, Slawomir Orzechowski. The 70s. A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed.

I have neither seen the first one nor read the book, but this version of "Human Capital", mainly being carried on the shoulders of a great cast, is an effortful suburban tale of what happens when people get pushed to their limits, mental, physical and financial alike, a tale that sometimes hits and misses.\n\n"Human Capital" is a character-driven drama structured in retrospective kind of way, putting a single event in the center of it and then telling each character's journey and role in said event. This story-telling works well for the first hour, but as it progresses it also gets slower, leading into a silent and unsatisfying climax which in retrospect makes "Human Capital" feel more like a build-up in its entirety. The story and themes from which it's weaved from is realistic, relevant and tries to touch your strings, but does so unsurely. Financial hardships, father/daughter and husband/wife relationship problems, depression, suicide, sexual freedom - all of these themes are there on some level, but they don't connect together as well as they should've. It is the acting work by the well put together cast that makes up for some flaws, even the smaller roles are filled in with familiar faces and commendable performances. In my opinion, the brightest highlight shines on Live Schreiber and Maya Hawke. Visually it's quite obvious that "Human Capital" is made on a limiting budget and seems like most of it went to the cast (well deserved, good choice), so visually it has come out a standard indie drama/thriller flick, with no extraordinary solutions or distinctive characteristics.\n\n"Human Capital" is not a bad movie but neither is it memorable, it engages as a character-driven with enjoyable performances drama but has a knack to eventually underwhelm in most of the other areas. Recommended to those who are intrigued by its cast. My rating: 6/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9258,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-03-20","keywords":"children","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Human Capital","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2576727577","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU3MGJmYjMtMDdlYi00YWE4LWI3ODQtNTk0ODVmZGY4ZGQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU3MGJmYjMtMDdlYi00YWE4LWI3ODQtNTk0ODVmZGY4ZGQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000630/","name":"Liev Schreiber"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000673/","name":"Marisa Tomei"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765597/","name":"Peter Sarsgaard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1836315/","name":"Marc Meyers"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0337243/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0207528/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0744004/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1802437/","name":"Stephen Amidon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0610219/","name":"Oren Moverman"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I have neither seen the first one nor read the book, but this version of "Human Capital", mainly being carried on the shoulders of a great cast, is an effortful suburban tale of what happens when people get pushed to their limits, mental, physical and financial alike, a tale that sometimes hits and misses.\n\n"Human Capital" is a character-driven drama structured in retrospective kind of way, putting a single event in the center of it and then telling each character's journey and role in said event. This story-telling works well for the first hour, but as it progresses it also gets slower, leading into a silent and unsatisfying climax which in retrospect makes "Human Capital" feel more like a build-up in its entirety. The story and themes from which it's weaved from is realistic, relevant and tries to touch your strings, but does so unsurely. Financial hardships, father/daughter and husband/wife relationship problems, depression, suicide, sexual freedom - all of these themes are there on some level, but they don't connect together as well as they should've. It is the acting work by the well put together cast that makes up for some flaws, even the smaller roles are filled in with familiar faces and commendable performances. In my opinion, the brightest highlight shines on Live Schreiber and Maya Hawke. Visually it's quite obvious that "Human Capital" is made on a limiting budget and seems like most of it went to the cast (well deserved, good choice), so visually it has come out a standard indie drama/thriller flick, with no extraordinary solutions or distinctive characteristics.\n\n"Human Capital" is not a bad movie but neither is it memorable, it engages as a character-driven with enjoyable performances drama but has a knack to eventually underwhelm in most of the other areas. Recommended to those who are intrigued by its cast. My rating: 6/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9258,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-03-20","keywords":"children","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Human Capital","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2576727577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU3MGJmYjMtMDdlYi00YWE4LWI3ODQtNTk0ODVmZGY4ZGQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDU3MGJmYjMtMDdlYi00YWE4LWI3ODQtNTk0ODVmZGY4ZGQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000630/","name":"Liev Schreiber","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000673/","name":"Marisa Tomei","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765597/","name":"Peter Sarsgaard"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1836315/","name":"Marc Meyers"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0337243/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0207528/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0744004/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1802437/","name":"Stephen Amidon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0610219/","name":"Oren Moverman"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The cast are all spectacularly talented, and this film is another of those 'secret classics' which don't get the Oscars but actually deserve them. Gina Prince-Bythewood, the woman director, has made an intensely sensitive film about women, and it ain't no chick flic, it is serious stuff. I was knocked out by the sheer talent of the actresses. An eye opener to me was the incredible Queen Latifah. Apparently she is some kind of 'hip hop queen', but I wouldn't know about that, preferring Bach myself. She also 'raps', and I am one of those people who does not like or understand what they call 'rapping' at all, so I am glad she spared us that in the film. I notice from her bio that she was a basketball star in high school. Now that I can well believe, as she has the same 'body confidence' that another basketball player, Barack Obama, has. The director made a feature film about basketball earlier, so maybe that is how she and Miss Hip Hop the Rapper came together. But this woman Queen Latifah is a major example of Something Else. She has super-star quality. Really, I wanted to just rush up and hug her, that is how wonderful I think she was. However, the finest job of acting in this film full of genius is to my mind undoubtedly that of Sophie Okonedo, who plays the character May Boatwright, whose older sister and protector is Queen Latifah. She portrays a girl so tormented by 'not being quite right in the head', and so over-sensitive that she bursts into tears at the slightest thing, that it is hard to believe she is acting. It is a poignant performance, expressing to perfection the desperation of such a person who knows there is something wrong with her but can do nothing about it. The third sister is played by Alicia Keys, in real life a talented musician as well, and she portrays an over-intense hard-as-nails young woman terrified of marital commitment. Into this family comes the now teenaged Dakota Fanning, 'running away from home' as it were. She is making some progress with her speaking. Instead of 80 percent of her words being mumbled it is now down to about 20 percent. If she could ever master speech so that everything she said was comprehensible and audible, she could become a major actress, as her acting abilities are coming along nicely, and she effortlessly dominates scenes as long as Queen Latifah is not around (who has a greater command of the camera). I must say however that Dakota Fanning looked very tired to me, and maybe she ought to take a few months off, as she could burn out if she doesn't watch it, having worked non-stop practically since she was in the womb (I'm amazed she didn't star in something as a foetus). As for the story, it is very moving and emotional, a study in human conflicts, traumas, and feelings. This is the kind of film that women make, whereas men prefer making films where everybody gets killed. There's a gender lesson there somewhere! In this film, not even hope gets killed. So that means there is still hope.

The cast are all spectacularly talented, and this film is another of those 'secret classics' which don't get the Oscars but actually deserve them. Gina Prince-Bythewood, the woman director, has made an intensely sensitive film about women, and it ain't no chick flic, it is serious stuff. I was knocked out by the sheer talent of the actresses. An eye opener to me was the incredible Queen Latifah. Apparently she is some kind of 'hip hop queen', but I wouldn't know about that, preferring Bach myself. She also 'raps', and I am one of those people who does not like or understand what they call 'rapping' at all, so I am glad she spared us that in the film. I notice from her bio that she was a basketball star in high school. Now that I can well believe, as she has the same 'body confidence' that another basketball player, Barack Obama, has. The director made a feature film about basketball earlier, so maybe that is how she and Miss Hip Hop the Rapper came together. But this woman Queen Latifah is a major example of Something Else. She has super-star quality. Really, I wanted to just rush up and hug her, that is how wonderful I think she was. However, the finest job of acting in this film full of genius is to my mind undoubtedly that of Sophie Okonedo, who plays the character May Boatwright, whose older sister and protector is Queen Latifah. She portrays a girl so tormented by 'not being quite right in the head', and so over-sensitive that she bursts into tears at the slightest thing, that it is hard to believe she is acting. It is a poignant performance, expressing to perfection the desperation of such a person who knows there is something wrong with her but can do nothing about it. The third sister is played by Alicia Keys, in real life a talented musician as well, and she portrays an over-intense hard-as-nails young woman terrified of marital commitment. Into this family comes the now teenaged Dakota Fanning, 'running away from home' as it were. She is making some progress with her speaking. Instead of 80 percent of her words being mumbled it is now down to about 20 percent. If she could ever master speech so that everything she said was comprehensible and audible, she could become a major actress, as her acting abilities are coming along nicely, and she effortlessly dominates scenes as long as Queen Latifah is not around (who has a greater command of the camera). I must say however that Dakota Fanning looked very tired to me, and maybe she ought to take a few months off, as she could burn out if she doesn't watch it, having worked non-stop practically since she was in the womb (I'm amazed she didn't star in something as a foetus). As for the story, it is very moving and emotional, a study in human conflicts, traumas, and feelings. This is the kind of film that women make, whereas men prefer making films where everybody gets killed. There's a gender lesson there somewhere! In this film, not even hope gets killed. So that means there is still hope. Jennifer Hudson gives wonderful support as the character Rosaleen, who accompanies Dakota Fanning as she flees from her father to take refuge with these women who had once known her dead mother. This is a happy-sad story that tears and warms the heart at the same time. Any woman would love it, and even some men might like it in between all the crime movies and battle scenes which they normally watch, where the quality is so often judged quantitatively, i.e. by the body count or by the sizes of the explosions. Here the only quantities involved are the degrees of emotion, which are in the upper nineties at least.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-10-17","keywords":"f rated,cake,neglected child,psychological abuse,freedom","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Secret Lives of Bees: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2605646105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for The Secret Lives of Bees, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266824/","name":"Dakota Fanning","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1617685/","name":"Jennifer Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001946/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1650330/","name":"Sue Monk Kidd"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.\n\nSpielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.\n\nWhile titled "Lincoln," we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.\n\nOne requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.\n\nWith this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.\n\nBut that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley.

He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.\n\nSpielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.\n\nWhile titled "Lincoln," we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time.

The second part has a strong resemblance to Waking Life in it's psychedelic execution more than Waltz with Bashir.

There's a lot of futuristic noir flourishes, the movie is bathing in neon light and seedy environments. This isn't new, its Blade Runner-esque but the cinematography is admittedly gorgeous in this. Just because it has been done before (lately with Altered Carbon and Mute) doesn't make it any less impressive. It was a nice touch and it deserves to be mentioned, even if it doesn't quite save the movie.\n\nThe plot of Terminal is very reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's movies. There's some Snatch or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels moments but the whole movie doesn't operate as well overall. We get introduced to a bunch of seedy characters with dubious morals. They all come in and out of this train station in the middle of the night and the common thread between them is the character of Annie (Margot Robbie). She's an assassin who works part-time as a waitress and stripper. Through her comings and goings, we meet a terminally ill teacher Bill (Simon Pegg), a pair of mismatched hitmen Vince (Dexter Fletcher) and Alfred (Max Irons) and an odd janitor Clinton (Mike Myers). How these interactions play into the larger plot is a mystery to us until the final turn. The setup isn't bad, we've seen it before and although there are plot holes, none of them were bad enough to completely derail the movie. It was enough to keep me interested but I did find my attention drifting in and out because of the lack of cohesion. As a story, its very middle of the road for the genre.\n\nAny heat for this movie was likely due to Margot Robbie's involvement as the main character. She keeps climbing the ladder and its deserved, she's great and I consider myself a fan of hers. She's good in Terminal, she's surprisingly committed, and she carries the movie capably. I do agree with some of the other reviewers in that she comes off as British Harley Quinn, but she didn't phone it in. Pegg is his typical charming self, he's very low-key in this but he works well with Robbie and I particularly enjoyed the montage that they share near the tail-end of the movie. Fletcher and Irons were odd, neither of them were terrible but Fletcher was over doing it and Irons was a little stiff. It was nice to see Mike Myers again and I think he did about as well as he could have with the material. Its a big distance from where his character starts to where he ends up and it makes his performance a little awkward by the end.\n\nI was down the middle on Terminal for most of its run time for all the reasons listed above. It was never stellar, but it had its moments. I was more than ready to just let it float the rest of the way to whatever normal twist ending it had up its sleeve and call it a day. But when the confrontation comes between Annie and Bill, the movie doesn't just dip its toes into a pool of nonsense/crazy, it cannonballs into it. I wasn't just snickering, I was laughing when Terminal ended. Its not that the twist it takes is new, its handled in such a rough and implausible manner that I was shocked. But it didn't derail the movie for me, it actually improved it. It made Terminal memorable and while I would never say that this movie is good, its going to hold a place in my memory for insane plot twists.\n\nI feel a little guilty for giving Terminal as high of a rating as I have. I liked the style of the movie and some of the performances (notably Robbie, Pegg and some of Myers) were solid. But it never reached high enough for something great and in any other movie, that twist ending would have knocked it down to a 3 or a 4/10. But that ending pushed the movie from mediocre to so bad its good territory for me. I can't call Terminal excellent but if you enjoy campy cinema, this is something you should see. I'm giving Terminal a 6/10 and I feel like I'm being generous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21313,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-11","keywords":"bare chested male bondage,tied to a bed,revenge,written by director,wager","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi671922201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0Y2YwZDktYzc3Mi00ZjE3LWI3NmMtNjZiYmFlYTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0Y2YwZDktYzc3Mi00ZjE3LWI3NmMtNjZiYmFlYTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the dark heart of a sprawling, anonymous city, 'Terminal' follows the twisting tales of two assassins carrying out a sinister mission, a teacher battling a fatal illness, an enigmatic janitor and a curious waitress leading a dangerous double life.

This means that along with the beautiful autumn colors that emerge, the spooky season of Halloween also returns. Along with the jack o' lanterns, fun size candy, and parities, this is also when the often popular haunts come to town. These haunts cater to those that want something genuinely scary, as if they've stepped into their favorite horror movies...without the serial killers of course. I've only been to a few and have had more laughs then fears. This is because I more appreciate the haunts in a similar way a stage show is pulled off. \n\nSo why are there dedicated fans that keep going further with mazes where they tough you (yes, they can do that)? Again, it's a part of the Halloween atmosphere that a part of the escapism people desire. We already know were going to survive the night, but we love to see if our internal suspension of disbelief can activate and put us in the fear we want. I can understand it can be too intense for a lot of people, but again, it's all a part of the season. It's nice to see a movie like Hell Fest to set a slasher within a haunt park.\n\nA young college student Natalie (Played by Amy Forsyth) is visiting her former roommate Brooke (played by Reign Edwards) and classmate Taylor (played by Bex Taylor-Klaus). Not only are they going to the haunt park Hell Fest, but their meeting up with friends, including Gavin (played by Robby Attal) who got everyone V.I.P. passes (which means no line waiting). Along with the various people coming in, they see that Hell Fest of full of scare actors, several mazes to explore and even an entire land called "the Deadlands" where the actors are allowed to touch and go further with their scares. \n\nThe problem? An unnamed person enters the park and into the mazes and starts randomly killing off guests. Our heroes don't see anything wrong until this guy acquires a mask and starts to stalk them around. At first they dismiss him as a really good actor, but when friends start disappearing, they got more uneasy. Even when they try talking to security (who tells them that he can arrest someone for doing their job), they don't seem to have a lot of options. The further they get to the Deadlands, the more they feel like they've descended into hell.\n\nSo by reading this, you can already tell that Hell Fest follows a lot of slasher tropes that we've seen before; the group of college kids, unresponsive authority, walking along somewhere, killer with a mask, and such. This will definitely not appeal to those looking for a new kind of horror movie (like Hereditary). This seems to be more proud that it's trying to be a typical slasher. Because of that, I didn't mind it. A lot of it has to do with it's setting and atmosphere.\n\nHell Fest is full of theme park-like Halloween imagery that looks really cool. I was afraid they would try to pull off haunt mazes that only Hollywood effects teams were capable of. Instead, each maze has the right balance of over the top gory, but also over the top fakery. This feels like something that would be built at Knott's Berry Farm or Universal Studios. Part of me really wants to visit this place...without the killing of course. Even the scare actors seems spot on with some coming up to them at random points, and some in full makeup hosting scary shows about guillotines.\n\nStory is minimal as the what's served is an excuse to show off the park. The main actors like Amy Forsyth and Bex Taylor-Klaus do fine in their parts. Their interesting enough that we'd want to visit the park with them. Even when they are eventually chased by the killer (I swear, I don't even think they gave him a name), we do want to see them survive. Also like a lot of slashers, without giving anything away, it does tease for a potential sequel in a trope manner we've seen before. I'd, however, would love to see this continue.\n\nI'll give this seven tickets to Knott's Scary Farm out of ten. Hell Fest may be a typical slasher, but it's so atmospheric, that those that have been to these haunts will probably like it fine. It's hard to phrase it or be critical as it's also short, running no more then eighty-five minutes. It's a fun watch. So see it and understand it's all a prt of the show.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16182,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-09-28","keywords":"amusement park,haunted house attraction,masked killer,slasher,group of friends","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Band Teaser Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1220655897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3YzNhYWEtMTc4ZS00OTE3LTkzMDMtY2NlODlhMTc2NmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3YzNhYWEtMTc4ZS00OTE3LTkzMDMtY2NlODlhMTc2NmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A masked serial killer turns a horror themed amusement park into his own personal playground, terrorizing a group of friends while the rest of the patrons believe that it is all part of the show."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6407242/","name":"Cynthea Mercado"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4806678/","name":"Stephen Conroy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5046593/","name":"Amy Forsyth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687427/","name":"Gregory Plotkin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047306/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164393/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092570/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3466037/","name":"Seth M.

Lessons learned: men who don't want to marry and have children are portrayed as immature, self-absorbed, selfish, and misguided. Carting lots of screaming kids around in a minivan is, apparently, the most fun a man can have in this lifetime.

Now i love a good coming-of-age story, so when one is done right and is new and interesting it will probably be something i choose to watch more than once. Unfortunately this will not be one i am eager to re-watch but it is still a good, strong attempt at one of these films but it seems to get lost a few times along the way in terms of its storytelling. I'll start with the characters and performances, because i feel they were definitely the best parts of the film and added so much to making the film pretty enjoyable. Nat Wolff was great at playing Quentin, a shy awkward guy who had a signs of a lot of personality but needed the right people to bring it out. You really get to connect with his character as they made him come across as very real and not like a character per se. I may say that often but there are so many young actors really showing off their best stuff in these smaller personal films. Cara Delevingne was also great as Margo who was also quite odd and mysterious but was also very out there and confident at the same time, a great contrast to Nat's character. The rest of the supporting cast were also well acted, their distinct personalities were at times used for some cheap comedic relief but also had a greater purpose in adding to the complexity of our main character.\n\nThe first act of this film is really where the film gets to shine. You get the introduction to these characters (Quentin and Margo) and get to see their relationship and how it has changed and affected both these characters in the lead up to the events in the film. Watching them interact and bond was fascinating and charming at times and was a really good lead up into the events of the second act and understanding their actions. It was fun, light-hearted and was setting itself up for something great. All of the events so far had a fluid lead in to the second act which became more of a mysterious adventure whilst still trying to maintain that fun element somewhat unsuccessfully. The events of the first act are what get you through the very long second act that could have been cut down like 20 minutes. The second act was more focused on building up Quentin's character and having him face some tough and new decisions in his life. Although it was interesting and you do want to see where his character goes it was a noticeable step down from the fun light-hearted enjoyment in the beginning. There was this great interesting relationship set up and you are eager to find out how the film ties everything together, then you reach the third act and all of the storytelling falls apart. \n\nFor certain characters, their actions and reactions seem somewhat justified but for some others they just felt like another character entirely. There was nothing in the second act that really explained how or why these characters made such a drastic change in reasoning or personality. They try to explain it in the dying minutes but it was very rushed and didn't fit with the rest of the film. The problem was that there was no real progression from the events of the beginning to the events in the end for some characters and that led me to believe that the writers/directors knew how to approach certain sections but were completely lost for others. I believe, they knew how they wanted the film to begin and how to introduce these characters, and they also knew how they wanted it to end and what themes they wanted to explore. But what they didn't know was how to show that transition, and when a film has the beginning, and has the end it can be hard to fill in the guts of the film afterwards and show a distinct character progression. That's just my theory but whatever happened the storytelling was a bit of a mess. \n\nThat being said, it was still a good enjoyable film that tried too hard to be different or maybe not hard enough. It had great characters and performances, a fantastic first act, an interesting second act and a third act that didn't live up to what the rest of the film was building up to. Humour didn't really work that often but kept the film from becoming too dark, and there were signs of emotion but nothing that really affects you. In the end, it's enjoyable but there are better coming-of-age films out there (Boyhood / Me and Earl and the Dying Girl). - 6.3","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99680,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

Now, I never really write reviews because everyone's opinions vary distinctly and it seems kind of pointless to try to show them the "magic" of a certain movie if they refuse to see it, or to tell them how horrible it was as though I think that I'm really that much better of a director, writer, or whatever. But after reading such lines as "if you liked this film, you know nothing about film" and so on, I simply couldn't contain myself.\n\nFirst off, let me start by saying that I in no way respect Eminem as an artist. I personally despise rap and the "culture" that it creates in society full of pumped up punks trying to act tough or "hard", as they struggle in a societal structure that they perpetrate upon themselves. In fewer words: I hate listening to constant bitching and dated slogans about bitches and benjamins. And after hearing about Eminem's wife-beating and all around socially retarded mentality, I wanted less to do with 8 Mile on the probability that he may be receiving a percentage of the ticket sales. But, after a time, I ended up renting it at Blockbuster for the hell of it, at least to give it a chance. I popped it in, and I was all set and ready to hate every minute of it... but ended up sitting through a movie that actually left me with a smile on my face.\n\nFor those who've not yet seen the film, I'll give some background of the story. Eminem plays Rabbit, a struggling Detroit freestyle rapper trying desperately to make a name for himself in the bustling Detroit underground music scene. Kim Basinger plays his alcoholic mother, miserable and bitter of where her life has ended up (in a trailer park, barely able to make rent or take care of herself). Mekhi Phifer plays Future, Rabbit's best ally and, in some ways, his father figure; playing the role of the protective, guidance providing, loving role-model. Conflict stirs in Rabbit's life as, through his bouts with stage fright and homelessness, he begins to question his ability to make it in the world of music as he wishes to; nearly becoming content to simply abide life as he knows it. But through his experiences and how he works through his own personal problems, he starts to see his path better and more clearly.\n\nNow, I grew up in a very small town. A farming community in the middle of nowhere, where my nearest neighbors where half a mile away. I hated every minute that I was there and felt trapped in a world there that I didn't feel welcome in or a part of. Aspiring to become a filmmaker when everyone tells you you're an idiot for even thinking of it isn't easy. Which is probably why I related so much with this film. Rabbit's own experiences as well as his mother's criticism of him and his life make him feel trapped within his station of life, feeling as though his own specific voice isn't being heard, and trying desperately to change that. Anyone who doesn't recognize this is someone that I would generally think was lucky enough to not be born into this type of community structure with ideals that conflicted with the generally accepted norm; as it's thoroughly developed throughout the story. And the story... the story develops nicely over time. It never feels rushed or thrown together hastily just to make a movie with the star power of Eminem. That COULD have happened, and it COULD have made a lot of money for everyone involved. Instead, a director was chosen who understands pacing of a story, importance of cinematic elements throughout a story (i.e.: not just putting actors on screen to say their lines and that's it), and who just understands the elements of how to tell a good story on film. They even gathered a supporting cast of actual actors who've proven themselves as true artists within their craft in the past, and didn't just hand off the part to one of the executive producer's nieces or nephews or whatever. Scott Silver's loose adaptation of the life of Eminem was tweaked just enough to skew from Eminem's specific life, and become more universal in it's ability to portray a struggle that millions of artists go through around the world. All of these elements, along with my surprise at the actual acting ability of Eminem, combine to tell a story that feels deeply personal while very universal, and can be related to by more people than simply myself. It tells a story of never settling for what you can get just because it's easier, and that hard work and dedication are the only ways to dig your way out of a perpetual cycle that you may find yourself a part of.\n\nTo close, this is by no means the best movie that I've ever seen. Not even close. But that doesn't mean that it's not a prime example of filmmaking at it's best. A movie doesn't have to be the best thing since disco in order to be any good... it simply has to have a purpose and a message, and portray those with clarity and honesty; which this movie accomplishes in spades.\n\nSee this movie."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268350,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2002-11-08","keywords":"self expression,competition,rap music,hip hop,proles","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"8 Mile","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi615776537","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlOWUwNDUtZWM1Mi00Zjc3LTk1NjAtMGU1OTNjMGY3OTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlOWUwNDUtZWM1Mi00Zjc3LTk1NjAtMGU1OTNjMGY3OTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "March 18th""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004896/","name":"Eminem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005261/","name":"Brittany Murphy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000107/","name":"Kim Basinger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000436/","name":"Curtis Hanson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106989/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798788/","name":"Scott Silver"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This particular story is very reminiscent to Mike Flanagan's style where he places just as much importance into the heart and soul of the characters as the amount of detail in the creepy creatures or hauntings. It's definitely a great and promising first feature effort from Jacob Chase.\n\nThe film still does have its classic clichés with many predictable timed jump scares and the all too common tech themes of late , but it still wraps everything together nicely with some interesting concepts. There are some tremendous moments of authentic emotion portrayed by the main actors as well which is an underrated aspect especially in horror films.

This particular story is very reminiscent to Mike Flanagan's style where he places just as much importance into the heart and soul of the characters as the amount of detail in the creepy creatures or hauntings. It's definitely a great and promising first feature effort from Jacob Chase.\n\nThe film still does have its classic clichés with many predictable timed jump scares and the all too common tech themes of late , but it still wraps everything together nicely with some interesting concepts. There are some tremendous moments of authentic emotion portrayed by the main actors as well which is an underrated aspect especially in horror films. There's also a very interesting entity with a great backstory with some decent enough CGI to present it. The atmosphere and tension is prevalent and there are some clever camera choices.\n\nOverall it's way better than many will think it will be after seeing the very cliche trailer, and people shouldn't take it for just a kids horror.

Perhaps writing/editting and starring in the film robbed him too much of objectivity when it came to actually watching this bit of a non-story. He portrays "Max", a young French-Canadian man who is about to emigrate to Australia. At a party with his childhood friends, he and handsome best pal Matt (Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas) get lumbered with starring in a video being made by one of their number's pesky younger sister. The scene involved the two of them kissing - something neither had done (as an adult) with a man before. What ensues is a slow, deliberately so, depiction of the complications that this kiss has on their relationship. "Matt" has a long term girlfriend, so his reconciliation with his "new" feelings for his friend take on a different guise from those of the single "Max" who has issues with his recovering addict mother. Sadly, though, too much of those repercussions are presumed on us by the director and not demonstrated to the audience. It doesn't need to be a cheesy traditional romance, nor a sex fest, but we are left to imagine or envisage that they want each other only because we know that's what the film is about - not because we are presented with much tangible, or even implied, sense of desire. Indeed the others in their group more readily flirt and banter than the two in the title. It doesn't have a beginning, middle and end - it just has a middle. A rather interestingly filmed and quite well put together middle, but a middle nonetheless. Certainly worth watching - I think Dolan has something about him - but I wanted more from the characters and the story - as it is I just felt like a rather unsatisfied observer.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6595,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-10-09","keywords":"gay character,friendship,kiss,in love with best friend,mother son relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707182105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNjNTgxYjYtNzI1OS00MzUwLWE5MTEtMjJhZDZhMTllZDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNjNTgxYjYtNzI1OS00MzUwLWE5MTEtMjJhZDZhMTllZDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8570499/","name":"Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2954178/","name":"Pier-Luc Funk"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0489666/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053578/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093053/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Virtually every (French) male character is either selfish, arrogant, slimy, stupid or all of the above. Is every French man so worthless? \n\nWhy set a film in France if you are only going to ridicule and complain about the French? It's as if the filmmakers seem to think that only Americans know what is truly right and wrong and everyone else is either backwards or dumb. \n\nThe American attitude to other cultures is so condescending that one feels physically sick. In one scene, Glen Close's character thinks aloud about writing a book about the French and their strange ways, as if she were a Christian missionary or Imperialist, wanting to chronicle the quaint ways of the 'natives'.

Virtually every (French) male character is either selfish, arrogant, slimy, stupid or all of the above. Is every French man so worthless? \n\nWhy set a film in France if you are only going to ridicule and complain about the French? It's as if the filmmakers seem to think that only Americans know what is truly right and wrong and everyone else is either backwards or dumb. \n\nThe American attitude to other cultures is so condescending that one feels physically sick. In one scene, Glen Close's character thinks aloud about writing a book about the French and their strange ways, as if she were a Christian missionary or Imperialist, wanting to chronicle the quaint ways of the 'natives'. In another scene on a train someone asks "Is this the Middle Ages?", with the reply being, "No, this is France". Since Americans in general seem so intimidated by European culture and intelligence they feel they must deride all native Europeans in such a manner. \n\n Naomi Watts, someone whom I admire greatly, was so uninteresting and morose that I was glad whenever she left a scene. Whenever someone voiced an opinion or idea that was not 'hip-PC' then her character would grumble.\n\n'Le Divorce' was tough going, it wasn't entertaining in any way, nor is it a film I would recommend to anyone else.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-08-29","keywords":"american,french,love,sex,france","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Le Divorce","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1636958489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODIxZDhmOTUtZDE5OS00M2RlLWJkM2ItYjQxMjE2YWE0MjE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODIxZDhmOTUtZDE5OS00M2RlLWJkM2ItYjQxMjE2YWE0MjE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005028/","name":"Kate Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000330/","name":"Stockard Channing"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412465/","name":"James Ivory"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055367/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424956/","name":"Diane Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695609/","name":"Ruth Prawer Jhabvala","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412465/","name":"James Ivory"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I have neither seen the first one nor read the book, but this version of "Human Capital", mainly being carried on the shoulders of a great cast, is an effortful suburban tale of what happens when people get pushed to their limits, mental, physical and financial alike, a tale that sometimes hits and misses.\n\n"Human Capital" is a character-driven drama structured in retrospective kind of way, putting a single event in the center of it and then telling each character's journey and role in said event. This story-telling works well for the first hour, but as it progresses it also gets slower, leading into a silent and unsatisfying climax which in retrospect makes "Human Capital" feel more like a build-up in its entirety. The story and themes from which it's weaved from is realistic, relevant and tries to touch your strings, but does so unsurely. Financial hardships, father/daughter and husband/wife relationship problems, depression, suicide, sexual freedom - all of these themes are there on some level, but they don't connect together as well as they should've. It is the acting work by the well put together cast that makes up for some flaws, even the smaller roles are filled in with familiar faces and commendable performances. In my opinion, the brightest highlight shines on Live Schreiber and Maya Hawke. Visually it's quite obvious that "Human Capital" is made on a limiting budget and seems like most of it went to the cast (well deserved, good choice), so visually it has come out a standard indie drama/thriller flick, with no extraordinary solutions or distinctive characteristics.\n\n"Human Capital" is not a bad movie but neither is it memorable, it engages as a character-driven with enjoyable performances drama but has a knack to eventually underwhelm in most of the other areas. Recommended to those who are intrigued by its cast.

It takes you right into the heart of the darkest period in the 20th century, right into the heart of a Holocaust - Krakow in Poland, where the famous Plaszow ghetto was located and where the trains were loaded for Auschwitz. It's also a very intimate and moving portrait of a true friendship between two great artists. We get to see incredible suffering but also have a chance to witness a fantastic sense of humour, which obviously is the best way to deal with such sad memories. We can also now understand why Polanski refused to film "The Shindler's List" and instead filmed "The Pianist". We should be very grateful to film authors.

It takes you right into the heart of the darkest period in the 20th century, right into the heart of a Holocaust - Krakow in Poland, where the famous Plaszow ghetto was located and where the trains were loaded for Auschwitz. It's also a very intimate and moving portrait of a true friendship between two great artists. We get to see incredible suffering but also have a chance to witness a fantastic sense of humour, which obviously is the best way to deal with such sad memories. We can also now understand why Polanski refused to film "The Shindler's List" and instead filmed "The Pianist". We should be very grateful to film authors. PS - People who give this film a low rating obviously have not seen it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2021-08-20","keywords":"childhood","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1058543/","name":"Ryszard Horowitz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7061785/","name":"Bronislawa Horowitz Karakulska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8896961/","name":"Mateusz Kudla","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9896989/","name":"Anna Kokoszka-Romer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0701909/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9896989/","name":"Anna Kokoszka-Romer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8896961/","name":"Mateusz Kudla"],"duration":"PT1H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The cast are all spectacularly talented, and this film is another of those 'secret classics' which don't get the Oscars but actually deserve them. Gina Prince-Bythewood, the woman director, has made an intensely sensitive film about women, and it ain't no chick flic, it is serious stuff. I was knocked out by the sheer talent of the actresses. An eye opener to me was the incredible Queen Latifah. Apparently she is some kind of 'hip hop queen', but I wouldn't know about that, preferring Bach myself. She also 'raps', and I am one of those people who does not like or understand what they call 'rapping' at all, so I am glad she spared us that in the film. I notice from her bio that she was a basketball star in high school. Now that I can well believe, as she has the same 'body confidence' that another basketball player, Barack Obama, has. The director made a feature film about basketball earlier, so maybe that is how she and Miss Hip Hop the Rapper came together. But this woman Queen Latifah is a major example of Something Else. She has super-star quality. Really, I wanted to just rush up and hug her, that is how wonderful I think she was. However, the finest job of acting in this film full of genius is to my mind undoubtedly that of Sophie Okonedo, who plays the character May Boatwright, whose older sister and protector is Queen Latifah. She portrays a girl so tormented by 'not being quite right in the head', and so over-sensitive that she bursts into tears at the slightest thing, that it is hard to believe she is acting. It is a poignant performance, expressing to perfection the desperation of such a person who knows there is something wrong with her but can do nothing about it. The third sister is played by Alicia Keys, in real life a talented musician as well, and she portrays an over-intense hard-as-nails young woman terrified of marital commitment. Into this family comes the now teenaged Dakota Fanning, 'running away from home' as it were. She is making some progress with her speaking. Instead of 80 percent of her words being mumbled it is now down to about 20 percent. If she could ever master speech so that everything she said was comprehensible and audible, she could become a major actress, as her acting abilities are coming along nicely, and she effortlessly dominates scenes as long as Queen Latifah is not around (who has a greater command of the camera). I must say however that Dakota Fanning looked very tired to me, and maybe she ought to take a few months off, as she could burn out if she doesn't watch it, having worked non-stop practically since she was in the womb (I'm amazed she didn't star in something as a foetus). As for the story, it is very moving and emotional, a study in human conflicts, traumas, and feelings. This is the kind of film that women make, whereas men prefer making films where everybody gets killed. There's a gender lesson there somewhere! In this film, not even hope gets killed. So that means there is still hope. Jennifer Hudson gives wonderful support as the character Rosaleen, who accompanies Dakota Fanning as she flees from her father to take refuge with these women who had once known her dead mother. This is a happy-sad story that tears and warms the heart at the same time. Any woman would love it, and even some men might like it in between all the crime movies and battle scenes which they normally watch, where the quality is so often judged quantitatively, i.e. by the body count or by the sizes of the explosions. Here the only quantities involved are the degrees of emotion, which are in the upper nineties at least.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-10-17","keywords":"f rated,cake,neglected child,psychological abuse,freedom","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Secret Lives of Bees: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2605646105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for The Secret Lives of Bees, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266824/","name":"Dakota Fanning"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1617685/","name":"Jennifer Hudson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001946/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1650330/","name":"Sue Monk Kidd"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As the American Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0443272/","name":"Lincoln","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzczMDUyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM2ODEzOA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As the American Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0443272/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"StevePulaski"},"dateCreated":"2012-11-17","inLanguage":"English","name":"A capsule of a great president and a director's increasing maturity","reviewBody":"Daniel Day-Lewis is something of an unsung miracle; the man will come out of nowhere, select an unlikely role, knock it out of the park, then quietly crawl back into the ground for the next three or four years before repeating the same process. He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.\n\nSpielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.\n\nWhile titled "Lincoln," we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.\n\nOne requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.\n\nWith this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.\n\nBut that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley.

This alone and the base for the film scores all the way up to 6. (A for the spine to see this project though! ) This film, however, has a really great idea and lots of faults that have not been thought through- both in the story as well as in the timeline and the quality and feel. It feels like the director somehow didn't really trust his idea and so had to drag in random momentums from previous horror films. The movie could be mistaken for a poor filmatisation of a Stephen King novel. The base of the story is SO good it can stand on its own feet- it does NOT need copied scenes from Hollywood movies.\n\nThe music is an ambitious high-end orchestral sound track that sadly is composed by someone who doesn't really know anything about classical music and instead copies straight from American classics. My guess is the team that composed the music has no one who's gone through music school and are "self-taught" so to speak... I could be wrong, of course, but the music is not advanced (actually a bit flat and childish) and not original- however, the string section HAS to be original studio recordings- which is great! And played by professional orchestral musicians- THAT is something you can't miss. The fact that the foley is a bit obvious and out of place along with the music being too intense and overpowering leaves very little to the imagination, and sadly steals a lot of the intended creepiness of the movie. (Rule number ONE in horror- the sound is (usually) 80% of the movie!!!)\n\nThe child actors are not that great- but better than 90% of Hollywood (which is not much of an achievement). The trowel between the bricks is non existing and so the story, which has many great bricks (points, finesses)- falls apart. The finesses in the story leads to nowhere or are not properly focused on. It's like trying to juggle with 10 balls and catching only 5. Some stereotypical characteristics in characters occur, but that can of course be expected.\n\nI would love this movie to be "re-cut" and with a new soundtrack (I mean, keep the original, just don't shove it in every intense scene) and make more sense in the story (have someone else read it and screen it for people first to get feedback)- and then have someone properly grade it (no "auto-detect" gradient, which at the moment feels like the case). Then the movie would be so much more!\n\nOh- and Achoura is NOT only a Maroccan celebration. It's an Islamic celebration (which stretches beyond Marocco, for the ones that didn't know). If you write: Ashura in Google- you will find it.\n\nEnjoy the movie! It's worth a watch as, like I wrote, it still is the first horror movie by this guy.

So he is deciding to bet on local Little League games.\n\n"All Square" hits too many familiar beats to be memorable, also it remains low to the ground for the most part not to mention that it doesn't succeed on the humor front - probably because of the director John Hyams, who is an odd choice for this film 'cos of his previous involvement in the action genre ("Dragon Eyes", "Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning"). With a larger budget, "All Square" could have been more of a cinematic thriller with twists and turns at every corner. Instead, it's a smaller-focused feature film that serves as a character drama study. Basically, while "All Square" is not an entirely enjoyable ride, it's all a bit too thin. 6+/7-","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":440,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-10-12","keywords":"bookie,baseball,little league,betting,sports betting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"All Square","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2663037465","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI5ZDA1MzYtZjRjMi00YjViLTk0YjgtOTU3NzY5MmJkOTI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI5ZDA1MzYtZjRjMi00YjViLTk0YjgtOTU3NzY5MmJkOTI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0446672/","name":"Michael Kelly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6043297/","name":"Jesse Ray Sheps"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0781899/","name":"Pamela Adlon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404882/","name":"John Hyams"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0643102/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0667441/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9004197/","name":"Timothy Brady"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So he is deciding to bet on local Little League games.\n\n"All Square" hits too many familiar beats to be memorable, also it remains low to the ground for the most part not to mention that it doesn't succeed on the humor front - probably because of the director John Hyams, who is an odd choice for this film 'cos of his previous involvement in the action genre ("Dragon Eyes", "Universal Soldier: Day of Reckoning"). With a larger budget, "All Square" could have been more of a cinematic thriller with twists and turns at every corner. Instead, it's a smaller-focused feature film that serves as a character drama study. Basically, while "All Square" is not an entirely enjoyable ride, it's all a bit too thin. 6+/7-","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":440,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-10-12","keywords":"bookie,baseball,little league,betting,sports betting","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"All Square","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2663037465","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI5ZDA1MzYtZjRjMi00YjViLTk0YjgtOTU3NzY5MmJkOTI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDI5ZDA1MzYtZjRjMi00YjViLTk0YjgtOTU3NzY5MmJkOTI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0446672/","name":"Michael Kelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6043297/","name":"Jesse Ray Sheps","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0781899/","name":"Pamela Adlon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404882/","name":"John Hyams"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0643102/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0667441/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9004197/","name":"Timothy Brady"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The film felt realistic. Moody, downbeat and desperate. I could feel his stress. I felt for the character. Even if I didn't really get to know him too well.\n\nI could understand the move to Denmark but the journey there was very fortunate. It relied on sparse filming and vague story telling. You have to just accept he went from UK to Denmark in the blink of an eye and with a lot of luck.\n\nThe love interest was also another very fortunate bit of story telling. It really did start to stretch reality a little. The speed of him being alone to having dinner was a challenge. No real attempt to create a loving romance.\n\nBut this disbelief would be dwarfed by the gun And police station scenes. It was like they run out of time and tossed a coin for the ending. Super rushed and super convenient. The ending very anti-climatic, yet Subtle and A little understated.\n\nThis is not a comedy. It is a young man at the end. Hopeless.

The film felt realistic. Moody, downbeat and desperate. I could feel his stress. I felt for the character. Even if I didn't really get to know him too well.\n\nI could understand the move to Denmark but the journey there was very fortunate. It relied on sparse filming and vague story telling. You have to just accept he went from UK to Denmark in the blink of an eye and with a lot of luck.\n\nThe love interest was also another very fortunate bit of story telling. It really did start to stretch reality a little. The speed of him being alone to having dinner was a challenge. No real attempt to create a loving romance.\n\nBut this disbelief would be dwarfed by the gun And police station scenes. It was like they run out of time and tossed a coin for the ending. Super rushed and super convenient. The ending very anti-climatic, yet Subtle and A little understated.\n\nThis is not a comedy. It is a young man at the end. Hopeless. Finding a reason not to give up. The acting was good so it was easy to travel the story. I wanted more from it but what I got was okay. The lead actor is appearing in a lot of productions just lately and this film explains why. I believed his character story so that is a credit to him.

He needed to make sense of the world and this was through the cipher of Bruce Springsteen's lyrics and music.\n\nWhat was good,\n\n1, whilst dealing with racism it was presented as a feature of the time, it did not take over the movie.\n\n2, the story was more important than realism and we had moments when the movie took off with musical numbers.\n\n3, the whole cast did a brilliant job particularly the mum and the dad,\n\n4, Javed play by Viveik Kalra was a masterclass in micro-emotions, the whole movie rested on this young man and he delivered the goods. Skills way beyond his years.\n\n5, the music and graphic were great I just wish I was more familiar with the Boss's music but we were listening to Kate Bush and Duran Duran.\n\n6, Margaret Thatcher brought a decade of pain to Britain as she transformed a bankrupt state to a market economy. It was necessary but had terrible effects on people's lives and this was shown effectively here.\n\nThis was a very niche movie, very claustrophobic and there was very little action but I enjoyed it immensely.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2019-08-09","keywords":"aspiring writer,1980s,title based on song,teenager,semi autobiographical","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2113518617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThkMThiNTYtNjI0MC00YWFkLTg1YjQtNjVkYzg2MWZhODJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThkMThiNTYtNjI0MC00YWFkLTg1YjQtNjVkYzg2MWZhODJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"From writer/director/producer Gurinder Chadha ('Bend It Like Beckham') comes the inspirational drama 'Blinded by the Light,' set to the music and lyrics of Bruce Springsteen’s timeless songs."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7811397/","name":"Billy Barratt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9161436/","name":"Ronak Singh Chadha Berges"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9196203/","name":"Viveik Kalra"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149446/","name":"Gurinder Chadha"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390775/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209925/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1876954/","name":"Sarfraz Manzoor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149446/","name":"Gurinder Chadha"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0074488/","name":"Paul Mayeda Berges"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He needed to make sense of the world and this was through the cipher of Bruce Springsteen's lyrics and music.\n\nWhat was good,\n\n1, whilst dealing with racism it was presented as a feature of the time, it did not take over the movie.\n\n2, the story was more important than realism and we had moments when the movie took off with musical numbers.\n\n3, the whole cast did a brilliant job particularly the mum and the dad,\n\n4, Javed play by Viveik Kalra was a masterclass in micro-emotions, the whole movie rested on this young man and he delivered the goods. Skills way beyond his years.\n\n5, the music and graphic were great I just wish I was more familiar with the Boss's music but we were listening to Kate Bush and Duran Duran.\n\n6, Margaret Thatcher brought a decade of pain to Britain as she transformed a bankrupt state to a market economy. It was necessary but had terrible effects on people's lives and this was shown effectively here.\n\nThis was a very niche movie, very claustrophobic and there was very little action but I enjoyed it immensely.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2019-08-09","keywords":"aspiring writer,1980s,title based on song,teenager,semi autobiographical","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2113518617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThkMThiNTYtNjI0MC00YWFkLTg1YjQtNjVkYzg2MWZhODJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOThkMThiNTYtNjI0MC00YWFkLTg1YjQtNjVkYzg2MWZhODJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"From writer/director/producer Gurinder Chadha ('Bend It Like Beckham') comes the inspirational drama 'Blinded by the Light,' set to the music and lyrics of Bruce Springsteen’s timeless songs.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7811397/","name":"Billy Barratt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9161436/","name":"Ronak Singh Chadha Berges","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9196203/","name":"Viveik Kalra"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149446/","name":"Gurinder Chadha"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390775/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209925/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1876954/","name":"Sarfraz Manzoor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149446/","name":"Gurinder Chadha","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0074488/","name":"Paul Mayeda Berges"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

 --- Description: Fellwechselzeit: Directed by Sabrina Mertens. With Zelda Espenschied, Miriam Schiweck, Freya Kreutzkam, Bernd Wolf. The still life of a family in 57 pictures. Germany in the 1970ies. Stephanie is an intelligent and lively child. But she leads an isolated life with her parents, marked by the symbiotic bonding with her mentally unstable mother. A mother who has never really left her own childhood behind and who lives amidst things of the past and the memories connected to them. Stephanie's relationship with her father is one of mistrust. The passing years only bring aging, but no future. Unspoken thoughts lurk underneath the surface of everyday life. So Stephanie retreats into a dark world of barbaric fantasies, that are nourished by the traces of the past and only belong to her alone. One day, however, Stephanie's secret invades the family's reality." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt11758900/","name":"Fellwechselzeit","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGFkZGQ2ODctZjViOS00Yjc0LThjZjctZjg1YzliNTRlMDVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODU2NjIzMjc@._V1_.jpg","description":"The still life of a family in 57 pictures.

The latter leads him to a certain road trip to salvation when he embarks upon a few days of r&amp;r away from his stagnant day job as a middle school English teacher with his best friend and former college roomie Jack (Church in easily the career defining role of his life since his hey day on the TV sitcom 'Wings') whose impending nuptials is Miles' wedding gift as the best man.

One is the shapely and surprisingly-down-to-earth waitress Maya (Madsen in a career comeback of epic proportions shines through the Giamatti gloom) who strikes a fancy to the depressed Miles while Jack has his sights on the sexy wine pourer Stephanie (the sublimely, reassuringly funny Oh, and real  life wife to director Payne) who also is charmed by the blithely feckless Jack. What unfolds is a sweet yet too-good-to-be true few days of bliss and unbridled emotional rescue for the foursome as they take to one another like ducks to water although Miles' hesitancy is deeply reasoned since he is still licking the open wounds of his two-year old divorce.\n\nPayne, one of my favorite filmmakers, doesn't disappoint as he dollops evenly the tragic-comic proceedings with his frequent long-time collaborator Jim Taylor in adapting an unpublished novel by Rex Pickett that has many layers to it and doesn't betray its four intriguing and ultimately human characters with all their flaws and neuroses on full display.

I love it's style. It's a super intriguing character study that's is both emotional and hilarious and the lead performance by Diego Perretti is extremely nuanced and deserving of being placed up with some of the greats. I'm worried this won't get the attention it deserves so if you see this, find this movie, watch this movie, and please support it because I really wanna we what these directors have on store next. Also they seem like super nice people they were at the premiere.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":298,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2019-09-19","keywords":"reference to serge gainsbourg,male protagonist,violence,sauna,year 2014","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0673391/","name":"Diego Peretti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0629855/","name":"Julianne Nicholson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266723/","name":"Daniel Fanego"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4275547/","name":"Rania Attieh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2525426/","name":"Daniel Garcia"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0481533/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0419254/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0732895/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4275547/","name":"Rania Attieh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2525426/","name":"Daniel Garcia"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

It's lean and mean, a bit melodramatic in a few scenes, but also tough to stomach for its cruel depiction of corruption and murderous police units.

This prompts her to try and look for his murderers, and her search leads her to a police inspector who promises they will be found if she agrees to work for him as an informant. However, she soon realizes this also includes being part of a hit squad... the plot moves forward with no stop gaps after this point. It's a straightforward film that dabbles in complicated real life issues revolving around the Philippines' uncompromising police operations. Drug users and dealers are taken out with little thought given to their current affairs. If they're on the ominous drug watch list, it's uncertain how long they have left before a hit squad comes for them. Acting is convincing and cinematography vivid and gritty, especially in nighttime scenes, further amplifying the film's tense and morally grey narrative. Some of the more apparent flaws here include a feeling of predictability, as many events are easy to foresee, while the film also tends to state the obvious in some of the dialogues.

Macy on cornering the market of portraying losers as a cottage industry and in the latest endeavor of hapless misanthropes he may have found Oscar gold.\n\nGiamatti stars as Miles Raymond, a miserable mope of a man who realizes he is never going to amount to anything especially given the fact that he is his own worst enemy in his highly critical outlook on life particularly on two things he holds dear: his struggling attempts to become a writer of notice and his taste in wine. The latter leads him to a certain road trip to salvation when he embarks upon a few days of r&amp;r away from his stagnant day job as a middle school English teacher with his best friend and former college roomie Jack (Church in easily the career defining role of his life since his hey day on the TV sitcom 'Wings') whose impending nuptials is Miles' wedding gift as the best man.

One is the shapely and surprisingly-down-to-earth waitress Maya (Madsen in a career comeback of epic proportions shines through the Giamatti gloom) who strikes a fancy to the depressed Miles while Jack has his sights on the sexy wine pourer Stephanie (the sublimely, reassuringly funny Oh, and real  life wife to director Payne) who also is charmed by the blithely feckless Jack. What unfolds is a sweet yet too-good-to-be true few days of bliss and unbridled emotional rescue for the foursome as they take to one another like ducks to water although Miles' hesitancy is deeply reasoned since he is still licking the open wounds of his two-year old divorce.\n\nPayne, one of my favorite filmmakers, doesn't disappoint as he dollops evenly the tragic-comic proceedings with his frequent long-time collaborator Jim Taylor in adapting an unpublished novel by Rex Pickett that has many layers to it and doesn't betray its four intriguing and ultimately human characters with all their flaws and neuroses on full display. Each actor shines with a few moments of soliloquies and dialogue that ring true that will have you laughing til you cry and vice versa (and that my friend is no easy trick)!\n\nThe four actors give supremely wonderfully acted turns and all are Oscar worthy as well as the screenplay which mixes misery with hope and some truly funny moments including an anger management golf sequence that feels like an outtake from 'Caddyshack' and Giamatti's drunken phone call to his ex is on par with Jon Favreau's car-accident-in-slow-motion answering machine mishap in 'Swingers'  one for the archives. Church makes his borderline jerk a quasi-pathetic lothario who finally sees the forest for the trees in a surprisingly moving moment of realization in a teary confessional; Oh unleashes the old chestnut of a woman's scorn with no-holds-barred and Madsen is a true welcome back from a seemingly endless string of nothing vehicles into this warm and welcome turn as comforting as a blanket on a wintry night in front of a cozy fire.\n\nWhile it is so easy to resort to the wine as metaphor  as the film amply does with smart, sharp and pungent dialogue  the film is a full-bodied, never precocious vintage that needs to be savored in a desirable bouquet of cinematic finesse."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186143,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-10-22","keywords":"wine,road trip,vineyard,middle age,wine tasting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sideways","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi864551193","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWI2OGZmZWMtMjY5Yi00Zjk5LWEwMGYtM2NiOTY0MDdiYmRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWI2OGZmZWMtMjY5Yi00Zjk5LWEwMGYtM2NiOTY0MDdiYmRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0316079/","name":"Paul Giamatti"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002006/","name":"Thomas Haden Church"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000515/","name":"Virginia Madsen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668247/","name":"Alexander Payne"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088247/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133320/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681914/","name":"Rex Pickett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668247/","name":"Alexander Payne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852591/","name":"Jim Taylor"}],"duration":"PT2H7M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Church makes his borderline jerk a quasi-pathetic lothario who finally sees the forest for the trees in a surprisingly moving moment of realization in a teary confessional; Oh unleashes the old chestnut of a woman's scorn with no-holds-barred and Madsen is a true welcome back from a seemingly endless string of nothing vehicles into this warm and welcome turn as comforting as a blanket on a wintry night in front of a cozy fire.\n\nWhile it is so easy to resort to the wine as metaphor  as the film amply does with smart, sharp and pungent dialogue  the film is a full-bodied, never precocious vintage that needs to be savored in a desirable bouquet of cinematic finesse.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186143,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-10-22","keywords":"wine,road trip,vineyard,middle age,wine tasting","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sideways","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi864551193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWI2OGZmZWMtMjY5Yi00Zjk5LWEwMGYtM2NiOTY0MDdiYmRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWI2OGZmZWMtMjY5Yi00Zjk5LWEwMGYtM2NiOTY0MDdiYmRiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0316079/","name":"Paul Giamatti","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002006/","name":"Thomas Haden Church","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000515/","name":"Virginia Madsen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668247/","name":"Alexander Payne"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088247/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133320/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0681914/","name":"Rex Pickett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668247/","name":"Alexander Payne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852591/","name":"Jim Taylor"],"duration":"PT2H7M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Its the one of the best series i have ever watched.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":27910,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-01-03","keywords":"police officer,emergency,emergency responder,firefighter,first responder","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000291/","name":"Angela Bassett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470244/","name":"Peter Krause","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4091533/","name":"Oliver Stark"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276440/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0680695/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1004299/","name":"Brad Falchuk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0591101/","name":"Tim Minear","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614682/","name":"Ryan Murphy"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Episodes Mondays on Fox","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi357546521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDQwZTQ4MGUtYTMyNi00M2M5LWFmODUtMGUxYjc5MDM2Y2MxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDQwZTQ4MGUtYTMyNi00M2M5LWFmODUtMGUxYjc5MDM2Y2MxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The division's ability to stop murders before they happen is based on the psychic ability of three people who were mutant byproducts of a failed genetic program designed to help babies born from drug-dependent mothers. Cruise's character, John Anderton, is motivated by the loss of his own son, who was abducted and murdered six years earlier. Accordingly, he's a strong supporter of the controversial program, whose opponents feel it could potentially make an error and people might be wrongfully convicted, if not potentially rehabilitated. That action begins when Anderton is identified as a future killer, and he hits the road running.

Dick, author of Blade Runner, the atmosphere of a dark world with high technology having gotten out of hand, almost as though it snuck up on us without our knowing, remains the theme. To remind us that we aren't controlled by technology, but are nonetheless overrun by it, there are frequent references to current-day familiarities, such as department stores and restaurants, such as The Gap and McDonalds, where impressively entertaining high-tech mass marketing gadgets know what you've purchased before and offer new suggestions for consideration.

As Anderton begins to unravel the true story about the corruption behind the pre-crime program, he is lead even further towards his destination as predicted by the `pre-cognitives' who predicted his crime. To tell any more of the story would disclose too much; besides, it isn't necessary.

That said, my main gripe is the presumption that, in the future, anyone convicted of a crime before it happens is immediately sent to a state of suspended animation, an alternative form of the death penalty. This is obviously one of the main sources of controversy within the storyline, but anyone can see that, in almost all cases, the predicted murders were not premeditated, if not potentially accidental, in which case, psychological counseling and some form of probation would be enough. There's nothing to suggest in the film that the context is a police state, which would allow the premise to make sense. Yet, so much of the movie is based on this premise, that may be bothersome to the discerning viewer. There are many such similar oversimplifications, each of which could be quite easily solved with a minor change or a quick dialog line or two, hence a mild sense of sloppiness in direction.\n\nStill, in the end, these didn't bother me that much.

The division's ability to stop murders before they happen is based on the psychic ability of three people who were mutant byproducts of a failed genetic program designed to help babies born from drug-dependent mothers. Cruise's character, John Anderton, is motivated by the loss of his own son, who was abducted and murdered six years earlier. Accordingly, he's a strong supporter of the controversial program, whose opponents feel it could potentially make an error and people might be wrongfully convicted, if not potentially rehabilitated. That action begins when Anderton is identified as a future killer, and he hits the road running. This may sound a little like The Fugitive, but in this case, you don't know if the man on the run is--or, rather, will be--guilty.\n\nBased on a short story by futurist Phillip K. Dick, author of Blade Runner, the atmosphere of a dark world with high technology having gotten out of hand, almost as though it snuck up on us without our knowing, remains the theme.

The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt2080374/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"AlsExGal"},"dateCreated":"2017-07-08","inLanguage":"English","name":"an abstract portrait of the man..","reviewBody":"... in that you can argue about almost every stroke in the painting, yet when you stand back a few feet from the work, you realize that this is a more accurate portrayal of Steve Jobs than any photograph could be.\n\nFor example, Michael Fassbender looks nothing like Steve Jobs did at any point in his adult life, sounds nothing like Steve Jobs did. Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot?

 --- Description: Steve Jobs: Directed by Danny Boyle. With Michael Fassbender, Kate Winslet, Seth Rogen, Jeff Daniels. Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to paint a portrait of the man at its epicenter. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt2080374/","name":"Steve Jobs","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NTA2MTEwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg4NzU2NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to paint a portrait of the man at its epicenter.

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly.

Will Smith is as usual charismatic and had difficult shoes to fill after Robin Williams' take on the genie but he was seriously let down by the VFX in blue genie mode and a weak script. Another miscast Naomi Scott gave a good performance but I always felt i was looking at Indian and not Middle Eastern. In fact the film IS very bollywood with the Jasmin, Aladdin dance off Indian Style (and to Indian music) then Russian dancing(?) plus other times an Indian soundtrack. And i'm not even going to talk about that sorry excuse for a villain. No, no i am not. For a Disney movie set in large Kingdom it sure does feel quite quite small. It looked cheap too. Weird. Ultimately a dreadfully executed cash grab of a movie that no one asked for. Thanks D.

In fact the film IS very bollywood with the Jasmin, Aladdin dance off Indian Style (and to Indian music) then Russian dancing(?) plus other times an Indian soundtrack. And i'm not even going to talk about that sorry excuse for a villain. No, no i am not. For a Disney movie set in large Kingdom it sure does feel quite quite small. It looked cheap too. Weird. Ultimately a dreadfully executed cash grab of a movie that no one asked for. Thanks D. Thankfully this is exactly what i expected having seen the trailers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":247604,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2019-05-22","keywords":"hero,monkey,genie character,tiger,parrot","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Aladdin","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3875453977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBlZWE0ODEtY2VkNi00OTJiLTg5MzMtNjcyYTU3NDExY2U3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTBlZWE0ODEtY2VkNi00OTJiLTg5MzMtNjcyYTU3NDExY2U3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4565815/","name":"Mena Massoud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4305463/","name":"Naomi Scott"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0226345/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0699871/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005363/","name":"Guy Ritchie"],"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The saddest part is that it actually happened.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139093,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-01-16","keywords":"domination,binging on junk food,wrestler,pennsylvania,upper class","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi230469145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Foxcatcher tells the fascinating true story of corruption and the struggle for power between Olympic gold medal-winning brothers and an eccentric millionaire.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587955/","name":"Bennett Miller"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323215/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0754971/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296861/","name":"E.

Now people will complain about choosing a different cast then. The cast was final, end of story, get over it. Also unlike a lot of people in here I am really glad they did not change the story from the original. Since it is a remake I don't expect a whole new story that would totally ruin the original.

I like the fact that they kept the original songs. Unlike a LOT of people in here, I did not mind the autotune because I didn't want to hear the voices of the actors if they were bad. Now people will complain about choosing a different cast then. The cast was final, end of story, get over it. Also unlike a lot of people in here I am really glad they did not change the story from the original. Since it is a remake I don't expect a whole new story that would totally ruin the original. Besides, with the money Disney has made, a 2nd one is definitely coming, you'll get your different story. The visuals were OK but could have been better especially Belle's village.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":290795,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-03-17","keywords":"beast,fairy tale,heroine,beast's heart,remake of oscar winner","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Consideration Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179222553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress.

In Bennett Miller's dark and ominous Foxcatcher, the episode is framed as a true-life Faustian Tale. But the story is almost secondary to three outstanding dramatic performances -- two of which are given by men who are better known for their work in other genres.\n\nChanning Tatum stars as Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz. When we first meet him, he's already reached elite status by winning a gold medal. But the achievement hasn't allowed him to escape the shadow of his older brother, Dave, also a gold medalist. The younger Schultz wants more. He wants to be the best. His past prize also doesn't pay the bills. After training sessions, he's eating ramen noodles. All that changes, however, with a phone call from du Pont (Steve Carell) who offers to pay him and set him up in a first-class training facility on his Pennsylvania estate.\n\nLike Schultz, the multi-millionaire du Pont is a man in a seemingly enviable position who nevertheless wants something greater. He has family issues of his own, as he strives to please his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). He hopes he can make her proud by leading a team of wrestlers to gold in Seoul in 1988. But du Pont doesn't just want to be a benefactor. Even though he's little more than an extremely wealthy fan, with only a rudimentary knowledge of the sport, he wants to be seen as a coach and mentor to his wrestlers. And so, when Dave arrives to guide his brother, jealousy develops. Dave is everything du Pont wishes he could be, but isn't. He's a great teacher, a great leader. This leads to tension that slowly builds toward the story's shocking climax as du Pont's demons emerge.\n\nAs du Pont, Carell is almost unrecognizable beneath make-up and prosthetics. It's a quietly disturbing performance that will definitely have audiences and critics seeing the comic talent in a new light. Action/comedy star Tatum also has a breakthrough turn as the intense and driven young Schultz who grows increasingly uncomfortable under du Pont's subjugation. As a past Academy Award nominee, Mark Ruffalo's exceptional portrayal of the older Schultz comes as less of a surprise. But that doesn't make it any less notable or transformative. The normally wiry Ruffalo packed on a lot of muscle to play Dave Schultz. Here, he looks less like his Bruce Banner alter ego, and more like the Hulk himself. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly. This is a movie that derives drama from silent moments. In many key scenes, it's the words that aren't said that speak volumes.\n\nFoxcatcher features themes of control and manipulation, and wrestling functions as an apt metaphor. It's that most primal of sports – one in which you literally bend another person to your will. Ultimately though, the movie is a story about two people who reach for greatness, only to experience a great fall. And it's also the tale of a great man caught in the middle. The saddest part is that it actually happened.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139093,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-01-16","keywords":"domination,binging on junk food,wrestler,pennsylvania,upper class","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi230469145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Foxcatcher tells the fascinating true story of corruption and the struggle for power between Olympic gold medal-winning brothers and an eccentric millionaire."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587955/","name":"Bennett Miller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323215/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0754971/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296861/","name":"E.

It manages to basically ignore the fact that they were Jewish. It's like like making a documentary about blues and say it was created by Americans, without mentioning they were black. A Polish director, trying to give Poles credit for what was a Jewish creation, while the reason they left Poland was the terrible anti-sémitism. Not a word about why they left.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":86,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2020-07-01","keywords":"american dream,hollywood","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000953/","name":"Peter Bogdanovich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0321621/","name":"Richard N.

The film was foot-tapping fun and the dark turn it took in the third act, while unexpected, made it edgy and different for me. When a sequel was announced, I thought it seemed unnecessary. How far can you really stretch the premise of penguins who can dance and sing? Apparently, not that far. After viewing the sequel, it very much does seem unnecessary and wholly forgettable within ten minutes after you walk out of the theater, which is disappointing to say the least. Other than this, the main problem with HAPPY FEET 2 is that there aren't that many good musical numbers as compared to the first one. Most of them are pretty mediocre. However, there are probably around three that range from good to great, one of which uses the song "Under Pressure," which is easily the best number in the entire film.\n\nAnother problem I had was the dark tone of the film. It's a bit TOO dark, if you ask me. You see the younger penguin characters constantly be put in danger which made the film very uncomfortable to watch, and what these characters go through in the film would probably traumatize them for life. The film also suffers from messy storytelling. For example, the subplot with the shrimp characters (voiced by Matt Damon and Brad Pitt) seems to come from nowhere and is out of place from the rest of the film. It also doesn't help that the characters are so damn annoying. As for the 3D, it's put to good use in some places but, overall, it's really unnecessary. The one good thing I can say about the film is the look of it, which is very beautiful. I also liked Pink a lot, who gives a boost for all the musical numbers she sings in, along with Robin Williams, who has a few great jokes up his sleeves.\n\nOverall, HAPPY FEET 2 is a disappointment considering that I am a fan of the first film.

The gangster theme is pretty cool and as a Muslim it's also interesting to hear Asalamalaikum and Alhamdulillah so many times in a show about gangsters. Anyway, great show, super gritty and tough but very entertaining. I recommend watching in German with the English sub-titles, the language is so cool too and of course the music is some really cool German hip hop.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-08","keywords":"business,female front nudity,strippers,adult movie theater,unprotected sex","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1391248/","name":"Kida Khodr Ramadan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7194136/","name":"Veysel Gelin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3137668/","name":"Almila Bagriacik"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0312451/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352514/","name":"Hanno Hackfort","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1293138/","name":"Bob Konrad","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0472277/","name":"Richard Kropf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Staffel 3 [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1761132313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGM4MTZiYTgtZTlmNy00NzYyLWFkOTItOTU5OTlkOGM3OGU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGM4MTZiYTgtZTlmNy00NzYyLWFkOTItOTU5OTlkOGM3OGU2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Rosario Dawson plays the yardmaster that assists from headquarters while Jessy Schram plays the separated wife of the newbie conductor.\n\nThe movie's based on the real-life CSX 8888 Incident, otherwise known as the Crazy Eights Incident, which involved a runaway freight train in northwestern Ohio in 2001. Locomotive #8888 was pulling 47 cars, including some with hazardous chemicals, and ran unmanned for two hours and 66 miles at speeds of up to 51 mph. (***Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know how the real-life incident ended before seeing the movie***). Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed, as did an attempt by police to shoot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which didn't work because the button has to be pressed for several seconds before the engine shuts down due to lack of fuel. A northbound freight train took succor in a siding area where the crew released its locomotive and waited for the runaway to pass. Like in the movie, they had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, a relative neophyte conductor. They proceeded to chase the runaway train and successfully locked on to the rear car of the runaway, then slowing it by applying the dynamic brakes or their locomotive. Once the runaway had slowed to 11 miles per hour, trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, jumped on, and shut down the engine.\n\nWhile the movie starts somewhat bland it quickly picks up momentum for a realistic non-stop thrill ride. The realism is refreshing in this day and age of cartoony action blockbusters and their multiple "yeah, right" action scenes (not that there's anything wrong with those movies, as long as you're in the right mode). Washington and Pine make for good protagonists and you start to care about them as the story progresses. Moreover, the movie doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 98 minutes.\n\nThe film was shot in numerous locations extending from central Pennsylvania to eastern Ohio, which serve up a nice rolling hills backdrop with the occasional river. Minor note: You'll observe a woodchuck scamper across the tracks in one scene where he/she thankfully DOESN'T become ground chuck.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: "Unstoppable" is worthwhile as a believable disaster thriller. While it lacks the potent subtext and overall greatness of 1985's "Runaway Train," it makes up for it with its realistic and kinetic tone, not to mention the fact that it's based on a true incident.\n\nGRADE: B","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-11-10","keywords":"train,runaway train,train engineer,freight train,train movie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unstoppable: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3068790297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A rail company frantically works to prevent an unmanned, half-mile-long freight train carrying combustible liquids and poisonous gas from wiping out a city."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276484/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093560/","name":"Mark Bomback"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Critically acclaimed. It's not just popcorn entertainment anymore--we have higher expectations. And as the blockbusters strive for the quality of the more highbrow indie offerings being nominated for Oscars, they begin resembling them in a way.\n\nThe Harry Potter films, especially the first few, had a sort of snappy storytelling to them. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them does not. It's much slower like the later films in the previous series. Yet, the difference is, this is the setup to the next four films.

We get to go inside this magical suitcase and see dozens of unique creatures in this new expanded universe. It's really cool and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe movie is long and not enough happens to truly justify it. Instead of using the time to thoroughly explain some of the overarching story lines, the filmmakers spend it drawing things out. Perhaps because they feel like they have to.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the film is great. It's thoroughly enjoyable. It does most of the things a good film should do. While the storytelling isn't quick, it's still very even.\n\nThis is what director David Yates is good at, as evident in the last four Harry Potter films he directed. Though Fantastic Beasts is missing the magical world that is Hogwarts, Yates knows how to bring alive New York City in the '20s and make it feel magical.\n\nYou will most likely enjoy Fantastic Beasts.

It looked different enough to distinguish itself, but similar enough to not appear vastly different. Them being adults instead of kids was interesting, and the changed-around races and jobs could have worked. Unfortunately, it's lost in a sea of expositional arguing (don't tell, show) and agenda (political, real, or pretend)-driven drama. Waited 20 minutes to start feeling something but I couldn't. Too bad, because without the forced statements and with another pass at the script, it might have had something. Maybe other less aware viewers will find something to it, but I gotta give it a pass.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11074,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-01-15","keywords":"remake,location in series title,city name in series title,alien","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3471005/","name":"Jeanine Mason","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1452155/","name":"Nathan Parsons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4266732/","name":"Michael Vlamis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0429120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0087778/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6092900/","name":"Carina Adly MacKenzie"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Comic-Con Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2764552985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGViMmM3NDQtNGMwOC00ZjU2LWJiYjktZjA4ZTMwMDFjMzg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGViMmM3NDQtNGMwOC00ZjU2LWJiYjktZjA4ZTMwMDFjMzg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Comic-Con Trailer for "Roswell, New Mexico," a new series coming to the CW."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

One of the aspects I love most about Return of the King, my favourite of Jackson's adaptations and one of my favourite films of all time, is the sprawling, mass fantasy battle scenes and The Battle of Five Armies is pretty much one elongated battle scene. However, there's something that's not quite right.\n\nIt's not the lack of emotion, characterization or plot. Indeed, there are plenty of those, there is just something I just can't put my finger on that stops the film from being truly epic. Perhaps it is because, for me at least, this film will always live in King's shadow but, really, where I think the film falls down, is that the battles simply aren't done well enough. The context is not explained very well, the actual engagements not that exciting too much repetition and, most crucially, too much cutting away from one place to another. This cutting worked fine, well, even, in Two Towers between the crucible of Helm's Deep and the quiet conversation of the Entmoot, but, here, there are just too many places that the actions flits between. I appreciate this is a battle of five armies, and that there are plenty of characters, but, sadly, the action did seem to be all over the place. And the repetition I mentioned earlier: a huge portion of the film seemed to be entirely composed of either someone running to warn others, a main character leading the charge into battle, and several one-on-one battles. The latter may be entertaining, sure, but there is a line which is stepped over in this film.\n\nThe ending, too, seemed like it was rushed by the filmmakers, especially when we consider that we don't actually find out what happens to the Arkenstone in the end. Many people criticised Return of the King's dragged out ending, but that was full of emotion and was a fitting, yet sad, farewell. Here, where not only does Bilbo say farewell to Gandalf and the Dwarfs, but where we say an almost certain farewell to Middle Earth, the end is far too brief and unlikely to instil emotion. Though, it is, to be fair, nicely linked into Fellowship.\n\nUltimately though, the film has plenty of positives. Despite being full of battle sequences, Jackson fits in plenty of emotional scenes and develops many of the characters fantastically.

One of the aspects I love most about Return of the King, my favourite of Jackson's adaptations and one of my favourite films of all time, is the sprawling, mass fantasy battle scenes and The Battle of Five Armies is pretty much one elongated battle scene. However, there's something that's not quite right.\n\nIt's not the lack of emotion, characterization or plot. Indeed, there are plenty of those, there is just something I just can't put my finger on that stops the film from being truly epic. Perhaps it is because, for me at least, this film will always live in King's shadow but, really, where I think the film falls down, is that the battles simply aren't done well enough. The context is not explained very well, the actual engagements not that exciting too much repetition and, most crucially, too much cutting away from one place to another. This cutting worked fine, well, even, in Two Towers between the crucible of Helm's Deep and the quiet conversation of the Entmoot, but, here, there are just too many places that the actions flits between. I appreciate this is a battle of five armies, and that there are plenty of characters, but, sadly, the action did seem to be all over the place. And the repetition I mentioned earlier: a huge portion of the film seemed to be entirely composed of either someone running to warn others, a main character leading the charge into battle, and several one-on-one battles. The latter may be entertaining, sure, but there is a line which is stepped over in this film.\n\nThe ending, too, seemed like it was rushed by the filmmakers, especially when we consider that we don't actually find out what happens to the Arkenstone in the end. Many people criticised Return of the King's dragged out ending, but that was full of emotion and was a fitting, yet sad, farewell. Here, where not only does Bilbo say farewell to Gandalf and the Dwarfs, but where we say an almost certain farewell to Middle Earth, the end is far too brief and unlikely to instil emotion. Though, it is, to be fair, nicely linked into Fellowship.\n\nUltimately though, the film has plenty of positives. Despite being full of battle sequences, Jackson fits in plenty of emotional scenes and develops many of the characters fantastically. In particular, Armitage's Thorin is different and darker, yet changes a great deal throughout the film - all in all, a fantastic performance. There's plenty of typical Jackson humour, some brilliant cameos and some great nods to the Lord of the Rings films and some elements of the film's production, which die-hard fans will no doubt pick up on with a smile. It's also important to realise that, whilst it's easy to criticise the long battle sequences, they are entertaining, and keep the pace of the film up throughout.\n\nSo, whilst it is easy to concentrate on the negatives and, in particular, the lack of a Grey Havens-esque adieu to Middle Earth, The Battle of Five Armies is still a great film and a fitting end to what has been a true achievement: a series of beautiful film adaptations that many will be sad to see end.\n\n\n* Ed\n","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":497786,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2014-12-12","keywords":"middle earth,army,epic,hobbit,epic battle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1092005657","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTk3MDk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc0MDgzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2OTk3MDk0Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzc0MDgzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Bilbo and Company are forced to be embraced in a war against an armed flock of combatants and the terrifying Smaug from acquiring a kingdom of treasure and obliterating all of Middle-Earth.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0293509/","name":"Martin Freeman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0035514/","name":"Richard Armitage"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909638/","name":"Fran Walsh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101991/","name":"Philippa Boyens","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

A wonderful actor.\n\nWhat struck me right away was the extremely good, scored intro, the music throughout Dystopia is of I am a genuine fan of classic horror, so I was a bit suspicious when I heard VIAPLAY was doing Dystopia but boy was I surprised for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that it truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is. The Director of Dystopia is Richard Jarnhed and I need to keep an eye out for his future endeavors as he is madly talented.\n\nAnd secondly this was directed by just one director. Richard directed all 8 episodes and that's not normal in Scandinavia.\n\nAnd lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.\n\nThe acting is wonderful and directing is amazing. I was totally blown away by the music!\n\nIt is always nice to see a TV-series with some twists, and also those that give you some food for thought.\n\nI am a bit blown away by the rather week reviews in Swedish press. One outlet even writes that it's outside the box and that they love the box. I am sure Dystopia will do very well internationally!\n\nIf you like Horror tension and at the same time mystery tension you should see Dystopia.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2300,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2021-06-13","keywords":"lesbian kiss,lesbian sex,topless female nudity,larp,larpers","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11198177/","name":"Lola Zackow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4477198/","name":"Madeleine Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7154476/","name":"Johan Hafezi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004517/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Seldom have I seen such a fun programme. Yes, fun. This was funny, sexy, violent, bonkers and emotionally truthful in a way that other series fail to achieve.\n\nTo think that this was aiming for any kind of historical accuracy is mad. It was made as an entertainment riffing on possible historical events. The use of modern language, initially jarring, ends up working to its advantage. There's no more reason to dislike modern usage than there is to dislike cod medieval or cod turn of the millennia language. Any language choice is going to be inauthentic so you might as well go for modern vernacular which has the side effect of milking the dialogue for humour. Using Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man for the theme tune is as inspired as using Nick Cave for the theme tune of Peaky Blinders. \n\nYou might also like to note the satirical reference to other well-known franchises and the use of Shakespearian minor characters. The two centurions sampling the "stash" of the witch doctor was comedy gold.\n\nYes, how we all hunger for the certainty of the old days when you knew where you were. When Loved It or Hated It reviews could be searched on and all TV programmes followed the same rules and were as bland as each other. Now all we have left is "helpful" so please regard this review as a provocative Loved It review.

Let me just get that out of the way. But he isn't perfect. Take for example the song, "Live and Let Die", a song he wrote in the '70s for a Bond movie of the same name. The song is used briefly in Dreamworks' latest outing for everyone's favorite Scots ogre. In the song he actually wrote this line: "But if in this ever changing world in which we live in". "In which we live in"? Was he kidding? A great talent, but that is some lazy songwriting. I figure he was either exhausted, or under contract, as opposed to being inspired.\n\nAnd that's the problem with this entire movie. The writing is simply not up to par. The story is loaded down with so many different elements that it is impossible to develop any of them. You can almost see the writers thinking, "Okay, now we've got a bunch of stuff for Shrek, Donkey, and Puss to do. Let's put in some stuff for Fiona and Lillian here..." The result is that there's a script, but no real story. And the dialog with some exceptions, is full of the clichés they so happily lampooned in earlier Shreks. The result comes across as a 3rd or 4th draft. \n\nAndrew Adamson directed the previous two Shreks and has one of the writing credits here, but he did not direct it.

Let me just get that out of the way. But he isn't perfect. Take for example the song, "Live and Let Die", a song he wrote in the '70s for a Bond movie of the same name. The song is used briefly in Dreamworks' latest outing for everyone's favorite Scots ogre. In the song he actually wrote this line: "But if in this ever changing world in which we live in". "In which we live in"? Was he kidding? A great talent, but that is some lazy songwriting. I figure he was either exhausted, or under contract, as opposed to being inspired.\n\nAnd that's the problem with this entire movie. The writing is simply not up to par. The story is loaded down with so many different elements that it is impossible to develop any of them. You can almost see the writers thinking, "Okay, now we've got a bunch of stuff for Shrek, Donkey, and Puss to do. Let's put in some stuff for Fiona and Lillian here..." The result is that there's a script, but no real story. And the dialog with some exceptions, is full of the clichés they so happily lampooned in earlier Shreks. The result comes across as a 3rd or 4th draft. \n\nAndrew Adamson directed the previous two Shreks and has one of the writing credits here, but he did not direct it. I guess the franchise is so important now that it must be handled by two directors, neither of whom has Adamson's knack for timing. At various points in the evening, the pace was surprisingly ponderous.\n\nIt's not unpleasant, as movies go.

It's all based on fact (from Jon Ronson's book) but the concept is so silly that director Grant Heslov and George Clooney (both worked on "Good Night, and Good Luck) really can't help but make fun of it, and there are some good laughs here. Just no real story.\n\nEwan McGregor plays journalist Bob Wilton, a jilted husband who goes to war to forget his backstabbing wife only to end up wiling away in Kuwait. One night he meets Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney), a familiar name to him from a previous interview he did years before about psychic-spies. Lyn was the best in what was called the "New Earth Army", started by Vietnam-Vet Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) in the 80's to create soldiers with super-powers who could prevent conflict. The Army was later dismantled and used for evil purposes by the movie's antagonist Hooper (Kevin Spacey) but Lyn tells Bob he's been re-activated, and has a secret mission to do in Iraq. Bob, thinking Lyn crazy but interesting at the same time, decides to team up with him and go where the action is. Along the way, Lyn tells him stories of others dubbed, "Jedi Warriors." \n\nMost of the movie is flashbacks, beginning with Iraq War 2003 and chronicling all the way back to the beginning of New Age warfare. There are weird and crazy laughs to be had like Lyn's initiation, where Django urges him he will never be a soldier unless he can free the dance. The lines are good too. "We tried invisibility but then worked it down to just not being seen", Lyn tells Bob upon their first meeting. Clooney is perfectly eccentric as a guy who lives by the mindfulness-over-warfare principal and McGregor is a whiny, but solid straight-man. Bridges is also terrific as this free-spirited hippie. Only the laughs and flashbacks (which feel like a series of sketches) aren't enough to distract from the fact that "Goats" really has no compelling narrative. The forward-moving story in Iraq 2003 has very little momentum. Spacey appears later on again as the villain but the conflict is weak and the movie has more than over-stayed its welcome.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130167,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","War"],"datePublished":"2009-11-06","keywords":"satire,army training,iraq war,secret military operation,goat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Paranormal Activity -- "Paranormal Goats" TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi309003545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzI0OTM0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDgwMDg5Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzI0OTM0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDgwMDg5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A TV trailer for the movie Paranormal Activity."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000228/","name":"Kevin Spacey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381416/","name":"Grant Heslov"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104115/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0184096/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740160/","name":"Jon Ronson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661186/","name":"Peter Straughan"}],"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The magical component that Stallone achieved was to tell nearly the exact same story, twice in a row, with the same characters... and yet, he gives us a one-two punch that hits just solidly as the first.\n\nIt's truly a remarkable feat. Differences? We've already met all the characters. Gone is the sense of discovery, the sense of learning who these people are. We already know, don't we? Yet, Stallone's characters are sufficiently interesting enough for us to want to spend more time with them, seeing them in a world most of us don't know, living a life few of us would really want. While the sense of discovery about these characters is gone, our joy of being a voyeur into their world is not.\n\nIt's a toss up which movie, "Rocky" or "Rocky II," asks us to suspend disbelief more. In "Rocky," we have to accept that a nobody, unrated, club fighter could a) get the chance to fight the world champion. B) He could possibly defy all odds and go the distance. That's a huge stretch only possible in Hollywood movies, classifying the first movie as a fairy tale along the lines of Cinderella.\n\nSoap opera-esquire is not a bad way to characterize "Rocky II" because of the emotional ride, but I don't find it as trite as a soap opera. Rocky's actions are very believable, from his earnings feeling like a fortune to him (when they were obviously not), to his illiteracy and his unsophisticated, "punch drunk" boxer. The ramifications of his past are believable. He fritters away the money and is unable to capitalize on his 15 minutes of fame. Hey, it happens all the time. Very believable.\n\nWith a pregnant wife, no job, and no way to pay his bills, he's backed into a corner. What's a fighter to do? (And in this case, I mean "a fighter" in its most literal sense.) He's willing to risk his health and even his marriage to do what any man should do: provide for his family.\n\nAdrian's bit of drama is the single "problem" with the movie, but it's also the heart of the movie. It's not a movie about losing it all and coming back again, it's much more than that. It's about a simple man who's trying to do the best he can with the only tools he has. And when Adrian is first to go down for the count, it puts it all in jeopardy.\n\nIt's not until his wife is ready to accept him as he is, for what he is, that he can continue his quest, one more fight, for his family, for himself.\n\nThe story arc feels so similar to the first movie that this one is often tossed to the side, yet it truly is amazing how Stallone managed to re-imagine all the magic of the first movie and, better still, give us a second helping of it that's just as sweet. Enjoy!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200561,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1979-06-15","keywords":"rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,rocky balboa jr character,mickey goldmill character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rocky II","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2087782169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI5MjQ4YmEtMGVhNC00ZTYxLWEzNTctN2YzNTJiODg1OGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI5MjQ4YmEtMGVhNC00ZTYxLWEzNTctN2YzNTJiODg1OGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Rocky II"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054262/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Rocky struggles in family life after his bout with Apollo Creed, while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0079817/","name":"Rocky II","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGFjMTdmOTktNTJkNi00YWM2LTgzZjYtOWVkMTUyMGNjZDUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMwNDgzNjc@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rocky struggles in family life after his bout with Apollo Creed, while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0079817/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"kezop_male","dateCreated":"2005-10-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"Same Story, Both Continued AND Re-told","reviewBody":"I'm old enough to remember the thrill of seeing each of the "Rocky" films during their original, theatrical runs. The magical component that Stallone achieved was to tell nearly the exact same story, twice in a row, with the same characters... and yet, he gives us a one-two punch that hits just solidly as the first.\n\nIt's truly a remarkable feat. Differences? We've already met all the characters. Gone is the sense of discovery, the sense of learning who these people are. We already know, don't we? Yet, Stallone's characters are sufficiently interesting enough for us to want to spend more time with them, seeing them in a world most of us don't know, living a life few of us would really want. While the sense of discovery about these characters is gone, our joy of being a voyeur into their world is not.\n\nIt's a toss up which movie, "Rocky" or "Rocky II," asks us to suspend disbelief more. In "Rocky," we have to accept that a nobody, unrated, club fighter could a) get the chance to fight the world champion. B) He could possibly defy all odds and go the distance. That's a huge stretch only possible in Hollywood movies, classifying the first movie as a fairy tale along the lines of Cinderella.\n\nSoap opera-esquire is not a bad way to characterize "Rocky II" because of the emotional ride, but I don't find it as trite as a soap opera. Rocky's actions are very believable, from his earnings feeling like a fortune to him (when they were obviously not), to his illiteracy and his unsophisticated, "punch drunk" boxer. The ramifications of his past are believable. He fritters away the money and is unable to capitalize on his 15 minutes of fame. Hey, it happens all the time. Very believable.\n\nWith a pregnant wife, no job, and no way to pay his bills, he's backed into a corner. What's a fighter to do? (And in this case, I mean "a fighter" in its most literal sense.) He's willing to risk his health and even his marriage to do what any man should do: provide for his family.\n\nAdrian's bit of drama is the single "problem" with the movie, but it's also the heart of the movie. It's not a movie about losing it all and coming back again, it's much more than that. It's about a simple man who's trying to do the best he can with the only tools he has. And when Adrian is first to go down for the count, it puts it all in jeopardy.\n\nIt's not until his wife is ready to accept him as he is, for what he is, that he can continue his quest, one more fight, for his family, for himself.\n\nThe story arc feels so similar to the first movie that this one is often tossed to the side, yet it truly is amazing how Stallone managed to re-imagine all the magic of the first movie and, better still, give us a second helping of it that's just as sweet. Enjoy!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200561,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1979-06-15","keywords":"rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,rocky balboa jr character,mickey goldmill character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rocky II","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2087782169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI5MjQ4YmEtMGVhNC00ZTYxLWEzNTctN2YzNTJiODg1OGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI5MjQ4YmEtMGVhNC00ZTYxLWEzNTctN2YzNTJiODg1OGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Rocky II","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054262/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

This movie is mediocre, though most of the acting was reasonable, given the unusual situations the characters find themselves in. Anne Hathaway, who I do not particularly like, was reasonably good as a therapist facing some unusual situations. Her love interest, whose name I haven't bothered to look up, was adept at playing a character who is creating those situations for Anne.

I will admit that I laugh most times I watch it, sometimes I groan because of the stupidity, but I usually have a smile on my face.\n\nThe plot? Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is a washed-up model who has been brainwashed to kill a foreign Prime Minister. Sound stupid? That's because it's supposed to be. We have a handful of male models, all of them with IQs lower than their body fat percentage, and all of them getting into situations that they are not mentally equipped for.\n\nYou can't watch "Zoolander" for its story or its characters, you can only watch it for its inane humour.

The cast is still good in their roles. Derek and Hansel are still the same characters and they play them with enthusiasm and Mugatu is well, OK. Sadly, everything else is pretty much garbage. The humor did not work at all and I just wanted it to be over. After 5 minutes of the movie I was just exhausted. This is a clear example that bigger does not mean better. I am a fan of the original Zoolander and one of the things I liked about that film is that it was just a small comedy with a relatively small budget and it evolved as a cult film. Zoolander 2 tries to be bigger than the first one and it just doesn't work. The first was pretty much about Mugatu trying to hypnotize a male model to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia. That was the plot. Stupid? Definitely, but it worked in its own right. This one's about Derek trying to locate his son, while male models are being assassinated, which actually did not pay off at all in the end. \n\nThe movie is filled with unnecessary cameos and there can be too much of a good thing. It happened last year with the Entourage movie and now with this. Like I said, everything is bigger, the scope and even the effects, but what Stiller and his production crew don't get is that what made the original Zoolander so funny and good was that it seemed like they were taking a chance. It was kind of cheap and small but it worked.\n\nThe film doesn't work at all but I'll say this: At least it didn't feel cynical. To me it seemed like they were actually trying to make a good film and a funny one but it just did not work. The humor is mostly like people getting hit in the face and stuff like that. The movie also tries way too hard to recall on things from the original that were funny. As a fan of the original and as a moviegoer in general, I would not recommend Zoolander 2. I laughed 5 times in the whole movie. I counted them.

There was a cartoonish film trilogy in the 1990s. Recently, Michael Bay produced a franchise-reboot as a live action-computer-generated motion capture film. I did not particularly like this very dark 2014 film, rating it only a 5/10. When trailers came out for this sequel though, I already saw that it looked like it was going to be a way better movie than the first one. \n\nThe turtle heroes, along with old pals April O'Neil and Vern Fenwick, and new friend Casey Jones, spring back into action as Shredder was busted from incarceration. The arch-villain had inter- galactically nefarious plans as he conspired with mad scientist Dr. Baxter Stockman to bring into Earth an evil Dimension X being called Krang and his Technodrome in his wild dream of world domination. \n\nThe way the turtles looked in this new film was way better executed. In the first one, they all looked too big, ugly and unwieldy. Their appearance now is more accessible, more in tune with their personalities. Even if the storyline will have their team tested, this was a truly excellent ensemble work among the four actors behind them, imbuing each one with individual charm. They are: Pete Ploszek (as conflicted leader Leonardo), Alan Ritchson (as muscle- bound rebel Raphael), Jeremy Howard (as brainy scientist Donatello) and Noel Fisher (as childlike spirit Michelangelo). \n\nAlso similarly excellent were the CG artwork, performance and the on screen chemistry between the two comical evil side characters, warthog Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and the rhino Rocksteady (Stephen Farrelly). They definitely stole their scenes from right under the main bad guy Shredder (Brian Tee), who felt rather lackluster among the other colorful characters of the film. The pinkish brain-like maniacal alien super-villain Krang was portrayed with gruesome glee by Brad Garrett.\n\nThe unconvincing and hammy acting of Megan Fox (as April) and Will Arnett (as Vern) were fortunately buoyed up the excellence of the CGI and story around them. Tyler Perry was an over-the-top nerd as Dr. Stockman, uncomfortably funny. Veteran acting nominee Laura Linney was uncharacteristically stiff as police chief Rebecca Vincent. The best live performer of the film was TV's "Arrow" Stephen Amell as Casey Jones. His graceful physicality (with a hockey stick and skates) and smart-alecky sense of humor made him stand out. \n\nThe look of this new film is so much better than the first one, literally "out of the shadows" where the first one wallowed. There were brighter colors, a lighter mood, a more fun throwback general feel about it. The previous one was too dark and intense, and took itself too seriously, to its own detriment. With this one, we had our beloved Turtles back to the unpretentious way we knew them in our youth. Serious critics may be hard on this one, but I really enjoyed 112 minutes with it, right up to the classic TV cartoon theme song over the closing credits.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88858,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2016-06-29","keywords":"sequel,turtle,based on cartoon,rat,brother brother relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2458694681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NTE2NjcwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1NDA4ODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NTE2NjcwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1NDA4ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Meet the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they return to save the city from a dangerous threat."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1083271/","name":"Megan Fox"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1347153/","name":"Tyler Perry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1757777/","name":"Dave Green"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0032227/","name":"Josh Appelbaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0625858/","name":"André Nemec"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0481990/","name":"Peter Laird"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>
