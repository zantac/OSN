I remember Avi Nesher said its movie don't have the traditional 3 act structure, which makes it very enjoyable in a fresh and interesting way. It was also very cool to watch a Israeli film without clichés or stereotypes, portraying their culture and millennial traditions with respect in a contemporary world. This is proof that if you want to make an incredibly fresh action film you don't need cars, explosions or serial murders. You need a good crew, you need to bring love to your work, you need courage to step outside the conventional boundaries without sacrificing the public's enjoyment. This exhales love and respect for the observer, and I really appreciate it. It's warm, it's interesting, it's new.\n\nBONUS! The song in the bar scene was BEAUTIFUL! I completely loved the quality of the sound, it was very rich and moving, even if I didn't understand a word.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-10-25","keywords":"morning ritual,netilat yadayim,airport,father daughter relationship,father son relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Other Story","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1876343833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDI0YTk5NWMtNTNlZi00NTY4LTk1MDQtMGU3NDRkMTc0ZmNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDI0YTk5NWMtNTNlZi00NTY4LTk1MDQtMGU3NDRkMTc0ZmNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0299924/","name":"Sasson Gabay"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2380472/","name":"Joy Rieger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0781879/","name":"Yuval Segal"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383605/","name":"Avi Nesher"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017558/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0707371/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10032060/","name":"Noam Shpancer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383605/","name":"Avi Nesher"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Boom! the credits. When I least expect it, 2 hours have passed, I mean, not many films have that characteristic while maintaining the highest quality in terms of screenwriting and acting. I remember Avi Nesher said its movie don't have the traditional 3 act structure, which makes it very enjoyable in a fresh and interesting way. It was also very cool to watch a Israeli film without clichés or stereotypes, portraying their culture and millennial traditions with respect in a contemporary world. This is proof that if you want to make an incredibly fresh action film you don't need cars, explosions or serial murders. You need a good crew, you need to bring love to your work, you need courage to step outside the conventional boundaries without sacrificing the public's enjoyment. This exhales love and respect for the observer, and I really appreciate it. It's warm, it's interesting, it's new.\n\nBONUS! The song in the bar scene was BEAUTIFUL! I completely loved the quality of the sound, it was very rich and moving, even if I didn't understand a word.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-10-25","keywords":"morning ritual,netilat yadayim,airport,father daughter relationship,father son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Other Story","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1876343833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDI0YTk5NWMtNTNlZi00NTY4LTk1MDQtMGU3NDRkMTc0ZmNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDI0YTk5NWMtNTNlZi00NTY4LTk1MDQtMGU3NDRkMTc0ZmNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0299924/","name":"Sasson Gabay","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2380472/","name":"Joy Rieger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0781879/","name":"Yuval Segal"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383605/","name":"Avi Nesher"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017558/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0707371/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10032060/","name":"Noam Shpancer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383605/","name":"Avi Nesher"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Costner's portrayal was very true to the actual character which, isn't that the point of having characters and using actors that can act.\n\nIn a genre that is quickly becoming based only on graphic, grotesque, shocking blood and gore sequences and predictable horror and grisly effects, this thriller is actually attractive for all the right reasons and should be enjoyed highly by those that appreciate true horror/thriller films as opposed to the blood soaked hacker/slasher movies that are being pumped out monthly.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14920,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-10-07","keywords":"mound,ant farm,indian burial ground,shotgun,father daughter relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The New Daughter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2034828313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDM1ODA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQwNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0MDM1ODA0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQwNDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A single father moves his two children to rural South Carolina, only to watch his daughter exhibit increasingly strange behavior.

Mark Felt (Liam Neeson), aka "Deep Throat," is tag lined in the movie's title as "the man who brought down the White House."

Yes, he had control of Hoover's "private files" (lots of sexual indiscretions) after his death in 1972, and he had 31 years of service. To boot, he was a straight arrow whom the dirty tricksters in the White House should have feared.\n\nSo how could this be a dull story? In the first place, the secret actions by the Watergate burglars and the foul machinations of Nixon's henchmen are barely exposed as drama. More importantly, the seminal investigative gymnastics of Woodward and Bernstein are skimmed over in favor of a Dustin Hoffman lookalike (Julian Morris) as Woodward (Redford played it in All) looking star struck when Felt begins his covert revelations. More integral is Sandy Smith (Bruce Greenwood) of Time Magazine as felt unloads info on him as well.\n\nWhile we are left with a Cliff's Notes superficial version of the events leading to Nixon's resignation, we endure the domestic dilemmas of a boozy wife (Diane Lane) disappointed that Felt was passed over for director and a missing daughter, embarrassingly attached to a commune, we find out eventually. In the latter detail rests a better story of how Felt investigated Weatherman activities with a conflict of interest angle related to his daughter. (Reagan commuted Felt's sentence for unauthorized searches).\n\nThat is to say, there is so much action in those early '70's related to Tricky Dick that the movie seems to leave behind as it gets the right angles for its many Neeson close-ups. More close-ups of the FBI activity would have been better. All the President's Men and Spotlight are far better giving you the daily details leading to their disclosures.\n\nBut, hey, it is instructive to see that 45 years ago, the FBI asserted its independence from the White House. It had a sleazy administration to buck, all the more reason to fight the good fight. If you think there is resonance today with James Comey's firing, then hope for a Deep Throat.

There are stories within these images, and sometimes they need to speak for themselves, without the aid of conventional narration or voiceover.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1012,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2020-09-09","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3691495705","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ4MTMxMWYtYzIxOC00YjY0LWE0OTAtYWY1NTY5MTVhOGNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzQ4MTMxMWYtYzIxOC00YjY0LWE0OTAtYWY1NTY5MTVhOGNkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Filmed over three years on the borders between Iraq, Kurdistan, Syria and Lebanon, Notturno captures  the  everyday  life  that  lies  behind  the  continuing  tragedy  of  civil  wars,  ferocious dictatorships, foreign invasions and the murderous apocalypse of ISIS.

I know her demeanor is quiet and conniving, but she just struts around waiting to make overly witty replies.

You knew what was going to happen before it happened and there were too many twists in the movie that they lost their affect.  Twists are good when used sparingly and when used at the right time.  I didn't like the timing of them in this movie or the overuse of them.  It got boring because the characters always pull something out of their hat when you "least expect it."\n\n For me dialogue has to be  two things, witty and believable.  Now the dialogue in this film is witty, Mamet probably took a while to compile all these quotes into one movie, but it is too much.  It is simply to much.  All Rebecca Pidgeon says is these crafty responses and she engages no real conversation.  As for believable, people don't speak like this. No one, not even the coolest cat in the world and half the time I am trying to figure out what the hell they mean.\n\n The plot is way too contrived, it is too much.  Their is a backup plan, for a backup plan, for a backup plan, for a ...  The scene on the runway was crap, impossible.  Never would have happened.

After so many dramas and pink romance, blockbusters and thrillers, horrors so far by originals and the army of remakes, "Unleashed" represents fresh air.

In fact, I adore it. For the simple motif than it is more than charming. It represents the best choice for the cat - dog owners and for the fans of romance in different form. The performances are great and the story - one of lovely crafted. Sure, it is an easy film but it has the rare gift to be, for its genre, a real gem. After so many dramas and pink romance, blockbusters and thrillers, horrors so far by originals and the army of remakes, "Unleashed" represents fresh air. For the levels of humor, for the great job of actors, for the flavor of old fashion comedy and for something who only the smile after its end could translate it. So, delightful.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1515,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2017-08-25","keywords":"cat,dog,transformation,male nudity,male rear nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unleashed","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1838070553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM4Nzc1NTktOGJlNS00MzA4LWE0YjItMmRiZTliOWE0ZGQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM4Nzc1NTktOGJlNS00MzA4LWE0YjItMmRiZTliOWE0ZGQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Unleashed","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154226/","name":"Justin Chatwin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000276/","name":"Sean Astin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0992538/","name":"Steve Howey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852363/","name":"Finn Taylor"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0491058/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852363/","name":"Finn Taylor"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

You will be hard pressed to find such awful acting anywhere as Miss Nielsen, 'veteran' director Richard Fleischer stumbles blindly through a non-existant plot, and you will feel absolutely no sympathy for either the good guys or the bad - in other words you just won't care!\n\nI would love to have hated this film - as a self-proclaimed 'movie-buff' this is the kind of film I should not even go near. But I'm loathed to admit...I enjoyed it! The two stars, amongst their awful acting, are actually quite engaging in a comedic way (intentional or not!). I began to relish the dialogue scenes just to see if a line could have been delivered with any more wood! The intentional comedy comes from a young prince (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his bodyguard (Paul Smith). Although I wished the prince to find the end of a sword as quickly as possible from his first scene, the interplay between these two characters was amusing, with some one-liners that could not have been more out of place in this film! The villainous queen (played by Sandahl Bergman) is unfortunately bland and forgettable.

You will be hard pressed to find such awful acting anywhere as Miss Nielsen, 'veteran' director Richard Fleischer stumbles blindly through a non-existant plot, and you will feel absolutely no sympathy for either the good guys or the bad - in other words you just won't care!\n\nI would love to have hated this film - as a self-proclaimed 'movie-buff' this is the kind of film I should not even go near. But I'm loathed to admit...I enjoyed it! The two stars, amongst their awful acting, are actually quite engaging in a comedic way (intentional or not!). I began to relish the dialogue scenes just to see if a line could have been delivered with any more wood! The intentional comedy comes from a young prince (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his bodyguard (Paul Smith). Although I wished the prince to find the end of a sword as quickly as possible from his first scene, the interplay between these two characters was amusing, with some one-liners that could not have been more out of place in this film! The villainous queen (played by Sandahl Bergman) is unfortunately bland and forgettable. But one real treat for me was another completely out-of-place commodity - a great rousing score from maestro Ennio Morricone!\n\nThis was Schwarzenegger's return to his CONAN genre after hitting it big with THE TERMINATOR.

So, delightful.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1515,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2017-08-25","keywords":"cat,dog,transformation,male nudity,male rear nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unleashed","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1838070553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM4Nzc1NTktOGJlNS00MzA4LWE0YjItMmRiZTliOWE0ZGQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODM4Nzc1NTktOGJlNS00MzA4LWE0YjItMmRiZTliOWE0ZGQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Unleashed","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154226/","name":"Justin Chatwin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000276/","name":"Sean Astin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0992538/","name":"Steve Howey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852363/","name":"Finn Taylor"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0491058/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852363/","name":"Finn Taylor"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Stir Of Echoes was not it. Partly due to the studio's financial difficulties, Stir Of Echoes came and went by itself, unsung and unappreciated. Which goes to show that recognition in the Hollywood system does not go to innovators or the best storytellers. It is all about marketability, and while Stir Of Echoes had this, the companies involved in making or distributing it did not seem to want to spend the cash involved in taking advantage. Either that or Artisan and Fox decided to use it as their tax write-off for that year.\n\nI have not read the novel by Richard Matheson, so I cannot comment on how faithfully the film follows its source. But that is irrelevant. When compared to its more big-name competitor, at least Stir Of Echoes has the courtesy to acknowledge its source. The film updates the story to a more modern era, thus saving a few dollars, since period pieces are expensive to make. In fact, the dramatic angle of the film keeps it rather cheap, since effects shots are few and far between. Not to mention the effects that do appear are fairly simple in nature. Indeed, Stir Of Echoes only cost about thirteen million to make, according to estimates. Which makes it all the more peculiar that Fox was unwilling to invest a little more effort in publicising the film.\n\nKevin Bacon is in fine, fine form as the film's central hero, a regular guy called Tom Witzky. Kathryn Erbe is also in great form as his wife, Maggie. Illeana Douglas is decidedly odd as his sister-in-law, Lisa. But the real surprise here is child performer Zachary David Cope. After the pretender, that pile of sachaarine garbage called The Sixth Sense, child stars had such a bad reputation that Zachary deserves a medal for portraying such a genuinely likable, layered character. Indeed, director David Koepp took one hell of a risk by placing so much of the responsibility for the plot on his shoulders. That it pays off is a testament not only to the strength of Zachary David Cope's performance, but to the strength of the material he was given. Indeed, all the best scenes in Stir Of Echoes involve interaction between Zachary, Kathryn, and Kevin.\n\nI do think this film has its faults. Chief among them is that the story needed another ten minutes to properly develop. Plot threads like the group of psychics, a member of which helps put Kathryn Erbe's character on the path of greater understanding, needed better resolution. One moment, Maggie is asking this policeman why her husband is obsessed with a scene of memories to the exclusion of his job. The next moment, not only are details like the job forgotten, so too is the group and the policeman. Smoothing out intricate plot points such as this would have helped the story no end.\n\nIn the end, however, Stir Of Echoes is proof that the artistic work one does not hear about may just be the one that has more merit.

Stir Of Echoes was not it. Partly due to the studio's financial difficulties, Stir Of Echoes came and went by itself, unsung and unappreciated. Which goes to show that recognition in the Hollywood system does not go to innovators or the best storytellers. It is all about marketability, and while Stir Of Echoes had this, the companies involved in making or distributing it did not seem to want to spend the cash involved in taking advantage. Either that or Artisan and Fox decided to use it as their tax write-off for that year.\n\nI have not read the novel by Richard Matheson, so I cannot comment on how faithfully the film follows its source. But that is irrelevant. When compared to its more big-name competitor, at least Stir Of Echoes has the courtesy to acknowledge its source. The film updates the story to a more modern era, thus saving a few dollars, since period pieces are expensive to make. In fact, the dramatic angle of the film keeps it rather cheap, since effects shots are few and far between. Not to mention the effects that do appear are fairly simple in nature. Indeed, Stir Of Echoes only cost about thirteen million to make, according to estimates. Which makes it all the more peculiar that Fox was unwilling to invest a little more effort in publicising the film.\n\nKevin Bacon is in fine, fine form as the film's central hero, a regular guy called Tom Witzky. Kathryn Erbe is also in great form as his wife, Maggie. Illeana Douglas is decidedly odd as his sister-in-law, Lisa. But the real surprise here is child performer Zachary David Cope. After the pretender, that pile of sachaarine garbage called The Sixth Sense, child stars had such a bad reputation that Zachary deserves a medal for portraying such a genuinely likable, layered character. Indeed, director David Koepp took one hell of a risk by placing so much of the responsibility for the plot on his shoulders. That it pays off is a testament not only to the strength of Zachary David Cope's performance, but to the strength of the material he was given. Indeed, all the best scenes in Stir Of Echoes involve interaction between Zachary, Kathryn, and Kevin.\n\nI do think this film has its faults. Chief among them is that the story needed another ten minutes to properly develop. Plot threads like the group of psychics, a member of which helps put Kathryn Erbe's character on the path of greater understanding, needed better resolution. One moment, Maggie is asking this policeman why her husband is obsessed with a scene of memories to the exclusion of his job. The next moment, not only are details like the job forgotten, so too is the group and the policeman. Smoothing out intricate plot points such as this would have helped the story no end.\n\nIn the end, however, Stir Of Echoes is proof that the artistic work one does not hear about may just be the one that has more merit. If nothing else, it is worth watching to see a small ensemble cast that excels. Even small performances like Liza Weil's demonstrate a sense of dramatic flair that has long fled most of the rest of Hollywood. It is for this reason that I gave Stir Of Echoes an eight out of ten. It is worth watching just to see how badly misdirected the hype machine often is.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":79328,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1999-09-10","keywords":"hypnosis,seeing a ghost,missing person,psychic power,haunted house","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stir of Echoes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1653276953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAyMjM3ODEtYzA4Yi00NGM0LWI5YzctYWYwNTIxMDg5YWEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAyMjM3ODEtYzA4Yi00NGM0LWI5YzctYWYwNTIxMDg5YWEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000102/","name":"Kevin Bacon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0178574/","name":"Zachary David Cope","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002062/","name":"Kathryn Erbe"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014903/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0558577/","name":"Richard Matheson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0462895/","name":"David Koepp"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The action in this film is unbelievable and grim. I found myself not wanting the story to end. Many of the movies based on superheroes in a comic book tend not to sticks gritty and real. This one was and then some. The movie has surpassed my expectation and I certainly look forward Punisher 2.\n\nThe next film sets itself up for a kick butt start. They should take a page from X2 or the Lethal Weapon series and just open the next film with a wild battle. You can grab the viewer right away and still tell your full story right after. I hope the entire cast as well as the director returns because they crafted one quality origin story here. In summary, I enjoyed everything about this dark tale.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":155338,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2004-05-05","keywords":"vigilante,revenge,family reunion,female nudity,origin of hero","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Punisher (2004)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4236444185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg1ZWIyNGQtMjdkNy00YjkzLWE3MDEtZWM0YjYxM2VlMmFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg1ZWIyNGQtMjdkNy00YjkzLWE3MDEtZWM0YjYxM2VlMmFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this film based on the Marvel comic book character","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005048/","name":"Thomas Jane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000526/","name":"Samantha Mathis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378144/","name":"Jonathan Hensleigh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060306/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092570/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378144/","name":"Jonathan Hensleigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0289833/","name":"Michael France"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Boy, was I surprised. This is a wonderful film, not at all the low-level fluff film I expected. All the female actresses, young and old, are absolutely terrific, and Adam Sandler does a respectable job in a semi-serious role.

The guy has been in every(I think) Highlander movie so far, despite the fact that only the first was particularly popular. He's done so many B-movies that one has to wonder if he is aware that the films are bad and doesn't care, or if he really doesn't realize their quality(or, rather, lack thereof). Here, he returns in a sequel to the fairly low-budget B-movie action-science fiction flick, Fortress. In the first one, the prison was huge, and underneath the ground. Here, it's... well, it's still huge, but this time, it's in outer space. I guess the writer thought, hey, the first time, it was underneath the ground... the only place that could be worse than that would be outer space. I hope he's right... I surely do, because if he is, maybe we won't see anymore half-cooked action-sci-fi flicks like this. Lambert portrays the exact same character, which I suppose is good, as he was a decent character in the first. A few somewhat big names also join the cast, most noticeably Pam Grier. The cast of characters from the first are pretty much remade(apart from Lambert himself), meaning that the new cast pretty much just fills the shoes of the characters from the first(anyone who knows how the first ended knows why). Unfortunately, that means that the film seems more like an overblown remake with the same guy portraying the lead, rather than a sequel. The hacker from the first(who was a neurotic, nervous guy, beautifully portrayed by great horror-talent, Jeffrey Combs) is replaced by an annoying black-guy stereotype. The female lead is replaced by a girl from the resistance(which Lambert's character is said to be a member of as well... odd... I don't remember that from the first... does that mean he joined the resistance after he got a kid? Who'd do that?), instead of his wife as it was in the first... apparently mainly because the scriptwriter couldn't find a good way to capture both Lambert and the wife-character, without capturing the kid. The Men-Tel prison commander(who was played by the cool bad-guy actor, Kurtwood Smith, from RoboCop fame) is now an annoying wimp with a ridiculous British accent that really gets on your nerves(as opposed to the cool Smith, who was a menacing and threatening presence). The plot is a rehash of the first. The pacing isn't particularly good. The very scenes in the movie seems to be(for the most part) remakes of the scenes of the original(talk about lack of originality...) and the action is mostly just rehashes of the first, just made a little less exciting(remember those way-cool machine guns with three barrels in the first? They're replaced with dull futuristic-looking stick-stun-guns). The special effects are decent at best. The script is a weak rehash of the first, with a few added sub-plots, none of which being particularly good... most of them are just there to keep the film going, or put it an action scene, in order to distract the audience from the poor writing. The dialog is pretty bad, with one or two exceptions. All in all, the film is just a tame rehash of everything the first was(which isn't even a lot). Somebody took the first film, said, "hey, this is popular... but it's not very good... how about if we try to do something of even lesser quality and see if people will like it?" Probably writer/producer/actor John Flock, who, going by the plot and the writing of this film, really is as dumb as he looks. I recommend this only to huge fans of the first Fortress, Lambert or B-movies. Everyone else; don't bother. There's a million better ways to spend 90 minutes, and there's at least as many reasons not to see this film. 5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6871,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2000-03-02","keywords":"punishment,dome,breasts,buttocks,female frontal nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fortress 2: Re-Entry","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1424294169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWZkNGZlZjAtZTE3Yi00OWZkLTgxNDYtMGZiN2I1NTI0YzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWZkNGZlZjAtZTE3Yi00OWZkLTgxNDYtMGZiN2I1NTI0YzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from TriStar Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000483/","name":"Christopher Lambert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0869728/","name":"Beth Toussaint"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308606/","name":"Willie Garson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614276/","name":"Geoff Murphy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048299/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058145/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270686/","name":"Steven Feinberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0624639/","name":"Troy Neighbors"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0282472/","name":"John Flock"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The guy has been in every(I think) Highlander movie so far, despite the fact that only the first was particularly popular. He's done so many B-movies that one has to wonder if he is aware that the films are bad and doesn't care, or if he really doesn't realize their quality(or, rather, lack thereof). Here, he returns in a sequel to the fairly low-budget B-movie action-science fiction flick, Fortress. In the first one, the prison was huge, and underneath the ground. Here, it's... well, it's still huge, but this time, it's in outer space. I guess the writer thought, hey, the first time, it was underneath the ground... the only place that could be worse than that would be outer space. I hope he's right... I surely do, because if he is, maybe we won't see anymore half-cooked action-sci-fi flicks like this.

The guy has been in every(I think) Highlander movie so far, despite the fact that only the first was particularly popular. He's done so many B-movies that one has to wonder if he is aware that the films are bad and doesn't care, or if he really doesn't realize their quality(or, rather, lack thereof). Here, he returns in a sequel to the fairly low-budget B-movie action-science fiction flick, Fortress. In the first one, the prison was huge, and underneath the ground. Here, it's... well, it's still huge, but this time, it's in outer space. I guess the writer thought, hey, the first time, it was underneath the ground... the only place that could be worse than that would be outer space. I hope he's right... I surely do, because if he is, maybe we won't see anymore half-cooked action-sci-fi flicks like this. Lambert portrays the exact same character, which I suppose is good, as he was a decent character in the first. A few somewhat big names also join the cast, most noticeably Pam Grier. The cast of characters from the first are pretty much remade(apart from Lambert himself), meaning that the new cast pretty much just fills the shoes of the characters from the first(anyone who knows how the first ended knows why). Unfortunately, that means that the film seems more like an overblown remake with the same guy portraying the lead, rather than a sequel. The hacker from the first(who was a neurotic, nervous guy, beautifully portrayed by great horror-talent, Jeffrey Combs) is replaced by an annoying black-guy stereotype. The female lead is replaced by a girl from the resistance(which Lambert's character is said to be a member of as well... odd... I don't remember that from the first... does that mean he joined the resistance after he got a kid? Who'd do that?), instead of his wife as it was in the first... apparently mainly because the scriptwriter couldn't find a good way to capture both Lambert and the wife-character, without capturing the kid. The Men-Tel prison commander(who was played by the cool bad-guy actor, Kurtwood Smith, from RoboCop fame) is now an annoying wimp with a ridiculous British accent that really gets on your nerves(as opposed to the cool Smith, who was a menacing and threatening presence). The plot is a rehash of the first. The pacing isn't particularly good. The very scenes in the movie seems to be(for the most part) remakes of the scenes of the original(talk about lack of originality...) and the action is mostly just rehashes of the first, just made a little less exciting(remember those way-cool machine guns with three barrels in the first? They're replaced with dull futuristic-looking stick-stun-guns). The special effects are decent at best. The script is a weak rehash of the first, with a few added sub-plots, none of which being particularly good... most of them are just there to keep the film going, or put it an action scene, in order to distract the audience from the poor writing. The dialog is pretty bad, with one or two exceptions. All in all, the film is just a tame rehash of everything the first was(which isn't even a lot). Somebody took the first film, said, "hey, this is popular... but it's not very good... how about if we try to do something of even lesser quality and see if people will like it?" Probably writer/producer/actor John Flock, who, going by the plot and the writing of this film, really is as dumb as he looks. I recommend this only to huge fans of the first Fortress, Lambert or B-movies. Everyone else; don't bother.

After all, Sandler's usual man-child character had to have somebody that he could relate to. Sandler portrays Sonny Koufax, a man who just might be the pure epitome of somebody who's not responsible. However, if that theory wasn't tested then there would be no film. In an effort to possibly win back his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) who has left him because of his being irresponsible and has since taken up with another man, he offers to be a guardian for his traveling roommate's (Jon Stewart) son, Julian (portrayed by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse). Agreeing to assume full responsibility for a child makes Sonny think that Swanson just might change her mind about leaving him. It doesn't happen and now child services won't let him return Julian. Sonny learns to grin and bear the situation by attempting to bond with Julian and in so doing, he gradually begins to feel more like an actual responsible father figure. Of course things get complicated when Stewart eventually returns home and a custody battle begins (Julian has grown attached to Sonny by this time). Even this dramatic seeming scene evolves into more adolescent comedy. Sandler's fans should enjoy this film but since I was never especially a fan of Sandler, I consider it to be just another crumbled up piece of paper in the sorry recent film comedy wastebasket."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":208500,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1999-06-25","keywords":"responsibility,new york city,immaturity,adoption,hooters waitress","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Big Daddy","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi979346457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ZjZjZDAtNzFmZS00YzM3LWIzYzAtOThhZTU0NTA0YmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ZjZjZDAtNzFmZS00YzM3LWIzYzAtOThhZTU0NTA0YmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Big Daddy"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000725/","name":"Joey Lauren Adams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829537/","name":"Jon Stewart"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064748/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052395/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291692/","name":"Steve Franks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379056/","name":"Tim Herlihy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After all, Sandler's usual man-child character had to have somebody that he could relate to. Sandler portrays Sonny Koufax, a man who just might be the pure epitome of somebody who's not responsible. However, if that theory wasn't tested then there would be no film. In an effort to possibly win back his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) who has left him because of his being irresponsible and has since taken up with another man, he offers to be a guardian for his traveling roommate's (Jon Stewart) son, Julian (portrayed by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse). Agreeing to assume full responsibility for a child makes Sonny think that Swanson just might change her mind about leaving him. It doesn't happen and now child services won't let him return Julian. Sonny learns to grin and bear the situation by attempting to bond with Julian and in so doing, he gradually begins to feel more like an actual responsible father figure. Of course things get complicated when Stewart eventually returns home and a custody battle begins (Julian has grown attached to Sonny by this time). Even this dramatic seeming scene evolves into more adolescent comedy. Sandler's fans should enjoy this film but since I was never especially a fan of Sandler, I consider it to be just another crumbled up piece of paper in the sorry recent film comedy wastebasket.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":208500,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1999-06-25","keywords":"responsibility,new york city,immaturity,adoption,hooters waitress","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Big Daddy","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi979346457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ZjZjZDAtNzFmZS00YzM3LWIzYzAtOThhZTU0NTA0YmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ZjZjZDAtNzFmZS00YzM3LWIzYzAtOThhZTU0NTA0YmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Big Daddy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000725/","name":"Joey Lauren Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829537/","name":"Jon Stewart"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064748/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052395/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291692/","name":"Steve Franks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379056/","name":"Tim Herlihy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

It has a lot less.\n\nIt's one of those movies that would have been great in 1998. But falls short in 2008.

Stupid. It might have you grabbing your sides in 98', but when you watch it, its somewhat like, "OK, let me guess, Rob Schneider is going to pop up and say something dumb with a 'pause for laughter' moment?" Yup.\n\nIs Sandler going to do a stupid voice the whole movie and end on a 'touching theme'?. Yup.\n\nActing is good, I will give it that. However, if you have seen any Adam Sandler movie, then you won't be surprised with his acting choices.

It has a lot less.\n\nIt's one of those movies that would have been great in 1998. But falls short in 2008. Its just the same gimmick that has been done by 'Happy Madison Productions'.\n\nReminds me of: Chuck and Larry, Strange Wilderness, The Benchwarmers, Dickie Roberts, 50 first dates, Etc.\n\nIt's just well.....for lack of a better word. Stupid. It might have you grabbing your sides in 98', but when you watch it, its somewhat like, "OK, let me guess, Rob Schneider is going to pop up and say something dumb with a 'pause for laughter' moment?" Yup.\n\nIs Sandler going to do a stupid voice the whole movie and end on a 'touching theme'?. Yup.\n\nActing is good, I will give it that. However, if you have seen any Adam Sandler movie, then you won't be surprised with his acting choices. Same choices, different accent.\n\nNothing against Sandler, his movies were great.......in 98'\n\nI'd wait for DVD,...if that.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":196592,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-06-06","keywords":"hair stylist,palestinian,funny arab,arab israeli conflict,super strength","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"You Don't Mess with the Zohan","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1625489689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNjA5NjEwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEwODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwNjA5NjEwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTEwODYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"You Don't Mess with the Zohan - 30 second spot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001806/","name":"John Turturro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004825/","name":"Emmanuelle Chriqui"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0806912/","name":"Robert Smigel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I wanted to see another one but since he was visiting I agreed with his choice, and was surprised to find myself liking the film very much. OK, the script could be a little better, but the direction and acting were very good, even down to the supporting players such as the actors who portrayed the two NYC cops who assist the main character, Interpol agent Sallinger (Clive Owens), once the story moved to NYC. What I particularly liked was the way the story was told cinematically rather than through a lot of verbose dialogue. It seemed to me like a Bourne thriller for adults. No kinetic hand-held camera action, but smooth visually appealing cinematic exposition the way Hitchcock did it in his prime. Even the closing credits were used effectively to give a rather downbeat dénouement to the film.\n\nIn short, an entertaining movie that alleviated the February blues.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94142,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-02-18","keywords":"interpol,money laundering,post punk,lyon france,milan italy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The International: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi815137561","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzAxOTMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0MDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzAxOTMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0MDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Interpol Agent Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) and Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) pool their resources in an attempt to break up an international arms dealing ring financed by a high-profile bank."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000090/","name":"Armin Mueller-Stahl"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028338/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2545235/","name":"Eric Warren Singer"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I wanted to see another one but since he was visiting I agreed with his choice, and was surprised to find myself liking the film very much. OK, the script could be a little better, but the direction and acting were very good, even down to the supporting players such as the actors who portrayed the two NYC cops who assist the main character, Interpol agent Sallinger (Clive Owens), once the story moved to NYC. What I particularly liked was the way the story was told cinematically rather than through a lot of verbose dialogue. It seemed to me like a Bourne thriller for adults. No kinetic hand-held camera action, but smooth visually appealing cinematic exposition the way Hitchcock did it in his prime. Even the closing credits were used effectively to give a rather downbeat dénouement to the film.\n\nIn short, an entertaining movie that alleviated the February blues.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94142,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-02-18","keywords":"interpol,money laundering,post punk,lyon france,milan italy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The International: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi815137561","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzAxOTMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0MDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMzAxOTMzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTU0MDIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Interpol Agent Louis Salinger (Clive Owen) and Manhattan Assistant District Attorney Eleanor Whitman (Naomi Watts) pool their resources in an attempt to break up an international arms dealing ring financed by a high-profile bank.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000090/","name":"Armin Mueller-Stahl"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0878756/","name":"Tom Tykwer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028338/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2545235/","name":"Eric Warren Singer"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.\n\nI thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.\n\nBottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).\n\nIf you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels).

 --- Description: The Dark Tower: Directed by Nikolaj Arcel. With Matthew McConaughey, Idris Elba, Tom Taylor, Dennis Haysbert.

It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.\n\nI thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.\n\nBottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).\n\nIf you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time.

What I like the most about Crowe's work, is that everything is real. The characters, their emotions, the story,  The whole is absolutely amazing.\n\nTom Cruise gave an excellent performance as the sports agent with a heart. Someone for who money isn't the most important thing. It's all about the relationship between the sports agent and his client. What's so great about "Jerry Maguire", is the fact that the movie isn't about who Jerry Maguire really is, it's about who he wants to be. I loved Cuba Gooding Jr. By far his greatest role ever. Let's not forget Renée Zellweger and her cute son, amazingly performed by the young Jonathan Lipnicki. Both where very good. Perfect casting for Zellweger.\n\nI read in the trivia that the title role was written for Tom Hanks. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, but to play an ambitious and arrogant sports manager (what Jerry Maguire was at the beginning of the movie), you need to have Tom Cruise's face. He was just perfect for the role. I can't think of anybody who could have done this as good as he did.\n\nSo my conclusion for Jerry Maguire: If you haven't seen it, you should definitely see it. If you have seen it, I hope you can agree with me. This movie is wonderful, as where are used from Cameron Crowe-movies.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1996-12-13","keywords":"agent,sports agent,football,football player,reference to shaquille o'neal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Jerry Maguire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2527247897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E4YTVlYjgtZDk5My00MDk1LThlMjEtMzVlZTcxYmZmYWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E4YTVlYjgtZDk5My00MDk1LThlMjEtMzVlZTcxYmZmYWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000421/","name":"Cuba Gooding Jr."},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001081/","name":"Cameron Crowe"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035761/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001081/","name":"Cameron Crowe"}],"duration":"PT2H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Perfect casting for Zellweger.\n\nI read in the trivia that the title role was written for Tom Hanks. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, but to play an ambitious and arrogant sports manager (what Jerry Maguire was at the beginning of the movie), you need to have Tom Cruise's face. He was just perfect for the role. I can't think of anybody who could have done this as good as he did.\n\nSo my conclusion for Jerry Maguire: If you haven't seen it, you should definitely see it. If you have seen it, I hope you can agree with me. This movie is wonderful, as where are used from Cameron Crowe-movies.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1996-12-13","keywords":"agent,sports agent,football,football player,reference to shaquille o'neal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Jerry Maguire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2527247897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E4YTVlYjgtZDk5My00MDk1LThlMjEtMzVlZTcxYmZmYWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E4YTVlYjgtZDk5My00MDk1LThlMjEtMzVlZTcxYmZmYWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000421/","name":"Cuba Gooding Jr.","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001081/","name":"Cameron Crowe"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035761/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001081/","name":"Cameron Crowe"],"duration":"PT2H19M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

What I like the most about Crowe's work, is that everything is real. The characters, their emotions, the story,  The whole is absolutely amazing.\n\nTom Cruise gave an excellent performance as the sports agent with a heart. Someone for who money isn't the most important thing. It's all about the relationship between the sports agent and his client. What's so great about "Jerry Maguire", is the fact that the movie isn't about who Jerry Maguire really is, it's about who he wants to be. I loved Cuba Gooding Jr. By far his greatest role ever. Let's not forget Renée Zellweger and her cute son, amazingly performed by the young Jonathan Lipnicki. Both where very good. Perfect casting for Zellweger.\n\nI read in the trivia that the title role was written for Tom Hanks. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, but to play an ambitious and arrogant sports manager (what Jerry Maguire was at the beginning of the movie), you need to have Tom Cruise's face. He was just perfect for the role. I can't think of anybody who could have done this as good as he did.\n\nSo my conclusion for Jerry Maguire: If you haven't seen it, you should definitely see it. If you have seen it, I hope you can agree with me.

 --- Description: Jerry Maguire: Directed by Cameron Crowe. With Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr., Renée Zellweger, Kelly Preston.

Maybe even more! As I already said in the title of my review, only Cameron Crowe can make this kind of movies. Movies about life the way it is and life the way it should be. What I like the most about Crowe's work, is that everything is real. The characters, their emotions, the story,  The whole is absolutely amazing.\n\nTom Cruise gave an excellent performance as the sports agent with a heart. Someone for who money isn't the most important thing. It's all about the relationship between the sports agent and his client. What's so great about "Jerry Maguire", is the fact that the movie isn't about who Jerry Maguire really is, it's about who he wants to be. I loved Cuba Gooding Jr. By far his greatest role ever. Let's not forget Renée Zellweger and her cute son, amazingly performed by the young Jonathan Lipnicki. Both where very good. Perfect casting for Zellweger.\n\nI read in the trivia that the title role was written for Tom Hanks. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, but to play an ambitious and arrogant sports manager (what Jerry Maguire was at the beginning of the movie), you need to have Tom Cruise's face. He was just perfect for the role. I can't think of anybody who could have done this as good as he did.\n\nSo my conclusion for Jerry Maguire: If you haven't seen it, you should definitely see it. If you have seen it, I hope you can agree with me. This movie is wonderful, as where are used from Cameron Crowe-movies.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1996-12-13","keywords":"agent,sports agent,football,football player,reference to shaquille o'neal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Jerry Maguire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2527247897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E4YTVlYjgtZDk5My00MDk1LThlMjEtMzVlZTcxYmZmYWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E4YTVlYjgtZDk5My00MDk1LThlMjEtMzVlZTcxYmZmYWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000421/","name":"Cuba Gooding Jr.","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001081/","name":"Cameron Crowe"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035761/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001081/","name":"Cameron Crowe"],"duration":"PT2H19M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Russell's Crunch Calhoun and Matt Dillon's half-brother Nicky do one last heist, a thriller mainstay that promises much will go wrong before the denouement. Writer- director Jonathan Sobol's double-crosses and cocky hooligans last to the twisted end for a real "last" one. \n\nWith Jay Baruchel playing the greenhorn, and therefore the vulnerable part of the plan, fun ensues as he questions the sanity of the plan's convoluted steps. Even more fun is watching a deadpan Terence Stamp play a federal informer whose British accent and considerable knowledge of art inform every suspenseful moment with the exotic, the cultural, and the dangerous. \n\nPart of the joy is trying to figure out where his character fits in with the lawful and the unlawful. Not happy, however, is the over-the-top reactions of Jason Jones' Interpol agent, Bick. Blame director Jonathan Sobol for not seeing the chasm between this sophomoric performance and Stamp's nuanced turn.\n\nKurt Russell has been in showbiz for at least a half century, and while his face shows some wear, his actorly sensibilities are sharply delivered in a film whose comic moments and frequent plot twists offer a brief respite in a waning but still ornery winter."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24258,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-06-20","keywords":"heist,thief,motorcycle,hiding in a car trunk,interpol","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Art of the Steal","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1849604633","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjk4OTE0OWUtODYyNS00MmYzLWJmNjYtZmZiNGI4ZTU1MWZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjk4OTE0OWUtODYyNS00MmYzLWJmNjYtZmZiNGI4ZTU1MWZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Art of the Steal"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000621/","name":"Kurt Russell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059431/","name":"Jay Baruchel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935395/","name":"Katheryn Winnick"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1038286/","name":"Jonathan Sobol"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026545/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1038286/","name":"Jonathan Sobol"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Russell's Crunch Calhoun and Matt Dillon's half-brother Nicky do one last heist, a thriller mainstay that promises much will go wrong before the denouement. Writer- director Jonathan Sobol's double-crosses and cocky hooligans last to the twisted end for a real "last" one. \n\nWith Jay Baruchel playing the greenhorn, and therefore the vulnerable part of the plan, fun ensues as he questions the sanity of the plan's convoluted steps. Even more fun is watching a deadpan Terence Stamp play a federal informer whose British accent and considerable knowledge of art inform every suspenseful moment with the exotic, the cultural, and the dangerous. \n\nPart of the joy is trying to figure out where his character fits in with the lawful and the unlawful. Not happy, however, is the over-the-top reactions of Jason Jones' Interpol agent, Bick. Blame director Jonathan Sobol for not seeing the chasm between this sophomoric performance and Stamp's nuanced turn.\n\nKurt Russell has been in showbiz for at least a half century, and while his face shows some wear, his actorly sensibilities are sharply delivered in a film whose comic moments and frequent plot twists offer a brief respite in a waning but still ornery winter.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24258,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-06-20","keywords":"heist,thief,motorcycle,hiding in a car trunk,interpol","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Art of the Steal","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1849604633","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjk4OTE0OWUtODYyNS00MmYzLWJmNjYtZmZiNGI4ZTU1MWZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjk4OTE0OWUtODYyNS00MmYzLWJmNjYtZmZiNGI4ZTU1MWZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Art of the Steal","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000621/","name":"Kurt Russell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059431/","name":"Jay Baruchel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935395/","name":"Katheryn Winnick"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1038286/","name":"Jonathan Sobol"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026545/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1038286/","name":"Jonathan Sobol"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

There is a lot of stories and emotions connected to the making of this project. The journey surely was not an easy ride for the polish animator who lost his long-time friend and music collaborator Tadeusz Nalepa during the process.\n\nBriefly to the plot, I would say it as a mixture of dreams and memories of Wilczynski's upbringing in the industrial town of Lodz in the 60's and 70s during the dehumanization of life under Communist Poland. The filmmaker himself is part of the play and appears as an obese nude giant and recalls his parents and the socio-political situation in the communist Poland. The story places us in the disturbed head of our protagonist and we see his surreal version of the timeline and slowly descending into madness. From the very first frames, a surreal delirium of suggestions and the symbolic predominates over the laws of rationality. The narrative is reflected visually and metaphorically, and it succeeds in creating such disturbing experience with the scribbly style has an aesthetic at its best. Even the morbid images of human pet, ugly streets, the autopsy, bloody beaked birds, junk sea and the ship contain a right balance and it is not overdone just for the gore quotient. In addition, the music is staged for the surreal effect, stands on its own and manages to set the right accents. Also, I was surprised to see the voice for the old man in the train with the newspaper was done by late Andrzej Wajda.\n\nFinal thoughts, the film is a nightmare that gets under your skin visually and plays deep into the consciousness. I would say the film clearly owes a debt to David Lynch and this is not to criticise or say that I didn't love the experience. I did and it was Lynchian, sometimes it reminded me of demo tapes album art from 90s grindcore bands, a little of Ujichaa, little of David Shrigley or Roland Topor, and some Bill Plympton vibes all mixed into one that in several places is close to the grotesque and beautiful. To the fans who possess a love for surrealism and adore the aforementioned artists, check it out I highly recommend that you do so.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":695,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"genre":["Animation","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-03-05","keywords":"hero","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi642563609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlNmYyMDItYjdmNS00NTJmLTkyYWQtNTNjM2RkMTFkNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlNmYyMDItYjdmNS00NTJmLTkyYWQtNTNjM2RkMTFkNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417370/","name":"Krystyna Janda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161607/","name":"Andrzej Chyra"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652292/","name":"Maja Ostaszewska"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1295507/","name":"Mariusz Wilczynski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0799710/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0723136/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0704662/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1295507/","name":"Mariusz Wilczynski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1294751/","name":"Agnieszka Scibior"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The journey surely was not an easy ride for the polish animator who lost his long-time friend and music collaborator Tadeusz Nalepa during the process.\n\nBriefly to the plot, I would say it as a mixture of dreams and memories of Wilczynski's upbringing in the industrial town of Lodz in the 60's and 70s during the dehumanization of life under Communist Poland. The filmmaker himself is part of the play and appears as an obese nude giant and recalls his parents and the socio-political situation in the communist Poland. The story places us in the disturbed head of our protagonist and we see his surreal version of the timeline and slowly descending into madness. From the very first frames, a surreal delirium of suggestions and the symbolic predominates over the laws of rationality. The narrative is reflected visually and metaphorically, and it succeeds in creating such disturbing experience with the scribbly style has an aesthetic at its best. Even the morbid images of human pet, ugly streets, the autopsy, bloody beaked birds, junk sea and the ship contain a right balance and it is not overdone just for the gore quotient. In addition, the music is staged for the surreal effect, stands on its own and manages to set the right accents. Also, I was surprised to see the voice for the old man in the train with the newspaper was done by late Andrzej Wajda.\n\nFinal thoughts, the film is a nightmare that gets under your skin visually and plays deep into the consciousness. I would say the film clearly owes a debt to David Lynch and this is not to criticise or say that I didn't love the experience. I did and it was Lynchian, sometimes it reminded me of demo tapes album art from 90s grindcore bands, a little of Ujichaa, little of David Shrigley or Roland Topor, and some Bill Plympton vibes all mixed into one that in several places is close to the grotesque and beautiful. To the fans who possess a love for surrealism and adore the aforementioned artists, check it out I highly recommend that you do so.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":695,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"genre":["Animation","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-03-05","keywords":"hero","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi642563609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlNmYyMDItYjdmNS00NTJmLTkyYWQtNTNjM2RkMTFkNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlNmYyMDItYjdmNS00NTJmLTkyYWQtNTNjM2RkMTFkNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417370/","name":"Krystyna Janda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161607/","name":"Andrzej Chyra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652292/","name":"Maja Ostaszewska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1295507/","name":"Mariusz Wilczynski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0799710/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0723136/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0704662/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1295507/","name":"Mariusz Wilczynski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1294751/","name":"Agnieszka Scibior"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B.

They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.\n\nFantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.\n\nWhen they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.\n\nThe story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie.

Conversely, it's refreshing and inspiring to know that a young woman has been able to mobilise such a strong and powerful force to fight against the intransigence and/or misinformation pedalled primarily by biased middle aged and older men; although this is primarily a documentary about a person and not a movement.

It's not the most original or best film out there, but it was a romantic and beautiful story that was very delightful to watch. The characters were charming, the acting was decent, the music was fun, and the message was meaningful. It might be a little to cute/sappy/chick flick for some, but it is an enjoyable and touching film IMHO!

This particular story is very reminiscent to Mike Flanagan's style where he places just as much importance into the heart and soul of the characters as the amount of detail in the creepy creatures or hauntings. It's definitely a great and promising first feature effort from Jacob Chase.\n\nThe film still does have its classic clichés with many predictable timed jump scares and the all too common tech themes of late , but it still wraps everything together nicely with some interesting concepts. There are some tremendous moments of authentic emotion portrayed by the main actors as well which is an underrated aspect especially in horror films. There's also a very interesting entity with a great backstory with some decent enough CGI to present it. The atmosphere and tension is prevalent and there are some clever camera choices.\n\nOverall it's way better than many will think it will be after seeing the very cliche trailer, and people shouldn't take it for just a kids horror. If this is the one wide release horror film we get for Halloween, it does serve its purpose well enough.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11086,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-10-30","keywords":"based on short film,cell phone,monster,parking lot,seperated parents","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2498674969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3ZThhYzgtMWMyZS00Nzg5LWE0MTctZjAzYjM0YmE1NDZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3ZThhYzgtMWMyZS00Nzg5LWE0MTctZjAzYjM0YmE1NDZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A monster named Larry that manifests itself through smart phones and mobile devices.

This particular story is very reminiscent to Mike Flanagan's style where he places just as much importance into the heart and soul of the characters as the amount of detail in the creepy creatures or hauntings. It's definitely a great and promising first feature effort from Jacob Chase.\n\nThe film still does have its classic clichés with many predictable timed jump scares and the all too common tech themes of late , but it still wraps everything together nicely with some interesting concepts. There are some tremendous moments of authentic emotion portrayed by the main actors as well which is an underrated aspect especially in horror films. There's also a very interesting entity with a great backstory with some decent enough CGI to present it. The atmosphere and tension is prevalent and there are some clever camera choices.\n\nOverall it's way better than many will think it will be after seeing the very cliche trailer, and people shouldn't take it for just a kids horror. If this is the one wide release horror film we get for Halloween, it does serve its purpose well enough.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11086,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-10-30","keywords":"based on short film,cell phone,monster,parking lot,seperated parents","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2498674969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3ZThhYzgtMWMyZS00Nzg5LWE0MTctZjAzYjM0YmE1NDZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3ZThhYzgtMWMyZS00Nzg5LWE0MTctZjAzYjM0YmE1NDZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A monster named Larry that manifests itself through smart phones and mobile devices.

What this move does not show is that at that time Attorney General, now deceased Lech Kaczynski had been urged that a killer is found and sentenced to silence medias hysteria and coverage about brutal murder and rape of that young girl. Later when the murder was put on Tomasz, he was publicly defamed by Lech Kaczynski. Despite Mr L. Kaczynski death in Smolensk plane crash and after Tomasz was exonerated, no polish public institution nor police have never apologized Tomasz for their actions, which is a standard practice in western democratic countries.\n\nNot much changed in post-soviet bloc however after 1990 in terms of judiciary mentality. Human Rights Watch estimates that 1-3% of sentences in Poland may be those in which innocent people are sentenced just because either suspects were threatened by police to force to confess by beatings. No effective police control and their procedures exists as of today. You may call it a mafia or not but I believe it's not far from truth in Poland.\n\nPersonally I believe his family did not do enough to get him out of prison, a good lawyer would smash the case easily and he is worth every money, why did it happen 15 years later is a mystery for me.\n\nAs Tomasz said after his release, there are no good people in prisons , there is only evil.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":884,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-18","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3825975/","name":"Piotr Trojan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0474492/","name":"Agata Kulesza"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2621963/","name":"Dariusz Chojnacki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1450132/","name":"Jan Holoubek"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015575/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0185099/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1733303/","name":"Andrzej Golda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1450132/","name":"Jan Holoubek"}],"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What this move does not show is that at that time Attorney General, now deceased Lech Kaczynski had been urged that a killer is found and sentenced to silence medias hysteria and coverage about brutal murder and rape of that young girl. Later when the murder was put on Tomasz, he was publicly defamed by Lech Kaczynski. Despite Mr L. Kaczynski death in Smolensk plane crash and after Tomasz was exonerated, no polish public institution nor police have never apologized Tomasz for their actions, which is a standard practice in western democratic countries.\n\nNot much changed in post-soviet bloc however after 1990 in terms of judiciary mentality. Human Rights Watch estimates that 1-3% of sentences in Poland may be those in which innocent people are sentenced just because either suspects were threatened by police to force to confess by beatings. No effective police control and their procedures exists as of today. You may call it a mafia or not but I believe it's not far from truth in Poland.\n\nPersonally I believe his family did not do enough to get him out of prison, a good lawyer would smash the case easily and he is worth every money, why did it happen 15 years later is a mystery for me.\n\nAs Tomasz said after his release, there are no good people in prisons , there is only evil.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":884,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-18","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3825975/","name":"Piotr Trojan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0474492/","name":"Agata Kulesza","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2621963/","name":"Dariusz Chojnacki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1450132/","name":"Jan Holoubek"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015575/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0185099/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1733303/","name":"Andrzej Golda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1450132/","name":"Jan Holoubek"],"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Producer of numerous Wajda's films including KATYN, Michal Kwiecinski in a witty directorial venture, EXTRAS, explores how modern men think of surrendering to Chinese Wave and drowning in its vast sea, when there's nothing left in his homeland, but a wasteland! A big yes to EXTRAS (2006) and its Homage to Love and Happy Ending! However in this enthusiastic farce, most of deductions seem absurd - for instance it is clear that if the Chinese director announces that, "Poland is second China and China is second Poland", the Polish photographer replies, "The situation is not good in Poland!!!" The absurdity is resonated in the duologue's of the melodrama they're shooting. The alienated Polish characters and enhancement of their relationship during the work are phenomenally inspiring, but the Chinese stereotypes - especially the childish director with his beloved goldfish - are not convincing at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-10-27","keywords":"town","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695835/","name":"Kinga Preis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115711/","name":"Stanislaw Brudny"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452609/","name":"Krzysztof Kiersznowski"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477187/","name":"Michal Kwiecinski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034872/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1008161/","name":"Jaroslaw Sokól"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Producer of numerous Wajda's films including KATYN, Michal Kwiecinski in a witty directorial venture, EXTRAS, explores how modern men think of surrendering to Chinese Wave and drowning in its vast sea, when there's nothing left in his homeland, but a wasteland! A big yes to EXTRAS (2006) and its Homage to Love and Happy Ending! However in this enthusiastic farce, most of deductions seem absurd - for instance it is clear that if the Chinese director announces that, "Poland is second China and China is second Poland", the Polish photographer replies, "The situation is not good in Poland!!!" The absurdity is resonated in the duologue's of the melodrama they're shooting. The alienated Polish characters and enhancement of their relationship during the work are phenomenally inspiring, but the Chinese stereotypes - especially the childish director with his beloved goldfish - are not convincing at all.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-10-27","keywords":"town","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695835/","name":"Kinga Preis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115711/","name":"Stanislaw Brudny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452609/","name":"Krzysztof Kiersznowski"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477187/","name":"Michal Kwiecinski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034872/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1008161/","name":"Jaroslaw Sokól"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

But experienced writer and director David Ayer failed miserably with his screenplay on what could've and should've been. I've seen amateur writers have tighter, more fluid, and logical screenplays. And it's a shame, because it really didn't need that much effort to fix. A few adjustments here and there, and/or better editing. Everything else was perfection.\n\nCasting and performances - especially LaBeouf, were so convincing, you felt it. Cinematography and score were flawless. Even Ayer's directing was decent, although the "good" scenes needed more/better/longer takes. But Geoffrey O'Brien's editing was horrible, and with the convoluted choppy screenplay, is what failed this film.\n\nI can't stand long films, especially when the story drags out, but I was left begging this screenplay had more much needed content and clarity in it, without taking out any of the current scenes. Another 20 mins added to the current 95 min runtime would have complimented and completed this little gem. Such a waste of everything else that was perfect.\n\nNevertheless, I am still shocked by the low ratings and bad reviews. I can only subtract 2 stars out of 10 for the horrible editing and lacking screenplay, because this could've easily been a perfect 10/10. So sadly, best it deserves is 8/10, because even with it's flaws, it's still one of the better films I've seen in a long time."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11920,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-08-07","keywords":"street,tattoo,gun,tax,tax collector","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1931263513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIwZjE1YmEtNGM1Zi00MDc0LWEwOTUtNzUyYmYyMmI2ZWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIwZjE1YmEtNGM1Zi00MDc0LWEwOTUtNzUyYmYyMmI2ZWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"David (Bobby Soto) and Creeper (Shia LaBeouf), are "tax collectors" for the crime lord Wizard, collecting his cut from the profits of local gangs' illicit dealings.

But experienced writer and director David Ayer failed miserably with his screenplay on what could've and should've been. I've seen amateur writers have tighter, more fluid, and logical screenplays. And it's a shame, because it really didn't need that much effort to fix. A few adjustments here and there, and/or better editing. Everything else was perfection.\n\nCasting and performances - especially LaBeouf, were so convincing, you felt it. Cinematography and score were flawless. Even Ayer's directing was decent, although the "good" scenes needed more/better/longer takes. But Geoffrey O'Brien's editing was horrible, and with the convoluted choppy screenplay, is what failed this film.\n\nI can't stand long films, especially when the story drags out, but I was left begging this screenplay had more much needed content and clarity in it, without taking out any of the current scenes. Another 20 mins added to the current 95 min runtime would have complimented and completed this little gem. Such a waste of everything else that was perfect.\n\nNevertheless, I am still shocked by the low ratings and bad reviews. I can only subtract 2 stars out of 10 for the horrible editing and lacking screenplay, because this could've easily been a perfect 10/10. So sadly, best it deserves is 8/10, because even with it's flaws, it's still one of the better films I've seen in a long time.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11920,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-08-07","keywords":"street,tattoo,gun,tax,tax collector","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1931263513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIwZjE1YmEtNGM1Zi00MDc0LWEwOTUtNzUyYmYyMmI2ZWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIwZjE1YmEtNGM1Zi00MDc0LWEwOTUtNzUyYmYyMmI2ZWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"David (Bobby Soto) and Creeper (Shia LaBeouf), are "tax collectors" for the crime lord Wizard, collecting his cut from the profits of local gangs' illicit dealings.

The story is very fascinating. It is the story of a family that goes to a special house for a vacation. Theo is suspected of killing his ex-wife. The movie is well-made. Most of the story is happening in the house. In my opinion, the director could benefit from more locations. The background noise and music were awesome.

He is talented and he has a lot of experience. So, he was a very good choice for a complicated character like Theo. Also, I saw nice acting from Avery Tiiu Essex (Theo's daughter). She is talented. The story is very fascinating. It is the story of a family that goes to a special house for a vacation. Theo is suspected of killing his ex-wife. The movie is well-made. Most of the story is happening in the house. In my opinion, the director could benefit from more locations. The background noise and music were awesome. I liked the movements of the camera and the angles of the camera in different scenes. In summary, I recommend watching this movie to horror fans.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-06-18","keywords":"nightmare,spatial loop,drowning,husband wife relationship,father daughter relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi238927385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTc4ODE4ZjEtYjJmNS00YjU3LWFkMzgtN2QyY2M3NDgyMGY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTc4ODE4ZjEtYjJmNS00YjU3LWFkMzgtN2QyY2M3NDgyMGY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theo Conroy is a successful middle-aged man whose marriage to his  actress wife, Susanna, is shredding at the seams, frayed by her secretiveness, his jealousy, and the shadow of his past. \n\nIn an effort to repair their relationship, Theo and Susanna book a vacation at a stunning, remote modern home in the Welsh countryside for themselves and their six-year-old daughter, Ella.

Certainly, the backdrop of a small town and monastery both removes the story from Polish film of the second half of the twentieth century (most films involve one of the two cultural capitals or another prominent city such as Lodz) and tied it to Polish history and tradition (village life and the relationship o the Catholic Church to secular culture share this film's conceptual center). In addition to this, the content and themes in Jasminum interweave with those previously taken up by other Polish directors, most notably the theme of artist and artistic attitudes existing in conflict with religion and politics (addressed by Wajda in Man of Marble and engaged even in such blockbuster classics as Da Vinci) and the motif of broken or frustrated love and philosophical estrangement.\n\nIt is true that in Jasminum Kolski gives these topics a fresh airing, reinvigorating them with a slightly off-kilter, quirky narrative point of view and an enchanting cast (though Linda might have been better employed in a more demanding role). Everything from the botanically derived names of the candidates for sainthood down to the cinematographic details of verbal and visual perspective (the chiaroscuro lighting, music in the underground vault scene and knowing 'but-not-supposed-to-know' childishness of the narrator's commentary) adds to the eclectic atmosphere of this love drama. And whether Kolski was successful or not in pulling in off, a love drama it was apparently meant to be.\n\nThe film's preoccupation with smell would seem to provide some clue as to the director's essential vision of this tale of love. The heroine (whose tale is, charmingly, told by her daughter) discover piece by piece the secrets of the saints of older days and even of the monks currently living in the cloister. Birdcherry, Plum, Roch--finally, jasmine, the very 'heart' of love, as we find out along with Natasha--all provide the scent-addicted ladies of the town with something so essential they seem unable to bear life without it. What magic do these fragrances conceal, making them so seductive? It would seem they offer their wearers a certain distillation of the life-force itself, an irresistible attractiveness, self-confidence and perhaps most of all a renewed sense of life's possibilities. They transform reality in accordance with the wearer's will in the concentrations appropriate not to weakness but to saintly strength, fortitude and charity.\n\nHowever, in the end it is the humblest of the monks--Sanitas--who, though tempted by the glory in a new pair of glossy boots, cherished his relationship with little Eugenia, the narrator, and with other small, helpless creatures above all else. While each of the monks is portrayed sympathetically through Kolski's lens (even Birdcherry, the source of Natasha's bitterness), the most penetrating and genuinely touching aspect of this narrative is the growing attachment between an old man and a little girl who, it turns out, have more in common than each originally believes.\n\nThe mother--the ostensible heroine, as she is verbally depicted by Eugenia--has her own tale, forming a second stratum of the film's treatment of love. Hers is a story of disappointment and bitterness distilled over time, and it is only slightly mitigated through her meeting with her runaway fiancée. While Natasha's unwillingness to place her own trust in a love potion (as does her own disciple) and consequent search for 'oblivion' in another concoction reveal her veiled motivation for working in the cloister, they also complicate and add a sense of authenticity to her character.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with the online review that bravely call the movie 'weak'--in the sense that what at heart is meant to be a love story is to a great extent undermined by the secondary plot involving Boleslaw Linda. In the layer of Kolski's message love is portrayed exclusively as sex without much elaboration, forcing Linda and his stage partner into somewhat superficial roles. Even if by this Kolski is merely attempting to represent various attitudes to love and the way individuals are taken by surprise, he fails to provide the internal logic of the rapidly-developing and 'out of the blue' relationship that evidently blossoms into marital bliss.\n\nWhile Jasminum's atmosphere is engaging and the plot thought-provoking, I ultimately find it a mite contrived and more than a little bit mystifying. I would like to see this very deservingly popular director channel his energies towards even more of these 'modern fairy tales' (bajki), provided he remains faithful to the human reality as well...meaning, just as many fantastic oddities but alongside them a more nuanced and carefully handled human component."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1280,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-05-05","keywords":"voice over narration,woman beater,sex,scent,runaway groom","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2702136/","name":"Justyna Bartoszewicz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0088111/","name":"Grazyna Blecka-Kolska"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196449/","name":"Marta Dabrowska"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464383/","name":"Jan Jakub Kolski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004670/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464383/","name":"Jan Jakub Kolski"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In it what can be cured with a simple apology, yet out of arrogance escalates into a hellish nightmare as the woman's whole life becomes a target of the man's rage. Out of technicality, the plot is quite simple with few logical gaps. with that in mind and aside from the ridiculously bad choices which the female lead makes across the whole movie not to mention her passive boring personality...Yet with a raw chilling performance from Russell Crowe who owned the aggression and hate of his role, he single handedly managed to elevate the movie to a notable level of thrills, entertainment and excitement. The director succeeds in painting some interesting surprises in the car chase scenes and an over all thrilling experience that is worth watching.\n\nUnlike some views, I experienced this movie from a different point of view, to me the whole idea revolves around the concept of decency and common courtesy among mankind that most of us lost, maybe the fake bubble of freedom and personal rights that we live our daily lives in or how awfully some were raised on a fake racist patriotism which believes that a certain nationality/race is above others or or or. All are false reasons to be rude, mistreat others or lose compassion and courtesy for one another. Either you watch Unhinged for the thrilling entertainment or for the eye opening message the results is quite satisfying on both ends."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":59311,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-07-31","keywords":"stabbed in the eye with scissors,driving,road rage,psychopath,stalking","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3319512601","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA2MWY5ZGQtNmZkNS00NzFiLTlhNTYtMWJmMzA2ZDVlNDYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA2MWY5ZGQtNmZkNS00NzFiLTlhNTYtMWJmMzA2ZDVlNDYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Academy Award winner Russell Crowe stars in a timely psychological thriller that explores the fragile balance of a society pushed to the edge, taking something we’ve all experienced — road rage — to an unpredictable and terrifying conclusion."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3308569/","name":"Caren Pistorius"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5145655/","name":"Gabriel Bateman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0097517/","name":"Derrick Borte"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0784470/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0531993/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0716530/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0255296/","name":"Carl Ellsworth"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In it what can be cured with a simple apology, yet out of arrogance escalates into a hellish nightmare as the woman's whole life becomes a target of the man's rage. Out of technicality, the plot is quite simple with few logical gaps. with that in mind and aside from the ridiculously bad choices which the female lead makes across the whole movie not to mention her passive boring personality...Yet with a raw chilling performance from Russell Crowe who owned the aggression and hate of his role, he single handedly managed to elevate the movie to a notable level of thrills, entertainment and excitement. The director succeeds in painting some interesting surprises in the car chase scenes and an over all thrilling experience that is worth watching.\n\nUnlike some views, I experienced this movie from a different point of view, to me the whole idea revolves around the concept of decency and common courtesy among mankind that most of us lost, maybe the fake bubble of freedom and personal rights that we live our daily lives in or how awfully some were raised on a fake racist patriotism which believes that a certain nationality/race is above others or or or. All are false reasons to be rude, mistreat others or lose compassion and courtesy for one another. Either you watch Unhinged for the thrilling entertainment or for the eye opening message the results is quite satisfying on both ends.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":59311,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-07-31","keywords":"stabbed in the eye with scissors,driving,road rage,psychopath,stalking","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3319512601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA2MWY5ZGQtNmZkNS00NzFiLTlhNTYtMWJmMzA2ZDVlNDYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA2MWY5ZGQtNmZkNS00NzFiLTlhNTYtMWJmMzA2ZDVlNDYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Academy Award winner Russell Crowe stars in a timely psychological thriller that explores the fragile balance of a society pushed to the edge, taking something we’ve all experienced — road rage — to an unpredictable and terrifying conclusion.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3308569/","name":"Caren Pistorius","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5145655/","name":"Gabriel Bateman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0097517/","name":"Derrick Borte"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0784470/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0531993/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0716530/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0255296/","name":"Carl Ellsworth"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

This means that along with the beautiful autumn colors that emerge, the spooky season of Halloween also returns. Along with the jack o' lanterns, fun size candy, and parities, this is also when the often popular haunts come to town. These haunts cater to those that want something genuinely scary, as if they've stepped into their favorite horror movies...without the serial killers of course. I've only been to a few and have had more laughs then fears. This is because I more appreciate the haunts in a similar way a stage show is pulled off. \n\nSo why are there dedicated fans that keep going further with mazes where they tough you (yes, they can do that)? Again, it's a part of the Halloween atmosphere that a part of the escapism people desire. We already know were going to survive the night, but we love to see if our internal suspension of disbelief can activate and put us in the fear we want. I can understand it can be too intense for a lot of people, but again, it's all a part of the season. It's nice to see a movie like Hell Fest to set a slasher within a haunt park.\n\nA young college student Natalie (Played by Amy Forsyth) is visiting her former roommate Brooke (played by Reign Edwards) and classmate Taylor (played by Bex Taylor-Klaus). Not only are they going to the haunt park Hell Fest, but their meeting up with friends, including Gavin (played by Robby Attal) who got everyone V.I.P. passes (which means no line waiting). Along with the various people coming in, they see that Hell Fest of full of scare actors, several mazes to explore and even an entire land called "the Deadlands" where the actors are allowed to touch and go further with their scares. \n\nThe problem? An unnamed person enters the park and into the mazes and starts randomly killing off guests. Our heroes don't see anything wrong until this guy acquires a mask and starts to stalk them around. At first they dismiss him as a really good actor, but when friends start disappearing, they got more uneasy. Even when they try talking to security (who tells them that he can arrest someone for doing their job), they don't seem to have a lot of options. The further they get to the Deadlands, the more they feel like they've descended into hell.\n\nSo by reading this, you can already tell that Hell Fest follows a lot of slasher tropes that we've seen before; the group of college kids, unresponsive authority, walking along somewhere, killer with a mask, and such. This will definitely not appeal to those looking for a new kind of horror movie (like Hereditary). This seems to be more proud that it's trying to be a typical slasher. Because of that, I didn't mind it. A lot of it has to do with it's setting and atmosphere.\n\nHell Fest is full of theme park-like Halloween imagery that looks really cool. I was afraid they would try to pull off haunt mazes that only Hollywood effects teams were capable of. Instead, each maze has the right balance of over the top gory, but also over the top fakery. This feels like something that would be built at Knott's Berry Farm or Universal Studios. Part of me really wants to visit this place...without the killing of course. Even the scare actors seems spot on with some coming up to them at random points, and some in full makeup hosting scary shows about guillotines.\n\nStory is minimal as the what's served is an excuse to show off the park. The main actors like Amy Forsyth and Bex Taylor-Klaus do fine in their parts. Their interesting enough that we'd want to visit the park with them. Even when they are eventually chased by the killer (I swear, I don't even think they gave him a name), we do want to see them survive. Also like a lot of slashers, without giving anything away, it does tease for a potential sequel in a trope manner we've seen before. I'd, however, would love to see this continue.\n\nI'll give this seven tickets to Knott's Scary Farm out of ten. Hell Fest may be a typical slasher, but it's so atmospheric, that those that have been to these haunts will probably like it fine. It's hard to phrase it or be critical as it's also short, running no more then eighty-five minutes. It's a fun watch. So see it and understand it's all a prt of the show.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16182,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-09-28","keywords":"amusement park,haunted house attraction,masked killer,slasher,group of friends","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Band Teaser Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1220655897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3YzNhYWEtMTc4ZS00OTE3LTkzMDMtY2NlODlhMTc2NmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3YzNhYWEtMTc4ZS00OTE3LTkzMDMtY2NlODlhMTc2NmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A masked serial killer turns a horror themed amusement park into his own personal playground, terrorizing a group of friends while the rest of the patrons believe that it is all part of the show."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6407242/","name":"Cynthea Mercado"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4806678/","name":"Stephen Conroy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5046593/","name":"Amy Forsyth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687427/","name":"Gregory Plotkin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047306/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164393/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092570/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3466037/","name":"Seth M.

He stumbles upon a hidden fortress, where he comes face to face with Otto Von Walrus (John Cleese), a blubbery evil genius, who walks around on mechanical legs and commands a loyal army of oddly polite puffin henchmen. Swifty soon discovers Otto Von Walrus' plan to drill beneath Arctic surface to unleash enough ancient gas to melt the Arctic, in order to reign as the world's supreme leader. Now, Swifty has to enlist the help of his friends: PB (Alec Baldwin), an introverted polar bear, Lemmy (James Franco), a scatterbrained albatross, Jade Fox (Heidi Klum), a tough as nails mechanic, Leopold (Omar Sy) and Bertha (Heidi Klum), two conspiracy theorist otters and Magda (Anjelica Huston), the curmudgeonly boss. This ragtag group of Arctic misfits has to band together to stop Otto Von Walrus' sinister plans and save the day.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0719637/","name":"Jeremy Renner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005099/","name":"Heidi Klum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005616/","name":"Aaron Woodley"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0478960/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0587902/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0561881/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1779809/","name":"Bob Barlen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2117510/","name":"Cal Brunker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2474213/","name":"Matthew Lyon"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The X-Files will forever be remembered as a true hit TV show, and a breakout accomplishment for Fox. Its survived cast changes, location moves, ups and downs in ratings, and years of airing. I think I speak for everyone when I say that it has been a thrill. Chris Carter has created one of the most defining shows of the '90s. People that don't even watch the show know what it is, and EVERYONE knows who Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are, whether they've ever seen one episode or not. The show brought on a whole new level of TV entertainment in 1993, with its different, moody atmosphere, intriguing lead characters, and mind-bending plots. I admit, while watching most of the episodes, I thought, "This isn't very scary...", but then I payed attention to the detail and it got so good...the lighting, the sets...even when Mulder and Scully are outside (which is often), the sky is hardly ever sunny and bright, but rather dark and shadowy. The details on these things are terrific alone. And Chris Carter has also managed to create intense torture for the fans by forever dragging out the "Mulder and Scully in love" idea. People used to tune in to see when those two would kiss, and they had alot of fun with that, especially in the feature film. But a true sign of integrity for the show is the amount of truth in it. While the show is about the paranormal, and truth in it seems ironic, the show knows what the heck it's talking about. Every word from Scully's mouth is based on actual science. And unlike other FBI shows, The X-Files shows the FBI like it really is--not some tired cliche, but REAL people.

The X-Files will forever be remembered as a true hit TV show, and a breakout accomplishment for Fox. Its survived cast changes, location moves, ups and downs in ratings, and years of airing. I think I speak for everyone when I say that it has been a thrill. Chris Carter has created one of the most defining shows of the '90s. People that don't even watch the show know what it is, and EVERYONE knows who Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are, whether they've ever seen one episode or not. The show brought on a whole new level of TV entertainment in 1993, with its different, moody atmosphere, intriguing lead characters, and mind-bending plots. I admit, while watching most of the episodes, I thought, "This isn't very scary...", but then I payed attention to the detail and it got so good...the lighting, the sets...even when Mulder and Scully are outside (which is often), the sky is hardly ever sunny and bright, but rather dark and shadowy. The details on these things are terrific alone. And Chris Carter has also managed to create intense torture for the fans by forever dragging out the "Mulder and Scully in love" idea. People used to tune in to see when those two would kiss, and they had alot of fun with that, especially in the feature film. But a true sign of integrity for the show is the amount of truth in it. While the show is about the paranormal, and truth in it seems ironic, the show knows what the heck it's talking about. Every word from Scully's mouth is based on actual science. And unlike other FBI shows, The X-Files shows the FBI like it really is--not some tired cliche, but REAL people. And whenever someone, whether a fan or not, hears anything referring to aliens, they immediately think of little green men with small bodies, big heads, and large eyes...all courtesy of The X-Files. In short, this amazing television series has affected so many people. I feel blessed to have grown up with this show, rather than being born after it, doomed to see it in reruns.

I'm not against sequels mind you, but in most kids series seldom is any sequel as good as the first installment. This is the case for this past weekend's release starring the ever wacky Ben Stiller and his posse of celebrities. Yes my friends we take another trip back to the museum, for another hopefully fun adventure amidst it's hallowed halls. So sit back and read a late review of another Night at the Museum, the Secret of the Tomb. \n\nLikes: One thing I have always liked with this series is the selection of exhibits they choose to bring to life, and the integration of their personalities. This installment brings the magic early on, bringing back familiar faces like Teddy (Robin Williams), Jed (Owen Wilson), and Octavius (Steve Coogan) in all their comedic glory. Amidst a grand speech, cool CGI effects are put into effect to bring the constellations alive that shine in all their cool blue light before chaos arises. Once we get to the London museum, more exciting things come alive, in the form of another CGI fossil, a mythical snake demon made of metal, and the warrior with golden locks Lancelot (Dan Stevens). The effects are fluid, the designs beautiful, and when actually integrated into the movie, more on that later, you get the fun feeling you got in the first movie. Unfortunately most of these objects are background, aimlessly wandering around the scene while the big boys come out to play. \n\nOutside of the special effects there are some fun pokes at human society's obsessions, especially at internet videos, pop culture, and of course ridiculous habits that celebrities have. Some of these jokes are well timed, often delivered in a manner that is quite funny. However, many of the jokes, as happens most of the time, lose their charm and the lack of any witty humor makes it pretty much just mindless rambling that kids will only enjoy. Oh sure it's cute, but Hollywood needs to learn that more isn't necessary funnier, in fact it's the opposite. However, audiences allow them to get away with it, so what is the use in complaining. \n\nNow past funny, this Night at the Museum has another emotional side to it, helping to teach the moral lesson of moving on in the magical theatrical way. With the use of orchestrated symphony work, well angled camera shots, decent writing, and of course great acting, I'll admit I got that tingly feeling all over. No it's not gas, but those looking for a life lesson reminder will get it in this film, and a decent closing to the series  I think. As for acting, well Stiller gets the most screen time on this one. The verdict, it's alright  when he's not acting like a buffoon, and the man has some surprising agility and giant snake battle skills. Most of the time he is a bumbling idiot, but given enough time he can pull out some other feelings that we saw in Meet the Parents. As for Williams, may he rest in peace, the man gave one brilliant performance despite his character being diluted from its previous glory. \n\nDislikes: A lot in this category for this reviewer. It starts with the adventure, which in the third installment has been diluted to a rushed set of sequences, hastily edited together to get out in time for Christmas. A shame since the tale had promise of suspense, timing, and mystery that could have tied so many things together. Instead, the story lacked any depth, quickly revealing the secret without so much a trial, a challenge, or even an argument, it was just handed right to them and a rather lame story as well. In addition, a lot of the suspense was missing in this film, with only an irregular decay in the tablet's magic threatening our heroes. Speaking of which the cavalcade also lost their spunk, the strong willed character reduced to comedic boobs, some of which hardly utter a line, as Ben Stiller takes center stage. Such a shame indeed, but your kids will get a kick out of the simplistic journey, that is if they can sit in there seats  which some chose not to. \n\nInstead the adventure was put aside for  comedy, or what passed for it in this movie. Yes there were a few zingers at first, but they quickly were lost to stupid rants of ridiculous arguing with his caveman doppleganger, stupid exchange of words with exhibits, and some rather awkward discussions with Rebel Wilson. Sure it happens once or twice I can handle it, but it just kept happening, even at the big, exciting climax, with the lame bad guy. Why can these films not realize the limits of tired jokes? I can't answer it either, but sadly it took away from the movie. Perhaps this comedy was the reason why the characters were also a shell of their former glory, and why they were pretty much background characters with the new exhibits. Even the normally cute dynamic between father and son was bad, Hollywood choosing to make the son another lame teenager like most movies do. Is it accurate? Probably, but in a movie with magical tablets you would think a little magic could spread to the humans as well. \n\nI'm not going to lie, this movie failed me on many levels, and disappointed me for the grand conclusion. Still, it is a cute film that kids will handle, and still holds a little of the spark that got me into the series. Worth a trip to the theater? Not really, but if you wish to pay homage to a few of the stars I wouldn't blame you. My scores for this film are: \n\nAdventure/Comedy/Family: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114583,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2014-12-17","keywords":"night watchman,museum of natural history manhattan new york city,star died before release,museum,tablet","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4060720921","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzEzMzcwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAxMzI0MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzEzMzcwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAxMzI0MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Larry leaves New York City for London, where he unites favorite and new characters while embarking on a quest to save the magic before it is gone forever."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158853/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295296/","name":"Mark Friedman"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm not against sequels mind you, but in most kids series seldom is any sequel as good as the first installment. This is the case for this past weekend's release starring the ever wacky Ben Stiller and his posse of celebrities. Yes my friends we take another trip back to the museum, for another hopefully fun adventure amidst it's hallowed halls. So sit back and read a late review of another Night at the Museum, the Secret of the Tomb. \n\nLikes: One thing I have always liked with this series is the selection of exhibits they choose to bring to life, and the integration of their personalities. This installment brings the magic early on, bringing back familiar faces like Teddy (Robin Williams), Jed (Owen Wilson), and Octavius (Steve Coogan) in all their comedic glory. Amidst a grand speech, cool CGI effects are put into effect to bring the constellations alive that shine in all their cool blue light before chaos arises. Once we get to the London museum, more exciting things come alive, in the form of another CGI fossil, a mythical snake demon made of metal, and the warrior with golden locks Lancelot (Dan Stevens). The effects are fluid, the designs beautiful, and when actually integrated into the movie, more on that later, you get the fun feeling you got in the first movie. Unfortunately most of these objects are background, aimlessly wandering around the scene while the big boys come out to play. \n\nOutside of the special effects there are some fun pokes at human society's obsessions, especially at internet videos, pop culture, and of course ridiculous habits that celebrities have. Some of these jokes are well timed, often delivered in a manner that is quite funny. However, many of the jokes, as happens most of the time, lose their charm and the lack of any witty humor makes it pretty much just mindless rambling that kids will only enjoy. Oh sure it's cute, but Hollywood needs to learn that more isn't necessary funnier, in fact it's the opposite. However, audiences allow them to get away with it, so what is the use in complaining. \n\nNow past funny, this Night at the Museum has another emotional side to it, helping to teach the moral lesson of moving on in the magical theatrical way. With the use of orchestrated symphony work, well angled camera shots, decent writing, and of course great acting, I'll admit I got that tingly feeling all over. No it's not gas, but those looking for a life lesson reminder will get it in this film, and a decent closing to the series  I think. As for acting, well Stiller gets the most screen time on this one. The verdict, it's alright  when he's not acting like a buffoon, and the man has some surprising agility and giant snake battle skills. Most of the time he is a bumbling idiot, but given enough time he can pull out some other feelings that we saw in Meet the Parents. As for Williams, may he rest in peace, the man gave one brilliant performance despite his character being diluted from its previous glory. \n\nDislikes: A lot in this category for this reviewer. It starts with the adventure, which in the third installment has been diluted to a rushed set of sequences, hastily edited together to get out in time for Christmas. A shame since the tale had promise of suspense, timing, and mystery that could have tied so many things together. Instead, the story lacked any depth, quickly revealing the secret without so much a trial, a challenge, or even an argument, it was just handed right to them and a rather lame story as well. In addition, a lot of the suspense was missing in this film, with only an irregular decay in the tablet's magic threatening our heroes. Speaking of which the cavalcade also lost their spunk, the strong willed character reduced to comedic boobs, some of which hardly utter a line, as Ben Stiller takes center stage. Such a shame indeed, but your kids will get a kick out of the simplistic journey, that is if they can sit in there seats  which some chose not to. \n\nInstead the adventure was put aside for  comedy, or what passed for it in this movie. Yes there were a few zingers at first, but they quickly were lost to stupid rants of ridiculous arguing with his caveman doppleganger, stupid exchange of words with exhibits, and some rather awkward discussions with Rebel Wilson. Sure it happens once or twice I can handle it, but it just kept happening, even at the big, exciting climax, with the lame bad guy. Why can these films not realize the limits of tired jokes? I can't answer it either, but sadly it took away from the movie. Perhaps this comedy was the reason why the characters were also a shell of their former glory, and why they were pretty much background characters with the new exhibits. Even the normally cute dynamic between father and son was bad, Hollywood choosing to make the son another lame teenager like most movies do. Is it accurate? Probably, but in a movie with magical tablets you would think a little magic could spread to the humans as well. \n\nI'm not going to lie, this movie failed me on many levels, and disappointed me for the grand conclusion. Still, it is a cute film that kids will handle, and still holds a little of the spark that got me into the series. Worth a trip to the theater? Not really, but if you wish to pay homage to a few of the stars I wouldn't blame you. My scores for this film are: \n\nAdventure/Comedy/Family: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114583,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2014-12-17","keywords":"night watchman,museum of natural history manhattan new york city,star died before release,museum,tablet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4060720921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzEzMzcwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAxMzI0MzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzEzMzcwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAxMzI0MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Larry leaves New York City for London, where he unites favorite and new characters while embarking on a quest to save the magic before it is gone forever.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158853/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295296/","name":"Mark Friedman"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The first episode was just great, relatable and made me instantly want to buy her biography or memoir. Can't wait for more. History like this just fascinates me. I even read books on women hero's of World War Two because I feel like they are so underrepresented but are so inspiring and important in their own way.

In this case it is the boy who returns to the small town, but the girl is still uptight - only mildly, and it is her that has the folksy job. Horrendously predictable with the the expected conflict, but the conflict happened later on and wasn't nearly as bad as expected. In a way I liked having a film that just followed a relationship without too much conflict. It gave a sense of realism to how relationships usually progress. Watch this on it is sweet. The trivia says that the two leads at the time were engaged and you can see the realism in their chemistry which was nice - and also without the wince knowing one or both of the actors are married to someone else in real life.

In this case it is the boy who returns to the small town, but the girl is still uptight - only mildly, and it is her that has the folksy job. Horrendously predictable with the the expected conflict, but the conflict happened later on and wasn't nearly as bad as expected. In a way I liked having a film that just followed a relationship without too much conflict. It gave a sense of realism to how relationships usually progress. Watch this on it is sweet. The trivia says that the two leads at the time were engaged and you can see the realism in their chemistry which was nice - and also without the wince knowing one or both of the actors are married to someone else in real life. (Maybe I am weird, but I did do that while watching a different rom com last night.)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":186,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2021-04-28","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"One of a Kind Love","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1855701017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRiMjYxYWItNzdmNy00YTk3LWIyYjktYjg3ZDNiMTk2YWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmRiMjYxYWItNzdmNy00YTk3LWIyYjktYjg3ZDNiMTk2YWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Romance/Comedy TV Movie\nStarring Jocelyne Hudon","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6749397/","name":"Jocelyn Hudon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4889489/","name":"Jake Manley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8544044/","name":"Daniela Sandiford"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3560439/","name":"Philippe Lupien"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099956/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0228741/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1672013/","name":"Barbara Kymlicka"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.\n\nWhen they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.\n\nThe story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.\n\nThen there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.\n\nFantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.\n\nVisually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2191662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.\n\nVisually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2191662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I actually thought it was better than Ian Fleming's novel (quite a few of the movies adapted from his books are better than them, in my opinion). I thought it started out pretty well but it did kind of lose steam by the end in my opinion.\n\nI liked Christopher Lee and Maud Adams. Roger Moore's my favorite Bond but I didn't like him here as much as in just about all his other movies. Britt Ekland was okay but not great. And I'm usually easily pleased by most Bond girls (I actually liked Tanya Roberts's character in A View to a Kill).\n\nThe climax was pretty disappointing. The fight between Bond and Scaramanga should have gone on longer. The flying car was kind of dumb. And I thought it was kind of pointless to have Sheriff J.W. Pepper in this movie. And I was kind of hoping he'd meet that kid somehow and give him the 20,000 bahts (it is a Roger Moore Bond movie, after all, so it's not like it would have been an unbelievable coincidence).\n\nOverall, it wasn't wonderful but not that bad either.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":101467,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1974-12-20","keywords":"secret agent,official james bond series,assassin,mission,female martial artist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2754854681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FkOGI3NTMtMWQ3Ny00ZjIyLWE1NzYtZDYyZjE2NDc3MDQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FkOGI3NTMtMWQ3Ny00ZjIyLWE1NzYtZDYyZjE2NDc3MDQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000549/","name":"Roger Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000489/","name":"Christopher Lee"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001180/","name":"Britt Ekland"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542539/","name":"Tom Mankiewicz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I actually thought it was better than Ian Fleming's novel (quite a few of the movies adapted from his books are better than them, in my opinion). I thought it started out pretty well but it did kind of lose steam by the end in my opinion.\n\nI liked Christopher Lee and Maud Adams. Roger Moore's my favorite Bond but I didn't like him here as much as in just about all his other movies. Britt Ekland was okay but not great. And I'm usually easily pleased by most Bond girls (I actually liked Tanya Roberts's character in A View to a Kill).\n\nThe climax was pretty disappointing. The fight between Bond and Scaramanga should have gone on longer. The flying car was kind of dumb. And I thought it was kind of pointless to have Sheriff J.W. Pepper in this movie. And I was kind of hoping he'd meet that kid somehow and give him the 20,000 bahts (it is a Roger Moore Bond movie, after all, so it's not like it would have been an unbelievable coincidence).\n\nOverall, it wasn't wonderful but not that bad either.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":101467,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1974-12-20","keywords":"secret agent,official james bond series,assassin,mission,female martial artist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2754854681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FkOGI3NTMtMWQ3Ny00ZjIyLWE1NzYtZDYyZjE2NDc3MDQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FkOGI3NTMtMWQ3Ny00ZjIyLWE1NzYtZDYyZjE2NDc3MDQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000549/","name":"Roger Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000489/","name":"Christopher Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001180/","name":"Britt Ekland"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542539/","name":"Tom Mankiewicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

In addition , there appears the usual as Lois Maxwell, ¨MoneyPenny¨ , Minister of Defense as Geoffrey Keen and Walter Goetell as Russian general .\n\nThe picture contains comic-strip adventure , sensational pursuits , silly set pieces, great stunts, tongue-in check humor, automovile chase, frantic unstopped action , an impressive tour over razor-sharp coral reefs, amazing gimmicks and stimulating images like are the happenings on the spectacular pursuits on the snow, the overwhelming underwater scenes, and the breathtaking battles . As is like a roller-coaster , as is fast-paced, light, excitement, funny and entertaining ; it's a winner for oo7 fans and non-fans alike . The chase and suspense formula wears strong in this entry .The action-packed includes , exciting underwater fights, and cliffhanging assault of a rousing mountaintop fortress filmed in Meteoro monastery .Enjoyable title song by Sheena Easton and stirring musical score fitting to action by Bill Conti (Rocky saga's composer) ,following the John Barry's classic style . Riveting and fancy main titles by habitual Maurice Binder , furthermore eye-popping production design by Peter Lamont. It's brimming with colorful and fascinating cinematography by cameraman Alan Hume . The motion picture produced by habitual producers, Albert R Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson , being professionally made by John Glenn who filmed various outings and previously directed 2nd unit and edition on some early Bond movies . He directed several entries as ¨Licence to kill, A view to kill , For your eyes only and Octopussy¨ though with no much originality . Debuting John Glenn keeps this moving at an incredibly fast pace and this story about every's favorite super-spy falling in love with an archaeologist is one of author Ian Fleming's best . The film will appeal to James Bond series's buffs but good for fans only ; because this one goes on far too long and has provoked so much debate among 007 followers . Rating : 6'5 , well worth watching .","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":97463,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1981-06-25","keywords":"cortina italy,007,albania,blofeld's cat,official bond film","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Eyes Only","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi123601433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM3ZGZiMzctNjNhZC00YWVmLTkyZWYtNmM2MTUxZTg1YTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM3ZGZiMzctNjNhZC00YWVmLTkyZWYtNmM2MTUxZTg1YTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this James Bond classic","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000549/","name":"Roger Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000962/","name":"Carole Bouquet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0867694/","name":"Topol"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322515/","name":"John Glen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933865/","name":"Michael G.

You also cant go wrong with Amy Adams. Plus Jenna Malone if you are a fan of the amazing Neon Demon.\n\nThe story revolves around a novel containing a fairly OTT crime, but one that leaves room for visually compelling scene-setups.

He does not have a great relationship with his mum Sue, who, despite having a sunny disposition and cheery manner is also painfully unsure of herself. Daniel is hoping to spend the summer with his father who is now living in Florida but when that plan is scuppered it's clear that he's going to have to spend it with his mother.\n\nTo say this film is understated is....well, an understatement. Some reviews have seen the film as pointless and innocuous and to be fair this directorial debut by actor Simon Bird isn't going to change your life but I found a lot to like. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments a few moving ones (but not overtly sentimental) the direction and photography and the songs of Belle and Sebastian perfectly capture the bright but often deadly dull days of a suburban British summer. The supporting cast is full of great British comic actors who are great although the central performances of Earl Cave and especially Monica Dolan as son and mother are quite wonderful.\n\nYour socks won't be blown off but give yourself 85 minutes to immerse yourself into this world and you will find it, I think, a rather disarmingly charming experience.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1800,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2020-06-08","keywords":"teenager","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2582232601","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjJhMmQ4ZGQtMTc3YS00ZTlkLTk5YzQtOWU3MDg0ZjMxMTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjJhMmQ4ZGQtMTc3YS00ZTlkLTk5YzQtOWU3MDg0ZjMxMTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sue works in a library.

 --- Description: Days of the Bagnold Summer: Directed by Simon Bird. With Monica Dolan, Earl Cave, Elliot Speller-Gillott, Tamsin Greig.

He does not have a great relationship with his mum Sue, who, despite having a sunny disposition and cheery manner is also painfully unsure of herself. Daniel is hoping to spend the summer with his father who is now living in Florida but when that plan is scuppered it's clear that he's going to have to spend it with his mother.\n\nTo say this film is understated is....well, an understatement. Some reviews have seen the film as pointless and innocuous and to be fair this directorial debut by actor Simon Bird isn't going to change your life but I found a lot to like. There are plenty of laugh out loud moments a few moving ones (but not overtly sentimental) the direction and photography and the songs of Belle and Sebastian perfectly capture the bright but often deadly dull days of a suburban British summer. The supporting cast is full of great British comic actors who are great although the central performances of Earl Cave and especially Monica Dolan as son and mother are quite wonderful.\n\nYour socks won't be blown off but give yourself 85 minutes to immerse yourself into this world and you will find it, I think, a rather disarmingly charming experience.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1800,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2020-06-08","keywords":"teenager","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2582232601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjJhMmQ4ZGQtMTc3YS00ZTlkLTk5YzQtOWU3MDg0ZjMxMTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjJhMmQ4ZGQtMTc3YS00ZTlkLTk5YzQtOWU3MDg0ZjMxMTczXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Sue works in a library.

It reminded me Trainspotting a bit - quite dark and realistic, but extremely funny from time to time.

A detailed synopsis will actually diminish the experience in my opinion. The film is a black and white production set in 1960s Oklahoma. The story is centrally about an unlikely relationship between two young women. That's as much as you need to know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the depth of field was above average even for a studio production. As an independent film, the photography earns extra points. The production was shot on location so we can't talk about set design. However, the costumes and staging were pretty spectacular too.\n\nI was a little disappointed to learn the film was dual-chromatic. Meaning the producers and director essentially shot both in color and non-color before deciding which cut to release. The film wasn't exclusively crafted as a black and white film. On the upside though, the director obviously took care enough to ensure everything contrasted well in black and white from the beginning. The contrast is very well done and obviously extensively planned.\n\nThe best part of the film is probably the performances though. Kara Hayward steals the show in my opinion. However, there is such a long list of supporting roles it's hard to say which one is best. Liana Liberato deserves a mention as an essential co-star but the list really doesn't end there. If I had to level any criticism, I'd say the male performances didn't really keep up.\n\nThe difference probably relates more to writing than how the actors were portrayed but the difference is noticeable. All the male characters, with maybe one exception, are decidedly two dimensional. The female characters, whether by acting or writing, display a lot more depth and interest for the viewer. The distinction was obviously intentional. However, there is a problem.\n\nWithout giving anything away, the sheer volume of depth almost overwhelms the film at some points. I feel as though there were too many interesting plot lines to explore. The film might have accomplished more with less. Instead, I encountered some odd cropped scenes where you're left wondering where some of the ideas came or went.\n\nNot exactly continuity glitches. More like questions left hanging. I won't tell you the details. Suffices to say though, the climax of the film ends up feeling a bit rushed and most of the sub-plots leave the film feeling inconclusive. One loose end was certainly intentional. However, I'm talking about the film as a whole.\n\nGo watch and enjoy. The film is a lot more successful than not.

"The Danish Girl" is also in its way a film about torture, but more akin to the mental torture seen in films like "Buried" or "Flightpath". What must it be like to be trapped with a sexual orientation that you feel is not your own? To possess physical body parts you don't believe you should have? And all in a time (the 1920's) when an exposed ankle was considered slightly daring.\n\nBased on a true story, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne ("The Theory of Everything") and Alicia Vikander ("Ex Machina") play a bohemian married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. Einar is a renowned landscape artist with his wife a struggling portrait artist living in his shadow. After taking part in a cross-dressing modelling session, strong feelings are awakened in Einar. As a bit of a 'game' Gerda encourages him to explore the character of his alter-ego "Lili" further: a big mistake, as Einar is swept into a spiral of confusion and self-doubt.\n\nEddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar-nomination for his brave performance as Einar/Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect and delivering a truly heart-rending performance. With all this said however, I never quite believed I was watching the character of Lili but more Redmayne acting the character. Perhaps this is unfair, as Einar/Lili is such a bizarrely multi-dimensional person no one could perhaps have played him/her to my satisfaction. But I suspect (particularly as Redmayne won last year) this won't bring Redmayne the Oscar double. \n\nFar more impressive for me was the delicious and delightful Alicia Vikander, once more turning in a fantastic performance as the increasingly desperate (both psychologically and sexually) Gerda. With Rooney Mara, Vikander must be one of the brightest actress talents in today's cinema. \n\nAlso turning in a strong performance, in what is a very limited cast list, is Matthias Schoenaerts ("Far from the Madding Crowd") as a Parisian art dealer with a link to Einar's past. The omni-present (sorry, that should read "hard-working") Ben Whishaw turns up again as a party guest with an unhealthy interest in Lili and Sebastian Koch (most recently seen in series 5 of "Homeland") plays Dr Warnekros who is a pioneer in the new and risky business of sexual reassignment surgery.\n\nAnother star of the film is the luscious Danish capital, filmed in vibrant colours, as if from the artists' palettes, by Danny Cohen, a Hooper favourite. Also a big surprise to me was the gloriously photographed Danish countryside, seen at the end of the film, with mountains and seascapes I never knew existed.\n\nAnother Hooper alumni, Alexandre Desplat, supplies the soupy but very fitting score.\n\nWhile the film features a compelling story and much impressive acting, I never personally felt as connected to the story as I was to "The King's Speech". This isn't helped by a rather stagy script by Lucinda Coxon that feels lightweight at times. Perhaps its because we are in Oscar- season but, to me, it all felt a tad pretentious and (no pun intended) could have done with a few snips in places to reduce the running time by 15 minutes or so. That being said, and as an alternative view, I should point out that my wife was in tears for a good proportion of the film and disagrees vehemently with my views. I say "my wife", but since watching the film she's started wearing braces and smoking cigars – so I'm rather confused as to WHAT exactly is going on. :-)\n\n(For the graphical version of this review, see bob-the-movie-man.com.

I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. \n\nWhat it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.\n\nNow is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. \n\nNow to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.\n\nWhy was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.\n\nYou should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts.

I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. \n\nWhat it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.\n\nNow is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. \n\nNow to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.\n\nWhy was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.\n\nYou should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":549951,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-02-27","keywords":"oil,misanthrope,loss of hearing,1910s,prospector","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"There Will Be Blood","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1341980953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRhOWY5N2EtYzk0NS00ZTFlLTk4MTktMzdhYWM5OGFmMDM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRhOWY5N2EtYzk0NS00ZTFlLTk4MTktMzdhYWM5OGFmMDM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Miramax","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000358/","name":"Daniel Day-Lewis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001354/","name":"Ciarán Hinds"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000759/","name":"Paul Thomas Anderson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027686/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000759/","name":"Paul Thomas Anderson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0801737/","name":"Upton Sinclair"],"duration":"PT2H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Could you be a bit more specific? Assuming that you're not talking about making a trip to Nepal, there are still many ways to interpret your request besides seeing the 2015 docudrama. The world's tallest mountain is the center of the story in a 1998 documentary, a 2007 TV mini-series, a 2014-2015 TV series and another film project still in development. All of these treatments are simply titled, "Everest". More to the point, 2015's "Everest" (PG-13, 2:01) re-tells the specific story from the '98 doc and a 1997 TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest"), but tells it more vividly than ever before.\n\nThe '97, '98 and 2015 films all take us along for doomed expeditions up the tallest peak in the Himalayas in May 1996, as told in at least five books by survivors, most famously in journalist Jon Krakauer's 1997 best-seller "Into Thin Air", which is the primary basis for the screenplay of 2015's "Everest". As the film tells us early on, by the late 1980s, climbing Everest had transitioned from the domain of adventurers like George Mallory and Edmund Hillary with minimal equipment to a tourist destination for thrill-seekers with little climbing experience, but enough money to buy state-of-the-art equipment, stay in established base camps, and hire local Sherpas as guides and, in some cases, to carry the climber's gear and cook meals. But as the films about the 1996 climbs (and subsequent major avalanches) have shown, no amount of money, gear, help or even experience can insulate anyone from the dangers inherent in this climb. "The last word," as one character in the 2015 film says, "always belongs to the mountain." "Everest" follows two of the expeditions which suffered tragic losses on the mountain on May 10-11, 1996. Rival expedition leaders Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), of the company Adventure Consultants, and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), of Mountain Madness, decide to work together due to the large number of people trying to reach the peak on May 10th. The main focus of the story is Hall's team, which includes people with a wide range of personal backgrounds. Hall is an experienced New Zealand mountaineer who has already climbed to the top of Everest four times, including once with his wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), who has stayed in New Zealand this time due to her pregnancy. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is a mailman who attempted Everest once before and wants to reach the summit as a way of inspiring schoolchildren back home in Washington state. Yasuko Namba is a 47-year-old Japanese woman who has already climbed the other six of the famed Seven Summits and wants to become the oldest woman to reach the top of Everest. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is an adventurous Texan who is also pursuing the goal of the Seven Summits, but has lied to his wife, Peach (Robin Wright), about his current trip to Everest. Jon Krakauer is a writer for "Outside" magazine, but has never been on a climb above 8000m. Several of the people portrayed in this film died on Everest and others barely escaped with their lives.\n\n"Everest" is much more than a high-altitude adventure movie or disaster flick. Besides learning about the personal backgrounds of the characters, we follow them on their entire adventure, from beginning to end, learning a good bit about mountain climbing along the way. One of the first things we learn is that, to these people, summit is a verb. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. "Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying," he says. This group understands all that, but they've put their trust in the honest, personable and level-headed Hall. And they've paid him a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest – and safely back down. At base camp, Hall and his friend and colleague, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and their fellow Adventure Consultants employees, teach, coach and take care of their customers, including Hall taking them on some practice climbs. In spite of the danger and discomfort that everyone experiences even going only partially up the mountain, they're all looking forward to the real thing. They know they'll be cold, exhausted and scared, while having trouble breathing and facing the unpredictability of the mountain, but they didn't come this far to quit. Their experiences turn out much worse than anything any of them could have imagined.\n\n"Everest" is a fascinating and gripping adventure. Like other movies about mountain climbing, this one fails to give a satisfactory reason for why these people risk their lives for little more than a great view and bragging rights, but it's clear that there are a variety of justifications within the group.

Could you be a bit more specific? Assuming that you're not talking about making a trip to Nepal, there are still many ways to interpret your request besides seeing the 2015 docudrama. The world's tallest mountain is the center of the story in a 1998 documentary, a 2007 TV mini-series, a 2014-2015 TV series and another film project still in development. All of these treatments are simply titled, "Everest". More to the point, 2015's "Everest" (PG-13, 2:01) re-tells the specific story from the '98 doc and a 1997 TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest"), but tells it more vividly than ever before.\n\nThe '97, '98 and 2015 films all take us along for doomed expeditions up the tallest peak in the Himalayas in May 1996, as told in at least five books by survivors, most famously in journalist Jon Krakauer's 1997 best-seller "Into Thin Air", which is the primary basis for the screenplay of 2015's "Everest". As the film tells us early on, by the late 1980s, climbing Everest had transitioned from the domain of adventurers like George Mallory and Edmund Hillary with minimal equipment to a tourist destination for thrill-seekers with little climbing experience, but enough money to buy state-of-the-art equipment, stay in established base camps, and hire local Sherpas as guides and, in some cases, to carry the climber's gear and cook meals. But as the films about the 1996 climbs (and subsequent major avalanches) have shown, no amount of money, gear, help or even experience can insulate anyone from the dangers inherent in this climb. "The last word," as one character in the 2015 film says, "always belongs to the mountain." "Everest" follows two of the expeditions which suffered tragic losses on the mountain on May 10-11, 1996. Rival expedition leaders Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), of the company Adventure Consultants, and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), of Mountain Madness, decide to work together due to the large number of people trying to reach the peak on May 10th. The main focus of the story is Hall's team, which includes people with a wide range of personal backgrounds. Hall is an experienced New Zealand mountaineer who has already climbed to the top of Everest four times, including once with his wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), who has stayed in New Zealand this time due to her pregnancy. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is a mailman who attempted Everest once before and wants to reach the summit as a way of inspiring schoolchildren back home in Washington state. Yasuko Namba is a 47-year-old Japanese woman who has already climbed the other six of the famed Seven Summits and wants to become the oldest woman to reach the top of Everest. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is an adventurous Texan who is also pursuing the goal of the Seven Summits, but has lied to his wife, Peach (Robin Wright), about his current trip to Everest. Jon Krakauer is a writer for "Outside" magazine, but has never been on a climb above 8000m. Several of the people portrayed in this film died on Everest and others barely escaped with their lives.\n\n"Everest" is much more than a high-altitude adventure movie or disaster flick. Besides learning about the personal backgrounds of the characters, we follow them on their entire adventure, from beginning to end, learning a good bit about mountain climbing along the way. One of the first things we learn is that, to these people, summit is a verb. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. "Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying," he says. This group understands all that, but they've put their trust in the honest, personable and level-headed Hall. And they've paid him a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest – and safely back down. At base camp, Hall and his friend and colleague, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and their fellow Adventure Consultants employees, teach, coach and take care of their customers, including Hall taking them on some practice climbs. In spite of the danger and discomfort that everyone experiences even going only partially up the mountain, they're all looking forward to the real thing. They know they'll be cold, exhausted and scared, while having trouble breathing and facing the unpredictability of the mountain, but they didn't come this far to quit. Their experiences turn out much worse than anything any of them could have imagined.\n\n"Everest" is a fascinating and gripping adventure. Like other movies about mountain climbing, this one fails to give a satisfactory reason for why these people risk their lives for little more than a great view and bragging rights, but it's clear that there are a variety of justifications within the group. The script depicts this climb as an extremely risky venture, but allows us to marvel at the courage, determination and, in some cases, self-sacrifice of these people. The character development (thanks to a great script and a terrific cast) is outstanding and the cinematography is as impressive as you'd expect (especially in IMAX 3-D). The suffering of the climbers (even when things are going according to plan), the thrilling moments (when circumstances throw the plan into chaos), the heartbreak and the small victories along the way all make us feel like we're right there on that mountain. The hardships and the tragedies of this expedition are sometimes shot and edited oddly, but are never exploitive. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur brings us an engaging, eye-opening and beautiful film that most are likely to appreciate.

"The Danish Girl" is also in its way a film about torture, but more akin to the mental torture seen in films like "Buried" or "Flightpath". What must it be like to be trapped with a sexual orientation that you feel is not your own? To possess physical body parts you don't believe you should have? And all in a time (the 1920's) when an exposed ankle was considered slightly daring.\n\nBased on a true story, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne ("The Theory of Everything") and Alicia Vikander ("Ex Machina") play a bohemian married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. Einar is a renowned landscape artist with his wife a struggling portrait artist living in his shadow. After taking part in a cross-dressing modelling session, strong feelings are awakened in Einar. As a bit of a 'game' Gerda encourages him to explore the character of his alter-ego "Lili" further: a big mistake, as Einar is swept into a spiral of confusion and self-doubt.\n\nEddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar-nomination for his brave performance as Einar/Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect and delivering a truly heart-rending performance. With all this said however, I never quite believed I was watching the character of Lili but more Redmayne acting the character. Perhaps this is unfair, as Einar/Lili is such a bizarrely multi-dimensional person no one could perhaps have played him/her to my satisfaction. But I suspect (particularly as Redmayne won last year) this won't bring Redmayne the Oscar double. \n\nFar more impressive for me was the delicious and delightful Alicia Vikander, once more turning in a fantastic performance as the increasingly desperate (both psychologically and sexually) Gerda. With Rooney Mara, Vikander must be one of the brightest actress talents in today's cinema. \n\nAlso turning in a strong performance, in what is a very limited cast list, is Matthias Schoenaerts ("Far from the Madding Crowd") as a Parisian art dealer with a link to Einar's past. The omni-present (sorry, that should read "hard-working") Ben Whishaw turns up again as a party guest with an unhealthy interest in Lili and Sebastian Koch (most recently seen in series 5 of "Homeland") plays Dr Warnekros who is a pioneer in the new and risky business of sexual reassignment surgery.\n\nAnother star of the film is the luscious Danish capital, filmed in vibrant colours, as if from the artists' palettes, by Danny Cohen, a Hooper favourite. Also a big surprise to me was the gloriously photographed Danish countryside, seen at the end of the film, with mountains and seascapes I never knew existed.\n\nAnother Hooper alumni, Alexandre Desplat, supplies the soupy but very fitting score.\n\nWhile the film features a compelling story and much impressive acting, I never personally felt as connected to the story as I was to "The King's Speech". This isn't helped by a rather stagy script by Lucinda Coxon that feels lightweight at times. Perhaps its because we are in Oscar- season but, to me, it all felt a tad pretentious and (no pun intended) could have done with a few snips in places to reduce the running time by 15 minutes or so. That being said, and as an alternative view, I should point out that my wife was in tears for a good proportion of the film and disagrees vehemently with my views. I say "my wife", but since watching the film she's started wearing braces and smoking cigars – so I'm rather confused as to WHAT exactly is going on. :-)\n\n(For the graphical version of this review, see bob-the-movie-man.com.

Could you be a bit more specific? Assuming that you're not talking about making a trip to Nepal, there are still many ways to interpret your request besides seeing the 2015 docudrama. The world's tallest mountain is the center of the story in a 1998 documentary, a 2007 TV mini-series, a 2014-2015 TV series and another film project still in development. All of these treatments are simply titled, "Everest". More to the point, 2015's "Everest" (PG-13, 2:01) re-tells the specific story from the '98 doc and a 1997 TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest"), but tells it more vividly than ever before.\n\nThe '97, '98 and 2015 films all take us along for doomed expeditions up the tallest peak in the Himalayas in May 1996, as told in at least five books by survivors, most famously in journalist Jon Krakauer's 1997 best-seller "Into Thin Air", which is the primary basis for the screenplay of 2015's "Everest". As the film tells us early on, by the late 1980s, climbing Everest had transitioned from the domain of adventurers like George Mallory and Edmund Hillary with minimal equipment to a tourist destination for thrill-seekers with little climbing experience, but enough money to buy state-of-the-art equipment, stay in established base camps, and hire local Sherpas as guides and, in some cases, to carry the climber's gear and cook meals. But as the films about the 1996 climbs (and subsequent major avalanches) have shown, no amount of money, gear, help or even experience can insulate anyone from the dangers inherent in this climb. "The last word," as one character in the 2015 film says, "always belongs to the mountain." "Everest" follows two of the expeditions which suffered tragic losses on the mountain on May 10-11, 1996. Rival expedition leaders Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), of the company Adventure Consultants, and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), of Mountain Madness, decide to work together due to the large number of people trying to reach the peak on May 10th. The main focus of the story is Hall's team, which includes people with a wide range of personal backgrounds. Hall is an experienced New Zealand mountaineer who has already climbed to the top of Everest four times, including once with his wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), who has stayed in New Zealand this time due to her pregnancy. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is a mailman who attempted Everest once before and wants to reach the summit as a way of inspiring schoolchildren back home in Washington state. Yasuko Namba is a 47-year-old Japanese woman who has already climbed the other six of the famed Seven Summits and wants to become the oldest woman to reach the top of Everest. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is an adventurous Texan who is also pursuing the goal of the Seven Summits, but has lied to his wife, Peach (Robin Wright), about his current trip to Everest. Jon Krakauer is a writer for "Outside" magazine, but has never been on a climb above 8000m. Several of the people portrayed in this film died on Everest and others barely escaped with their lives.\n\n"Everest" is much more than a high-altitude adventure movie or disaster flick. Besides learning about the personal backgrounds of the characters, we follow them on their entire adventure, from beginning to end, learning a good bit about mountain climbing along the way. One of the first things we learn is that, to these people, summit is a verb. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. "Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying," he says. This group understands all that, but they've put their trust in the honest, personable and level-headed Hall. And they've paid him a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest – and safely back down. At base camp, Hall and his friend and colleague, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and their fellow Adventure Consultants employees, teach, coach and take care of their customers, including Hall taking them on some practice climbs. In spite of the danger and discomfort that everyone experiences even going only partially up the mountain, they're all looking forward to the real thing. They know they'll be cold, exhausted and scared, while having trouble breathing and facing the unpredictability of the mountain, but they didn't come this far to quit. Their experiences turn out much worse than anything any of them could have imagined.\n\n"Everest" is a fascinating and gripping adventure. Like other movies about mountain climbing, this one fails to give a satisfactory reason for why these people risk their lives for little more than a great view and bragging rights, but it's clear that there are a variety of justifications within the group. The script depicts this climb as an extremely risky venture, but allows us to marvel at the courage, determination and, in some cases, self-sacrifice of these people. The character development (thanks to a great script and a terrific cast) is outstanding and the cinematography is as impressive as you'd expect (especially in IMAX 3-D). The suffering of the climbers (even when things are going according to plan), the thrilling moments (when circumstances throw the plan into chaos), the heartbreak and the small victories along the way all make us feel like we're right there on that mountain. The hardships and the tragedies of this expedition are sometimes shot and edited oddly, but are never exploitive. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur brings us an engaging, eye-opening and beautiful film that most are likely to appreciate.

Could you be a bit more specific? Assuming that you're not talking about making a trip to Nepal, there are still many ways to interpret your request besides seeing the 2015 docudrama. The world's tallest mountain is the center of the story in a 1998 documentary, a 2007 TV mini-series, a 2014-2015 TV series and another film project still in development. All of these treatments are simply titled, "Everest". More to the point, 2015's "Everest" (PG-13, 2:01) re-tells the specific story from the '98 doc and a 1997 TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest"), but tells it more vividly than ever before.\n\nThe '97, '98 and 2015 films all take us along for doomed expeditions up the tallest peak in the Himalayas in May 1996, as told in at least five books by survivors, most famously in journalist Jon Krakauer's 1997 best-seller "Into Thin Air", which is the primary basis for the screenplay of 2015's "Everest". As the film tells us early on, by the late 1980s, climbing Everest had transitioned from the domain of adventurers like George Mallory and Edmund Hillary with minimal equipment to a tourist destination for thrill-seekers with little climbing experience, but enough money to buy state-of-the-art equipment, stay in established base camps, and hire local Sherpas as guides and, in some cases, to carry the climber's gear and cook meals. But as the films about the 1996 climbs (and subsequent major avalanches) have shown, no amount of money, gear, help or even experience can insulate anyone from the dangers inherent in this climb. "The last word," as one character in the 2015 film says, "always belongs to the mountain." "Everest" follows two of the expeditions which suffered tragic losses on the mountain on May 10-11, 1996. Rival expedition leaders Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), of the company Adventure Consultants, and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), of Mountain Madness, decide to work together due to the large number of people trying to reach the peak on May 10th. The main focus of the story is Hall's team, which includes people with a wide range of personal backgrounds. Hall is an experienced New Zealand mountaineer who has already climbed to the top of Everest four times, including once with his wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), who has stayed in New Zealand this time due to her pregnancy. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is a mailman who attempted Everest once before and wants to reach the summit as a way of inspiring schoolchildren back home in Washington state. Yasuko Namba is a 47-year-old Japanese woman who has already climbed the other six of the famed Seven Summits and wants to become the oldest woman to reach the top of Everest. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is an adventurous Texan who is also pursuing the goal of the Seven Summits, but has lied to his wife, Peach (Robin Wright), about his current trip to Everest. Jon Krakauer is a writer for "Outside" magazine, but has never been on a climb above 8000m. Several of the people portrayed in this film died on Everest and others barely escaped with their lives.\n\n"Everest" is much more than a high-altitude adventure movie or disaster flick. Besides learning about the personal backgrounds of the characters, we follow them on their entire adventure, from beginning to end, learning a good bit about mountain climbing along the way. One of the first things we learn is that, to these people, summit is a verb. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. "Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying," he says. This group understands all that, but they've put their trust in the honest, personable and level-headed Hall. And they've paid him a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest – and safely back down. At base camp, Hall and his friend and colleague, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and their fellow Adventure Consultants employees, teach, coach and take care of their customers, including Hall taking them on some practice climbs. In spite of the danger and discomfort that everyone experiences even going only partially up the mountain, they're all looking forward to the real thing. They know they'll be cold, exhausted and scared, while having trouble breathing and facing the unpredictability of the mountain, but they didn't come this far to quit. Their experiences turn out much worse than anything any of them could have imagined.\n\n"Everest" is a fascinating and gripping adventure. Like other movies about mountain climbing, this one fails to give a satisfactory reason for why these people risk their lives for little more than a great view and bragging rights, but it's clear that there are a variety of justifications within the group. The script depicts this climb as an extremely risky venture, but allows us to marvel at the courage, determination and, in some cases, self-sacrifice of these people. The character development (thanks to a great script and a terrific cast) is outstanding and the cinematography is as impressive as you'd expect (especially in IMAX 3-D). The suffering of the climbers (even when things are going according to plan), the thrilling moments (when circumstances throw the plan into chaos), the heartbreak and the small victories along the way all make us feel like we're right there on that mountain. The hardships and the tragedies of this expedition are sometimes shot and edited oddly, but are never exploitive. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur brings us an engaging, eye-opening and beautiful film that most are likely to appreciate.

If you're a Star Wars geek this movie totally is for you. Basically it's a movie about Star Wars geeks made by Star Wars geeks for a target audience of Star Wars geeks. If you are not into all things Star Wars this movie may well miss the mark with you. And even the most rabid of Star Wars fans would have to concede that the movie is certainly not anything spectacular. It's fairly charming and reasonably amusing but never really riotously funny. But it works. More or less.\n\nThe movie is set in the autumn of 1998, a time before Jar Jar Binks had been foisted upon the world. Four friends, major Star Wars geeks all, decide to drive across the country, break into Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of The Phantom Menace. The major motivation for this journey is that one of the friends has cancer and will not live to see the movie released. But once that is established the cancer storyline is basically put on the back burner and this turns into a mostly predictable wacky road-trip comedy. Some of the wackiness works, some of it falls flat. There are a bunch of celebrity cameos thrown in, some of which are inspired and some of which are rather random and pointless. So it's a movie which has its ups and downs. But it's enjoyable more often than not and the movie breezes by in a nice, tight, well-paced 90 minutes.\n\nNone of the actors playing our gang of four really stand out in any memorable way. Dan Fogler's character is a little more outrageous than the others but that's about it. But the group works together well and they are ably supported by the varied cast of characters who pop up throughout. Seth Rogen's portrayal of a pimp is one of the standouts. Of course this ode to Star Wars fans wouldn't be complete without taking some shots at Trekkies. So there's room for another funny turn by an actor portraying Admiral Seasholtz, an uber-Trekkie. Who is the unrecognizable actor memorably bringing this character to life? You may have to wait until the closing credits roll to figure it out. And in this Star Wars geek universe there's room for one girl and Kristen Bell is both charming and funny in the role as her character gets swept along for the ride. Could the movie be a little more consistently funny? Most definitely. But the movie about Star Wars geeks will probably leave you with a smile on your face.

Rob asks at the very beginning of the film and it is here that Rob decides to investigate just how he is at fault to the 5 all time greatest break ups in his love life a la The Top 5s he and his co-horts in crime habitually categorize all things pertinent to music.  What follows is a laugh-filled introspection of the heart on its sleeve and its tongue sharply in cheek as to Rob's quest of finding all his faults and foibles in hope of wooing back his recent romantic dismissal that includes 5 prototypes of all heterosexual men: The First Kiss/Crush; The Adolescent Urgency/Loss of Virginity, The Woman Out of His League; The Rebound Best Friend/Possible Soul Mate and finally, The One True Love He Isn't Even Aware Of.\n\nThe approach may seem old hat and gimmicky (Cusack breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly into the camera) yet it isn't intrusive but enlightening into what the hero is really thinking and more importantly why.  Surrounded by a truly winning cast, Cusack shines once again as a likable average guy who is trying to remain a guy although the inner voice of Be A Man is palpable and reverberating inside.  His nonchalant, casual way of speaking and his slow burns are priceless (he finally takes out his frustrations on Laura's new beau, the unctious sensitive pony-tailed Ian played by Cusack's best bud and former co-star of `The Sure Thing' and the cult classic `Tapeheads', Robbins, in the film's funniest fantasy sequence of Rob, Barry and Dick pummeling Ian to death). Cusack's constant streak of the smart alecky good guy continues from the quintessential portrait of Lloyd Dobler, kickboxing student of the affairs of the heart in the classic `Say Anything.' and the previous purveyor of romantic comedy, Walter `Gib' Gibson in the update of `It Happened One Night', `The Sure Thing' to his hit-man Martin Blank pondering his high school reunion with dread in the black comedy  `Grosse Pointe Blank' (reunited here with his screenwriters/partners in crime D.V. De Vincentis, Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg).\n\nThe women portraying Rob's Girlfriends of Christmas Past , so to speak, are exemplery especially Taylor (another Cusack repertoire player, who played his best gal pal/voice of reason in `Anything.') as Sarah the rebound fling and Zeta-Jones as Charlie (showing some nice moments of sublime sardonicism), the sexy babe completely out of his element). Bonet has a few nice moments as local singer Marie De Salle who provides some unsubtle ways of bringing Rob to his senses.  Sister Joan provides some comic bile as well as mutual friend to Laura and Rob. But frankly it's a guy's flick and thanks to the boisterous Black (late of HBO's comedy series `Tenacious D' and a score of films as diverse as `Mars Attacks!' and last year's co-starring with Cusack in  `Cradle Will Rock') and geeky, quiet Louiso adding some color especially in their scenes together debating their varied choices of musical tastes.\n\nDirected by Stephen Frears, a fellow Englishman who appears to know the American arcana striking a responsive chord (he put Cusack through the paces in the neo-noir classic `The Grifters' a decade ago) allows his characters time to pace themselves from one setup to the next and skillfully keeps the smart patter gleaned from the book alive on screen.\n\nEasily one of the year's funniest films and finally  a film I whole heartedly recommend in what seemed to be dearth of mediocrity thus far in the new millennium.  To paraphrase the emergence of Bruce Springsteen (who has a funny cameo) into rock's pantheon I will allude this to comedy: I have seen the future and it is John Cusack.

Rob asks at the very beginning of the film and it is here that Rob decides to investigate just how he is at fault to the 5 all time greatest break ups in his love life a la The Top 5s he and his co-horts in crime habitually categorize all things pertinent to music.  What follows is a laugh-filled introspection of the heart on its sleeve and its tongue sharply in cheek as to Rob's quest of finding all his faults and foibles in hope of wooing back his recent romantic dismissal that includes 5 prototypes of all heterosexual men: The First Kiss/Crush; The Adolescent Urgency/Loss of Virginity, The Woman Out of His League; The Rebound Best Friend/Possible Soul Mate and finally, The One True Love He Isn't Even Aware Of.\n\nThe approach may seem old hat and gimmicky (Cusack breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly into the camera) yet it isn't intrusive but enlightening into what the hero is really thinking and more importantly why.  Surrounded by a truly winning cast, Cusack shines once again as a likable average guy who is trying to remain a guy although the inner voice of Be A Man is palpable and reverberating inside.  His nonchalant, casual way of speaking and his slow burns are priceless (he finally takes out his frustrations on Laura's new beau, the unctious sensitive pony-tailed Ian played by Cusack's best bud and former co-star of `The Sure Thing' and the cult classic `Tapeheads', Robbins, in the film's funniest fantasy sequence of Rob, Barry and Dick pummeling Ian to death). Cusack's constant streak of the smart alecky good guy continues from the quintessential portrait of Lloyd Dobler, kickboxing student of the affairs of the heart in the classic `Say Anything.' and the previous purveyor of romantic comedy, Walter `Gib' Gibson in the update of `It Happened One Night', `The Sure Thing' to his hit-man Martin Blank pondering his high school reunion with dread in the black comedy  `Grosse Pointe Blank' (reunited here with his screenwriters/partners in crime D.V. De Vincentis, Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg).\n\nThe women portraying Rob's Girlfriends of Christmas Past , so to speak, are exemplery especially Taylor (another Cusack repertoire player, who played his best gal pal/voice of reason in `Anything.') as Sarah the rebound fling and Zeta-Jones as Charlie (showing some nice moments of sublime sardonicism), the sexy babe completely out of his element). Bonet has a few nice moments as local singer Marie De Salle who provides some unsubtle ways of bringing Rob to his senses.  Sister Joan provides some comic bile as well as mutual friend to Laura and Rob. But frankly it's a guy's flick and thanks to the boisterous Black (late of HBO's comedy series `Tenacious D' and a score of films as diverse as `Mars Attacks!' and last year's co-starring with Cusack in  `Cradle Will Rock') and geeky, quiet Louiso adding some color especially in their scenes together debating their varied choices of musical tastes.\n\nDirected by Stephen Frears, a fellow Englishman who appears to know the American arcana striking a responsive chord (he put Cusack through the paces in the neo-noir classic `The Grifters' a decade ago) allows his characters time to pace themselves from one setup to the next and skillfully keeps the smart patter gleaned from the book alive on screen.\n\nEasily one of the year's funniest films and finally  a film I whole heartedly recommend in what seemed to be dearth of mediocrity thus far in the new millennium.

Rob asks at the very beginning of the film and it is here that Rob decides to investigate just how he is at fault to the 5 all time greatest break ups in his love life a la The Top 5s he and his co-horts in crime habitually categorize all things pertinent to music.  What follows is a laugh-filled introspection of the heart on its sleeve and its tongue sharply in cheek as to Rob's quest of finding all his faults and foibles in hope of wooing back his recent romantic dismissal that includes 5 prototypes of all heterosexual men: The First Kiss/Crush; The Adolescent Urgency/Loss of Virginity, The Woman Out of His League; The Rebound Best Friend/Possible Soul Mate and finally, The One True Love He Isn't Even Aware Of.\n\nThe approach may seem old hat and gimmicky (Cusack breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly into the camera) yet it isn't intrusive but enlightening into what the hero is really thinking and more importantly why.  Surrounded by a truly winning cast, Cusack shines once again as a likable average guy who is trying to remain a guy although the inner voice of Be A Man is palpable and reverberating inside.  His nonchalant, casual way of speaking and his slow burns are priceless (he finally takes out his frustrations on Laura's new beau, the unctious sensitive pony-tailed Ian played by Cusack's best bud and former co-star of `The Sure Thing' and the cult classic `Tapeheads', Robbins, in the film's funniest fantasy sequence of Rob, Barry and Dick pummeling Ian to death). Cusack's constant streak of the smart alecky good guy continues from the quintessential portrait of Lloyd Dobler, kickboxing student of the affairs of the heart in the classic `Say Anything.' and the previous purveyor of romantic comedy, Walter `Gib' Gibson in the update of `It Happened One Night', `The Sure Thing' to his hit-man Martin Blank pondering his high school reunion with dread in the black comedy  `Grosse Pointe Blank' (reunited here with his screenwriters/partners in crime D.V. De Vincentis, Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg).\n\nThe women portraying Rob's Girlfriends of Christmas Past , so to speak, are exemplery especially Taylor (another Cusack repertoire player, who played his best gal pal/voice of reason in `Anything.') as Sarah the rebound fling and Zeta-Jones as Charlie (showing some nice moments of sublime sardonicism), the sexy babe completely out of his element). Bonet has a few nice moments as local singer Marie De Salle who provides some unsubtle ways of bringing Rob to his senses.  Sister Joan provides some comic bile as well as mutual friend to Laura and Rob. But frankly it's a guy's flick and thanks to the boisterous Black (late of HBO's comedy series `Tenacious D' and a score of films as diverse as `Mars Attacks!' and last year's co-starring with Cusack in  `Cradle Will Rock') and geeky, quiet Louiso adding some color especially in their scenes together debating their varied choices of musical tastes.\n\nDirected by Stephen Frears, a fellow Englishman who appears to know the American arcana striking a responsive chord (he put Cusack through the paces in the neo-noir classic `The Grifters' a decade ago) allows his characters time to pace themselves from one setup to the next and skillfully keeps the smart patter gleaned from the book alive on screen.\n\nEasily one of the year's funniest films and finally  a film I whole heartedly recommend in what seemed to be dearth of mediocrity thus far in the new millennium.  To paraphrase the emergence of Bruce Springsteen (who has a funny cameo) into rock's pantheon I will allude this to comedy: I have seen the future and it is John Cusack.

And seeing that he is not only the star but also the director and producer of this, makes it even worst.\n\nSurprisingly enough this is a movie worth seeing. I'm with the professionals critics (Entertainment Weekly, Chicago Sun-Times) who gave it 3.5/4 stars or A- . I wasn't too hasty to hate it, and believe me, by the end of it, the chances are that you might actually like it.\n\nThe star of this is an anti-hero. A man who lacks the conventional heroic attributes. This movie isn't about idealism, or courage or morality. Basically it's a movie about bitterness.\n\nThe main protagonist has his own reasons to be bitter and a cynic. In a way the whole movie is his little revenge. But in his little voyage to that dark destination, he does find the good in his heart, plus an unlikely friend.\n\nAlthough it starts like a comedy (and with some crude humor), the movie builds in emotions especially towards the end.\n\nOverall: Check-it out."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-03-28","keywords":"spelling bee,forty something,high school dropout,spelling,two word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3718425369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyOTc3MjgxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQzNzEwMTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyOTc3MjgxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQzNzEwMTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"40-year-old Guy Trilby finds a loophole in the rules of the National Quill Spelling Bee and decides to cause trouble by hijacking the competition.

And seeing that he is not only the star but also the director and producer of this, makes it even worst.\n\nSurprisingly enough this is a movie worth seeing. I'm with the professionals critics (Entertainment Weekly, Chicago Sun-Times) who gave it 3.5/4 stars or A- . I wasn't too hasty to hate it, and believe me, by the end of it, the chances are that you might actually like it.\n\nThe star of this is an anti-hero. A man who lacks the conventional heroic attributes. This movie isn't about idealism, or courage or morality. Basically it's a movie about bitterness.\n\nThe main protagonist has his own reasons to be bitter and a cynic. In a way the whole movie is his little revenge. But in his little voyage to that dark destination, he does find the good in his heart, plus an unlikely friend.\n\nAlthough it starts like a comedy (and with some crude humor), the movie builds in emotions especially towards the end.\n\nOverall: Check-it out.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":48703,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-03-28","keywords":"spelling bee,forty something,high school dropout,spelling,two word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3718425369","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyOTc3MjgxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQzNzEwMTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyOTc3MjgxOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQzNzEwMTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"40-year-old Guy Trilby finds a loophole in the rules of the National Quill Spelling Bee and decides to cause trouble by hijacking the competition.

If anyone gets an opportunity to see it, grab it right away!!!\n\nThe story itself is unbelievably shocking. I cried feeling the pain, the guilt, hope, kindness of people... I laughed a lot - the hero of the story has an amusing personality and snappy sense of humor. So many emotions in one place.\n\nAs Lithuanian born in independent Lithuania, I am surprised I have never heard of this story. My farther mentioned that he heard "something" about it during soviet times, I believe because the soviets didn't want people to be inspired by S. Kudirka.\n\nCritic J. B. Spins writes: "It was called the U. S. Coast Guard's "Day of Shame," but it brought out the best in America." What a wonderful thing is to give a hand to a human that is reaching for one. This one person made an outstanding revelation on what life is like under the iron curtain.\n\nThe way the story is built, the details - it is just marvelous work!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"genre":["Documentary","History"],"datePublished":"2020-06-22","keywords":"iron curtain,1970,defector,usa,soviet union","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004847/","name":"Walter Cronkite","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0633271/","name":"Richard Nixon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3443191/","name":"Simas Kudirka"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4697611/","name":"Giedre Zickyte"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0616694/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0403615/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0625441/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1395408/","name":"Josh Alexander","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4697611/","name":"Giedre Zickyte"],"duration":"PT1H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Now people will complain about choosing a different cast then. The cast was final, end of story, get over it. Also unlike a lot of people in here I am really glad they did not change the story from the original. Since it is a remake I don't expect a whole new story that would totally ruin the original. Besides, with the money Disney has made, a 2nd one is definitely coming, you'll get your different story.

I like the fact that they kept the original songs. Unlike a LOT of people in here, I did not mind the autotune because I didn't want to hear the voices of the actors if they were bad. Now people will complain about choosing a different cast then. The cast was final, end of story, get over it. Also unlike a lot of people in here I am really glad they did not change the story from the original. Since it is a remake I don't expect a whole new story that would totally ruin the original. Besides, with the money Disney has made, a 2nd one is definitely coming, you'll get your different story. The visuals were OK but could have been better especially Belle's village.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":290795,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-03-17","keywords":"beast,fairy tale,heroine,beast's heart,remake of oscar winner","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Consideration Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179222553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress.

Nevertheless, it is one of the better sequels I have seen, and it was definitely worth both the price of admission and a third or fourth viewing of the DVD.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":439461,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2004-08-04","keywords":"reference to spider man,ogre,cat,princess,puss in boots","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shrek 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1447231513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhNGQwNjUtYmFlMS00ODdiLWI3YTUtNjViOWYzZmU2YzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGRhNGQwNjUtYmFlMS00ODdiLWI3YTUtNjViOWYzZmU2YzhjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Dreamworks","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000196/","name":"Mike Myers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000552/","name":"Eddie Murphy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011470/","name":"Andrew Adamson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0038432/","name":"Kelly Asbury","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0970447/","name":"Conrad Vernon"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0069464/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0825308/","name":"William Steig","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011470/","name":"Andrew Adamson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0830294/","name":"Joe Stillman"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...\n\nAt other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.\n\nApart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.\n\nAnd, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.\n\nChow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.\n\nThe center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the "Luke Skywalker" of the piece, if you will...though "Crouching Tiger..." has everything the "Star Wars" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.\n\nBy the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the "Full Peckinpaw," if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.\n\nThere are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!\n\nI won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.\n\nMy recommendation: Just go see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This shows all signs of being rushed to capitalize on that modest success, as it basically just reprises the same character with some (but not enough) variations in a more genre-oriented story. The problem is that "Road" was entirely built around his over-the-top character, which was excessive in (almost always) good ways, whereas this time that character's tantrums, childishness, et al. Are less funny, and eat up screentime that would have been better spent fleshing out the horror aspects that instead go underdeveloped. So even as a comedy horror (though the horror isn't exactly comic, and there's no real satire here), the film is imbalanced by too much attention given to a star role that's too close to Cummings' prior one, and which isn't at all usefully integrated into the genre-focused plot.

This shows all signs of being rushed to capitalize on that modest success, as it basically just reprises the same character with some (but not enough) variations in a more genre-oriented story. The problem is that "Road" was entirely built around his over-the-top character, which was excessive in (almost always) good ways, whereas this time that character's tantrums, childishness, et al. Are less funny, and eat up screentime that would have been better spent fleshing out the horror aspects that instead go underdeveloped. So even as a comedy horror (though the horror isn't exactly comic, and there's no real satire here), the film is imbalanced by too much attention given to a star role that's too close to Cummings' prior one, and which isn't at all usefully integrated into the genre-focused plot. Still, he has some filmmaking chops and an interesting sensibility that keep this entertaining, though hopefully his next feature will be better thought out.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16299,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-10-09","keywords":"mountain,snow,investigation,murder,serial killer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3433414937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJlMmMyMDktOTllMC00MzljLWJhNTAtNzQxZmE1ZjdkYzczXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDJlMmMyMDktOTllMC00MzljLWJhNTAtNzQxZmE1ZjdkYzczXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Welcome to Snow Hollow.

I'm an avid movie lover, frequenting the theaters at least twice a week if not more. Something about being able to just sit back in a dark room, with a big screen and great sound. It's just good fun. Movies are enjoyable, not all are realistic and I think that's the point. If I wanted something realistic, I would watch a documentary (which I do on many occasions).\n\nI think a lot of the reviews are being very unfair to this movie. I have seen the original and I loved it. Especially when I first saw it as a kid, it scared the crap out of me. But we have to remember that we are in a new age with different technologies and expectations. I bet that if the original was released for the first time right now, it would have been shot down even more than this "remake." Although I love the original, the effects don't scare me like they used to. And people who complain about the acting and script of the new movie? Come on. It wasn't perfect, but it's nowhere near as bad as others are making it out to be. And Jane Levy was absolutely AMAZING in this film. I would watch this movie over and over again just to see her act.\n\nPeople are judging this movie too harshly. Was this movie enjoyable? Yes. Very much so. Were the effects good? The effects were A+ and the score was magnificent. Would I see it again? Yes. I would go see it again at the movies AND buy it as soon as it's available on Blu Ray.\n\nThis movie is not meant to be a remake of the first, rather a reawakening of an old and classic evil. Watch this movie with an open mind and you will love it. Watch it and compare it to the original? You will hate it, because they are not the same movies. Both were brilliant, but I would be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed this version a lot more than the old one. Acting by Levy was perfect, gore was fantastic, scares were good, and the movie had my attention all the way through.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164368,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2013-04-17","keywords":"demon,forest,zombie,fear,nurse","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2732631577","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY4NDkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExODMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY4NDkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExODMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Five friends head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of a Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods.

I'm an avid movie lover, frequenting the theaters at least twice a week if not more. Something about being able to just sit back in a dark room, with a big screen and great sound. It's just good fun. Movies are enjoyable, not all are realistic and I think that's the point. If I wanted something realistic, I would watch a documentary (which I do on many occasions).\n\nI think a lot of the reviews are being very unfair to this movie. I have seen the original and I loved it. Especially when I first saw it as a kid, it scared the crap out of me. But we have to remember that we are in a new age with different technologies and expectations. I bet that if the original was released for the first time right now, it would have been shot down even more than this "remake." Although I love the original, the effects don't scare me like they used to. And people who complain about the acting and script of the new movie? Come on. It wasn't perfect, but it's nowhere near as bad as others are making it out to be. And Jane Levy was absolutely AMAZING in this film. I would watch this movie over and over again just to see her act.\n\nPeople are judging this movie too harshly. Was this movie enjoyable? Yes. Very much so. Were the effects good? The effects were A+ and the score was magnificent. Would I see it again? Yes. I would go see it again at the movies AND buy it as soon as it's available on Blu Ray.\n\nThis movie is not meant to be a remake of the first, rather a reawakening of an old and classic evil. Watch this movie with an open mind and you will love it. Watch it and compare it to the original? You will hate it, because they are not the same movies. Both were brilliant, but I would be lying if I didn't say that I enjoyed this version a lot more than the old one. Acting by Levy was perfect, gore was fantastic, scares were good, and the movie had my attention all the way through.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164368,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2013-04-17","keywords":"demon,forest,zombie,fear,nurse","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2732631577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY4NDkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExODMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIzMjY4NDkzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODExODMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Five friends head to a remote cabin, where the discovery of a Book of the Dead leads them to unwittingly summon up demons living in the nearby woods.

The streets and bridges of Budapest as the story's setting, the score, the camera work and direction all become together to enchant us as viewers in a somewhat magical mystery-romance piece.\n\nThe storyline and the narrative though, is when the film fails to keep up with those virtues.

But, like "The Phantom Menace," I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was "How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?" rather than "How entertaining is this film overall?" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.\n\nCritics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like "The Wizard of Oz" and "Mary Poppins," are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.\n\nAs a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, "Adventures in Babysitting"), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.\n\nI had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like "Home Alone" and "Mrs. Doubtfire." Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.\n\nBut much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--"Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers"--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.\n\nNot that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.\n\nThe problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary "muggle" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.\n\nAlthough the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.\n\nThe answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.\n\nWhat we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":707053,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-01-16","keywords":"magic,wizard,school of magic,based on novel,orphan","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter Franchise Retrospective","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3286287129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRlYzU0YWMtYTU3My00ZmEyLWE1NzEtZTk1MDNmMzE2N2RhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1pYnJ5YW50._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRlYzU0YWMtYTU3My00ZmEyLWE1NzEtZTk1MDNmMzE2N2RhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1pYnJ5YW50._V1_.jpg","description":""That's why you're famous, Harry, that's why everybody knows your name.

But, like "The Phantom Menace," I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was "How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?" rather than "How entertaining is this film overall?" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.\n\nCritics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like "The Wizard of Oz" and "Mary Poppins," are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.\n\nAs a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done.

In 'Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban', the trio are now thirteen and beginning their Third Year at Hogwarts, under the fear of an escaped criminal who played a part in the deaths of Harry's parents and seems to be stalking the school, preying on Harry.\n\nThe child acting in this film has improved slightly with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint probably faring the best in comparison to their young co-stars. Although he is lumbered with a Ron who has once again been reduced to a comic character, it's a sign of Grint's abilities that he does well without looking embarrassed or too clownish. Dan Radcliffe was still very poor, obviously struggling to portray Harry's darker emotions in a manner that isn't wooden and awkward and and this was very apparent in the scene where he makes an atrocious effort to cry when he finds out his godfather had betrayed his parents to their deaths. while Tom Felton was let down by poor scripting of Draco.\n\nThe adult cast were excellent. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were perfectly cast. Lupin was soft yet stern when needed and you could feel there was a parental rapport between him and Harry, and I couldn't imagine anyone other than David Thewlis in the role. And Gary Oldman was great in depicting Black's determination, mingled with an hysterical madness due to his incarceration in the hellish wizarding prison Azkaban. As for Michael Gambon, who was recast in the role of Dumbledore, I felt he was an improvement. Richard Harris was a gifted actor but his Dumbledore had a cold, aloofness to him whereas Gambon was able to portray the warm, eccentricity of the character without diminishing the power and wisdom of Dumbledore. And the rest of the regular cast, such as Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith, were perfect although we expect no better from them now!\n\nOne of the best aspects of this film is how it no longer pandered to kiddies like the previous two films did. There was a darker, moodier edge to the story and the characters. The wizarding world no longer seemed like a perfect haven and the characters had grown beyond being innocent children; this reflected the book itself since many feel PoA was a turning point in the series where it finally felt like Harry Potter- boy and book- were growing up. The Hogwarts' setting differed from the previous films yet not only was it definitely more faithful to the books but finally it felt as if the castle was in Scotland rather than perpetually sunny Disney Land and this enhanced the mood being set in the film. The clock was a nice touch, linking to the theme of time in the actual storyline, as was the bridge in being a place for Harry to mull over his problems. Also, in many ways, this film could have ended up a muddled mess in regards to the ending but Cuaron handled the Time Turner scenes well.\n\nHowever, there were flaws to the film, which let it down. The characters of Hermione and Draco were poorly scripted so they seemed like two completely different characters from the ones we know and love in the books. Although Watson as an actress has improved since CoS, the main problem with the script is that Hermione is being portrayed as being too cool and cocky compared to the bookworm who has no interest in fashion that we know Hermione to be in the books. Steve Kloves, the scriptwriter who admits he's responsible for the change, really needs to learn heroines don't need to be cool Buffy types to be admired; part of why Hermione is so popular as a character in the books is that she appeals to girls who are bookish themselves and easily identify with her. And as for Draco, he comes across as too much of a cowardly, weak girlie-boy rather than an insidious, vicious brat who can be a threat to Harry when he chooses to. \n\nAlso, there was no telling of what Black did to Snape in school that left him so bitter in his hatred and I wished they'd included the scene where he let slip what Lupin was, especially as this animosity between him, Black and Lupin plays a larger role as the books go on. And speaking of Lupin, the werewolf CGI was atrocious. He looked like an emaciated rat rather than the wolf-like creature who leaves even the more powerful wizards quivering in fear. I wished there was more in the ending too as I would have loved to see Vernon's face when he found out who Black was. Kloves needs to learn how to round the Harry Potter films off properly as this was also a sticking point in CoS.\n\nAt the end of the day, there were scenes left out, some of which we didn't mind skipping but others (an explanation to Harry of James Potter's friendship to Black and Lupin) were sorely missed. It was a great film but it could have done with being made longer or skipping on non-essential scenes (less of the Knight Bus and Hermione punching Malfoy in a manner that makes her out to be a thug) to make way for scenes which are more important. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting something along the lines of RotK but it's still great viewing. I'd give it a seven-and-a-half out of ten with the hopes Cuaron will return to the helm again although preferably not with Kloves as the scriptwriter. I think Cuaron would be excellent working with a script produced by someone who has a better handle on the darker aspects of the books and a deeper understanding of the HP characters.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":585447,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-06-03","keywords":"magic,wizard,werewolf,rat,school of magic","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007761177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

I would say I had pretty low knowledge in films before I first saw Inside Out (not to say that I'm highly intelligent on films now). I only saw about 200 films prior. I hadn't seen a lot of classic films or even know that film can be an art form just through its camera work among other aspects. So you could say that I can't speak for everyone on my views of this film. And you may be right because opinions are subjective anyway.\n\nThis is my favourite film ever.\n\nLike I said above, I didn't see a lot of films that were deemed as masterpieces at that time. While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nYet this is still my favourite film of all-time.\n\n80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.\n\nEver since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).\n\nInside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.\n\nIn the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.\n\nYou can vote "not helpful" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway. This is a beautiful film that will resonate in me always.\n\nI will never forget Inside Out.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":660021,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-17","keywords":"joy,sadness,anger,memory,running away","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Theaters: June 19","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi203730969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inside Out is in theaters on June 19!"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688132/","name":"Amy Poehler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352778/","name":"Bill Hader"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085400/","name":"Lewis Black"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498834/","name":"Meg LeFauve"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

You will cry, laugh and feel amazing after watching this Oscar deserving movie. With some of the best spontaneous singing I've seen in Disney, this musical movie is also a pleasure to your mouse ears.

A worthy Bond film to watch and as long as you don't watch Die Another Day, Pierce Bronson would be join best Bond with Sean Connery.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":195654,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2000-01-09","keywords":"official bond film,007,bilbao spain,femme fatale,false identity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The World Is Not Enough","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2709954841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWIwYzZiNmItZjg1Mi00Y2E1LTg2YjgtNWYzMWMxZDQ4N2IzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWIwYzZiNmItZjg1Mi00Y2E1LTg2YjgtNWYzMWMxZDQ4N2IzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Clip: Caviar Factory And Giant Saw","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000521/","name":"Sophie Marceau","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001015/","name":"Robert Carlyle"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000776/","name":"Michael Apted"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270761/","name":"Bruce Feirstein"],"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Jamie Foxx is Max, a Los Angeles cab driver with dreams of his own limo company, "Island Limo". After twelve years on the job he has become quite gifted at discerning the most intimate details of his passengers' lives... just a glance at their clothes, and he knows.\n\nHis worldly insight manages to tear down the defenses of one of his passengers, a State Attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith, who graces him with her phone number. Max hasn't even begun to revel in the pleasure of possessing the beautiful attorney's digits when he gets his next passenger, Tom Cruise as Vincent, a slick hit-man in town for a night of killing.\n\nWhen a body drops out of a fourth story window and onto Max's cab, he becomes an unwilling partner on Vincent's murder spree.

A bizarre side-note, I know.\n\nAs the movie builds to a climax, the police are hunting for Max, believing he is the one on a killing spree, and Vincent stalks his final victim in a blacked-out high-rise office to a backdrop of the brilliant LA skyline, reflected in multiplicity by the office's dozens of glass cubicles.\n\nTom Cruise, Jamie Foxx, and Jada Pinkett Smith all rise to the occasion in Collateral, and together they transcend their previous appearances on film. Mark Ruffalo gives a good performance as the cop who knows everything is not what it seems.\n\nThere are a few minor plot points which didn't sufficiently suspend my disbelief (like when Max agrees to take Vincent the vicious hit-man to see his Mother in the hospital), but overall this is a fantastic movie.\n\nTroy Dayton","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":381969,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2004-09-08","keywords":"los angeles california,taxi driver,taxi,contract killer,driving at night","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Collateral","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi448725273","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDMzNDEtNzMyNS00M2NlLWJlNDUtOTFiMGNhOWZhYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM0MDMzNDEtNzMyNS00M2NlLWJlNDUtOTFiMGNhOWZhYzEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000586/","name":"Jada Pinkett Smith"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108321/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now years later, Jack is spiralling down, triggered by an unspeakable loss, and drowning in the alcoholism that cost him his marriage and any hope for a better life. When he is asked to coach the basketball team at his alma mater, which has fallen far since his glory days, he reluctantly accepts, surprising no one more than himself.

In high school, he was a basketball phenom with a full university scholarship, when suddenly, for reasons unknown, he walked away from the game, forfeiting his future. Now years later, Jack is spiralling down, triggered by an unspeakable loss, and drowning in the alcoholism that cost him his marriage and any hope for a better life. When he is asked to coach the basketball team at his alma mater, which has fallen far since his glory days, he reluctantly accepts, surprising no one more than himself. As the boys start to come together as a team and win, Jack may have finally found a reason to confront the demons that have derailed him.

After his wife and even the mayor leave for work in St John's, Murray (Brendan Gleeson) thinks up a grand scheme to seduce a doctor to come live in the village. An oil company is looking to build a high-tech plant in the area, but one of the requirements is that the town have a doctor. To get the plant, they also have to get more people and get the cash together for a bribe.\n\nThey force young Paul Lewis (Taylor Kitsch) to come to the village and then try their hardest to please him so that he'll stay. However, it turns out the doctor is into jazz and cricket, cannot fish at all, and has a fiancée back home. Will their plan work? \n\nThis movie worked for me for a number of reasons. Gleeson holds the movie together with a superb performance. The scenery (filmed in Trinity) is gorgeous. The same could be said for Taylor Kitsch, who exudes magnetism and amiability in every scene. He can obviously act but I suspect he was just playing himself in this movie.\n\nInevitably much of the gentle and sometimes ribald humour revolves around the eccentric characteristics of the rural villagers.

After his wife and even the mayor leave for work in St John's, Murray (Brendan Gleeson) thinks up a grand scheme to seduce a doctor to come live in the village. An oil company is looking to build a high-tech plant in the area, but one of the requirements is that the town have a doctor. To get the plant, they also have to get more people and get the cash together for a bribe.\n\nThey force young Paul Lewis (Taylor Kitsch) to come to the village and then try their hardest to please him so that he'll stay. However, it turns out the doctor is into jazz and cricket, cannot fish at all, and has a fiancée back home. Will their plan work? \n\nThis movie worked for me for a number of reasons. Gleeson holds the movie together with a superb performance. The scenery (filmed in Trinity) is gorgeous. The same could be said for Taylor Kitsch, who exudes magnetism and amiability in every scene. He can obviously act but I suspect he was just playing himself in this movie.\n\nInevitably much of the gentle and sometimes ribald humour revolves around the eccentric characteristics of the rural villagers.

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before.

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The L Word is back and it's not bad at all!","reviewBody":"The L Word changed my life. I was a very confused 14 year Colombian girl living in a very small city with my very Catholic family. I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show. Just don't watch it if you don't like it but you can't say it's not a great deal for our community and for us, lesbians.\n\nLesbian, from Lesbos. The origin of the L word is beautiful. Read about Sappho, read her poems. We should be proud of it and we should celebrate it.\n\nWe need more shows like this. Visibility is our best allied, don't forget that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5372,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-08","keywords":"lesbian","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000884/","name":"Jennifer Beals"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0595485/","name":"Katherine Moennig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0354157/","name":"Leisha Hailey"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0886561/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052980/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271093/","name":"Michele Abbott"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149669/","name":"Ilene Chaiken"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271884/","name":"Kathy Greenberg"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3625959449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmYzNGQzZjQtZGYxOS00OTRiLTg2ZDEtYzhhMmQzYzU5NjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmYzNGQzZjQtZGYxOS00OTRiLTg2ZDEtYzhhMmQzYzU5NjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Season 2 is available to stream August 6, 2021 on SHOWTIME."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show. Just don't watch it if you don't like it but you can't say it's not a great deal for our community and for us, lesbians.\n\nLesbian, from Lesbos. The origin of the L word is beautiful. Read about Sappho, read her poems. We should be proud of it and we should celebrate it.\n\nWe need more shows like this.

To my surprise, it did not disappoint.\n\nNow, several years later after having watched all three of these "Rings" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the "Fellowship" film.\n\nAnyway, "Fellowship," stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.\n\nThe story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1743341,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-03-13","keywords":"ring,quest,hobbit,middle earth,epic","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089217/","name":"Orlando Bloom"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

To my surprise, it did not disappoint.\n\nNow, several years later after having watched all three of these "Rings" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the "Fellowship" film.\n\nAnyway, "Fellowship," stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.\n\nThe story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1743341,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-03-13","keywords":"ring,quest,hobbit,middle earth,epic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2073101337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk1MzkwNTA4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTU1ODY3MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The trailer for The Lord of the Rings Trilogy on Blu-ray.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000704/","name":"Elijah Wood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005212/","name":"Ian McKellen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089217/","name":"Orlando Bloom"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046718/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0061706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0866058/","name":"J.R.R.

Seldom have I seen such a fun programme. Yes, fun. This was funny, sexy, violent, bonkers and emotionally truthful in a way that other series fail to achieve.\n\nTo think that this was aiming for any kind of historical accuracy is mad. It was made as an entertainment riffing on possible historical events. The use of modern language, initially jarring, ends up working to its advantage. There's no more reason to dislike modern usage than there is to dislike cod medieval or cod turn of the millennia language. Any language choice is going to be inauthentic so you might as well go for modern vernacular which has the side effect of milking the dialogue for humour. Using Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man for the theme tune is as inspired as using Nick Cave for the theme tune of Peaky Blinders. \n\nYou might also like to note the satirical reference to other well-known franchises and the use of Shakespearian minor characters. The two centurions sampling the "stash" of the witch doctor was comedy gold.\n\nYes, how we all hunger for the certainty of the old days when you knew where you were. When Loved It or Hated It reviews could be searched on and all TV programmes followed the same rules and were as bland as each other. Now all we have left is "helpful" so please regard this review as a provocative Loved It review. No, seriously, I really loved this series and can't wait for the next and I hope I've been really unhelpful in my review.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14253,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2018-01-18","keywords":"soldier,roman army,roman conquest of britain,druid,female warrior","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0607375/","name":"David Morrissey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5732956/","name":"Eleanor Worthington-Cox"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0722279/","name":"Julian Rhind-Tutt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0319272/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165439/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050995/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125336/","name":"Jez Butterworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125358/","name":"Tom Butterworth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0724597/","name":"James Richardson"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Britannia: Ready","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3585458457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJmZTFiNjUtYmI4MS00NzcwLTlmZDctNDkzYTc0Mzk3MjNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzJmZTFiNjUtYmI4MS00NzcwLTlmZDctNDkzYTc0Mzk3MjNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Britannia: Ready"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Miller (Tom Hanks) after they've survived their terrible hours breaking through the first line of German defense, they're given a strange perilous mission, to find one man, Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper who's somewhere behind German lines  For them, it's an abstruse order, but they have to get it done \n\nThroughout the film, Spielberg's attention to detail is amazing  For me, the most chilling scene in the movie is the death of an American officer  It's one of the most intimate  It's also a slightly confusing moment because two German characters resemble each other so greatly \n\nToward the middle, a German soldier called "Steamboat Willie" is introduced  By the end of the film, he has become the 'bad' German  Later in the movie, another German is involved in the final fight  He takes part in an exceedingly painful scene of hand-to-hand combat with the American soldier  The two German soldiers have similar short haircuts and black uniforms  Because they looked so much alike, many of us have believed that they're one character  They're not, and the distinction of the two is very significant","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1303460,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1998-07-24","keywords":"rescue mission,world war two,army,france,unsubtitled foreign language","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Saving Private Ryan","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1701906201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExYjU4OTAtMWM3NS00YzJkLWIzYjQtNTUxMWE5ZWY3MmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExYjU4OTAtMWM3NS00YzJkLWIzYjQtNTUxMWE5ZWY3MmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this wartime drama"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"}],"duration":"PT2H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Miller (Tom Hanks) after they've survived their terrible hours breaking through the first line of German defense, they're given a strange perilous mission, to find one man, Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper who's somewhere behind German lines  For them, it's an abstruse order, but they have to get it done \n\nThroughout the film, Spielberg's attention to detail is amazing  For me, the most chilling scene in the movie is the death of an American officer  It's one of the most intimate  It's also a slightly confusing moment because two German characters resemble each other so greatly \n\nToward the middle, a German soldier called "Steamboat Willie" is introduced  By the end of the film, he has become the 'bad' German  Later in the movie, another German is involved in the final fight  He takes part in an exceedingly painful scene of hand-to-hand combat with the American soldier  The two German soldiers have similar short haircuts and black uniforms  Because they looked so much alike, many of us have believed that they're one character  They're not, and the distinction of the two is very significant","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1303460,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1998-07-24","keywords":"rescue mission,world war two,army,france,unsubtitled foreign language","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Saving Private Ryan","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1701906201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExYjU4OTAtMWM3NS00YzJkLWIzYjQtNTUxMWE5ZWY3MmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExYjU4OTAtMWM3NS00YzJkLWIzYjQtNTUxMWE5ZWY3MmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this wartime drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"],"duration":"PT2H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Bee Movie stands as a decent effort that slowly tries to entice us into its colorful animated world. The story deals with a recently graduated bee named Barry (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld) that begins to feel that there's more to life than working his butt off just to fabricate honey. So he decides to train with the Pollen Jocks whose job is to collect pollen from flowers outside the hive. That's how he gets out to the real world, and after a series of jiggling and accidental events, he is saved by Vanessa (voiced by Renée Zellweger) just as her boyfriend was about to squash him. Barry breaks an extremely important rule of bees: never speak to humans. But he does so knowingly just to thank Vanessa for saving his life. After they get to know each other, Barry finds out and immediately reacts outrageously to the fact that humans eat the very same honey that all the bees in the world work exhaustingly to make, just for the humans to make a profit out of it. This leads to a series of events that result in a catastrophic environmental outcome and it becomes Barry's mission to put it back the way it ought to be.\n\nI'm a big Seinfeld fan, but I gotta say, hearing Jerry's voice coming from an animated bee is something of a bizarre experience, as I didn't think his voice really fit the character, and this off-putting perception made the viewing experience a bit distracting. Seinfeld's voice holds a mature, adult sounding quality to it that it seems inadequate for a young bee fresh out of school. Apart from that, there were some clever jokes and bits like the appearance of Ray Liotta to name one and some obvious ones that should have gone unnoticed for their own sake. Overall I think that is an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half; just immerse youself in the story and try to relate to it, for I'm sure that one of us has felt the way Barry does: unsure about what the future holds concerning job prospects, and worried that it might be the same life day in day out for the rest of your repeated days.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":152397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2007-12-12","keywords":"jazz,larry king character,honey,surrealism,exploitation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bee Movie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi347210009","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MjY3MTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM4NDQ4._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MjY3MTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM4NDQ4._V1_.jpg","description":"Bee Movie Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000632/","name":"Jerry Seinfeld"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000111/","name":"Matthew Broderick"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0971239/","name":"Simon J.

Overall I think that is an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half; just immerse youself in the story and try to relate to it, for I'm sure that one of us has felt the way Barry does: unsure about what the future holds concerning job prospects, and worried that it might be the same life day in day out for the rest of your repeated days.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":152397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2007-12-12","keywords":"jazz,larry king character,honey,surrealism,exploitation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bee Movie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi347210009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MjY3MTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM4NDQ4._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MjY3MTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM4NDQ4._V1_.jpg","description":"Bee Movie Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000632/","name":"Jerry Seinfeld","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000111/","name":"Matthew Broderick"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0971239/","name":"Simon J.

The audacity of what he was attempting, spoofing the industry that was giving him the money to do so, blatantly and lovingly, was too great to ignore. And then there is the cast of stars with cameo after cameo of surprise faces joining in on the fun, not to mention the intense marketing strategy pushing it along. Websites for each fictional actor, a site with clips from the Rain of Madness making of documentary (a Heart of Darkness send up "directed" by co-writer Justin Theroux), and even a faux E! True Hollywood Story to air the week before its premiere in theatres just add to the mythology and attention to detail that went into its making. Now, having finally seen the end result, I must say it didn't let me down. True, I was expecting more in the way of story and plot, especially with all that background info manufactured, but when you get down to it, the entertainment value is off the charts, the one-liners are going to be quoted for years to come, and the laughs come often and hard.\n\nTo take on subject matter as lofty as a send-up to war films, mainly Apocalypse Now, needs a certain amount to bravery and confidence to not care if it all backfires. The production value and effects make this seem as though it is a certified blockbuster falling apart at the seams. Sure the characters are funny and the events on display hilarious, but by the look and feel of the aesthetic, this is a war film to the end. Between that realism and the love I have for meta-narrative, there was little chance Stiller would be bombing in my eyes. Something about movies within movies intrigue the heck out of me, and this one having actors within actors just played up my interest more. There was truly no better way to start this movie then how was done: the playing of Alpa Chino's rap music, consumerism selling commercial and trailers for our three leads' previous films. What better way to be introduced to our action star, our funnyman, and our award winning thespian? Knowing full well the extent of satire going on, each spot delivers, giving a little background into the work these men have done in the past.\n\nDirectly connecting with the subsequent shot, a live scene from the film at hand, the egos finally come out and show face. Jack Black's Jeff Portney reins in his comedian schtick to portray a hardened solider, voice rasping as he shows his serious side; Stiller's Tugg Speedman attempts to revive the action cred he tried to leave behind with his Oscar-bait turn as a mentally handicapped man in Simple Jack, where he went "full retarded, no one ever comes back from that"; and Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus, Australian genius at his craft, playing a black man like he was born one. The scene continues without a hitch, explosions everywhere, screams heard in the distance, and a heartfelt death about to be delivered, until the men show their true colors. Tugg can't make himself cry, (he's just not that good), and Kirk's blubbering and drooling is just so real that the two must partake in a pissing match while effects guru Cody, (the red hot of late Danny McBride), let's loose the one-take only scorched earth fire storm. It's all falling apart and script-writer/former soldier Four Leaf, (the always gruff Nick Nolte), gets the director, (Steve Coogan with one of the best film exits I've ever seen), to agree on guerilla filming, deep in the jungle of foreign lands. Here is where the fun begins and where the movie inside the movie becomes real, or, in effect, the actual moviekind of like "the dude playing the dude, disguised as another dude". The levels at play here are just too many to mention.\n\nBesides a weakly written role for Black, the rest of the men are given enough to work with for some truly great moments. Stiller has a few instances where he returns to his over-long annoying routinepouring "fake" blood into his mouth for onebut for the most part did a real good job, especially with his tough guy poses shooting off his gun. Jay Baruchel shines as the only non-celebrity involved, the guy who went to boot camp, read the novel and the script, and idolizes the men he is working with. Good to see him get a more beefed up role as opposed to the side parts in Apatow films. And the back and forth between Downey Jr. and Brandon T. Jackson's Alpa never get old. The whole dynamic of real black man versus fake was unceasingly funny.\n\nThere were plot points that irked me throughout, TiVo's cameo being the biggest culprit, but I found myself pushing the problems aside and just enjoying the ride. Downey Jr.'s facial expressions, voices, and presence may steal the show, but what really allowed me to forget my worries was an absolutely brilliant cameo from Tom Cruise. His studio executive, pompously crass, loud-mouth made me think of all the horror stories you hear about the Weinsteins, and his dance moves can not be equaled. Tropic Thunder is first and foremost a vehicle for a bunch of friends to have a blast poking fun at their craft and really at themselves. I'll be remembering quotes all night now, thinking that while the story itself doesn't necessitate me watching it again soon, the jokes just might make buying it a must not to mention the wealth of extras that DVD is sure to have.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":396847,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","War"],"datePublished":"2008-08-20","keywords":"film within a film,parody,vietnam,helicopter crash,fake trailer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tropic Thunder","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2139141657","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3OTk1MzYzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU2NDkxMDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3OTk1MzYzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU2NDkxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Tropic"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085312/","name":"Jack Black"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000375/","name":"Robert Downey Jr."}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039303/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245613/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0857620/","name":"Justin Theroux"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1000113/","name":"Etan Cohen"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After the events at Lake Victoria, the pre-historic school of blood-thirsty piranhas make their way into a newly opened waterpark.\n\nYou know, when you're about to watch this kind of movie that you don't have to expect too much and just enjoy the ride. The first 'Piranha'-remake kinda accomplished that. This one started okay - a scene where Gary Busey is looking for his lost cow in the water, turns into an unexpected funny gag. But after we know in which direction this film is taking us - an 'Adults only'-pool with water certified strippers - and the awful acting of several supporting cast members, I knew this wasn't gonna be the good-kinda-bad. \n\nSadly "Piranha 3DD" is more boring than its predecessor and could've been more, if you look at the original 'Piranha' sequel (directed by James Cameron himself). This one just lacks originality.  The director has no idea how to handle this and you can tell in the second half of this film. It's not a comedy nor a self-parody or horror.\n\n"Welcome to rock bottom!"","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41556,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2012-07-14","keywords":"piranha,bare breasts,blonde,water park,bikini","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1902617369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODE5ODU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1MTM3Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODE5ODU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1MTM3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After the events at Lake Victoria, the pre-historic school of blood-thirsty piranhas make their way into a newly opened waterpark.

After the events at Lake Victoria, the pre-historic school of blood-thirsty piranhas make their way into a newly opened waterpark.\n\nYou know, when you're about to watch this kind of movie that you don't have to expect too much and just enjoy the ride. The first 'Piranha'-remake kinda accomplished that. This one started okay - a scene where Gary Busey is looking for his lost cow in the water, turns into an unexpected funny gag. But after we know in which direction this film is taking us - an 'Adults only'-pool with water certified strippers - and the awful acting of several supporting cast members, I knew this wasn't gonna be the good-kinda-bad. \n\nSadly "Piranha 3DD" is more boring than its predecessor and could've been more, if you look at the original 'Piranha' sequel (directed by James Cameron himself). This one just lacks originality.  The director has no idea how to handle this and you can tell in the second half of this film. It's not a comedy nor a self-parody or horror.\n\n"Welcome to rock bottom!"","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41556,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2012-07-14","keywords":"piranha,bare breasts,blonde,water park,bikini","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1902617369","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODE5ODU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1MTM3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODE5ODU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1MTM3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After the events at Lake Victoria, the pre-historic school of blood-thirsty piranhas make their way into a newly opened waterpark.

There was a cartoonish film trilogy in the 1990s. Recently, Michael Bay produced a franchise-reboot as a live action-computer-generated motion capture film. I did not particularly like this very dark 2014 film, rating it only a 5/10. When trailers came out for this sequel though, I already saw that it looked like it was going to be a way better movie than the first one. \n\nThe turtle heroes, along with old pals April O'Neil and Vern Fenwick, and new friend Casey Jones, spring back into action as Shredder was busted from incarceration. The arch-villain had inter- galactically nefarious plans as he conspired with mad scientist Dr. Baxter Stockman to bring into Earth an evil Dimension X being called Krang and his Technodrome in his wild dream of world domination. \n\nThe way the turtles looked in this new film was way better executed. In the first one, they all looked too big, ugly and unwieldy. Their appearance now is more accessible, more in tune with their personalities. Even if the storyline will have their team tested, this was a truly excellent ensemble work among the four actors behind them, imbuing each one with individual charm. They are: Pete Ploszek (as conflicted leader Leonardo), Alan Ritchson (as muscle- bound rebel Raphael), Jeremy Howard (as brainy scientist Donatello) and Noel Fisher (as childlike spirit Michelangelo). \n\nAlso similarly excellent were the CG artwork, performance and the on screen chemistry between the two comical evil side characters, warthog Bebop (Gary Anthony Williams) and the rhino Rocksteady (Stephen Farrelly). They definitely stole their scenes from right under the main bad guy Shredder (Brian Tee), who felt rather lackluster among the other colorful characters of the film. The pinkish brain-like maniacal alien super-villain Krang was portrayed with gruesome glee by Brad Garrett.\n\nThe unconvincing and hammy acting of Megan Fox (as April) and Will Arnett (as Vern) were fortunately buoyed up the excellence of the CGI and story around them. Tyler Perry was an over-the-top nerd as Dr. Stockman, uncomfortably funny. Veteran acting nominee Laura Linney was uncharacteristically stiff as police chief Rebecca Vincent. The best live performer of the film was TV's "Arrow" Stephen Amell as Casey Jones. His graceful physicality (with a hockey stick and skates) and smart-alecky sense of humor made him stand out. \n\nThe look of this new film is so much better than the first one, literally "out of the shadows" where the first one wallowed. There were brighter colors, a lighter mood, a more fun throwback general feel about it. The previous one was too dark and intense, and took itself too seriously, to its own detriment. With this one, we had our beloved Turtles back to the unpretentious way we knew them in our youth. Serious critics may be hard on this one, but I really enjoyed 112 minutes with it, right up to the classic TV cartoon theme song over the closing credits.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88858,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2016-06-29","keywords":"sequel,turtle,based on cartoon,rat,brother brother relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2458694681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NTE2NjcwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1NDA4ODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NTE2NjcwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ1NDA4ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Meet the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as they return to save the city from a dangerous threat."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1083271/","name":"Megan Fox"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1347153/","name":"Tyler Perry"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1757777/","name":"Dave Green"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0032227/","name":"Josh Appelbaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0625858/","name":"André Nemec"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0481990/","name":"Peter Laird"}],"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However free on terrestrial  yeah, I'll take that! So I settled down to something that immediately set itself out to be fresh, slick and light with a jazzy credit sequence and a glossy (without being OTT) little robbery sequence.  So far so good.

It does get a little heavy and slows the film down and the romance between the two leads doesn't quite wash at every turn, but they toy with each other well enough to keep the interest.\n\nThe climax is pretty cool and clever and it is refreshing that the film never falls into big action set pieces to win over the audience  instead keeping it glossy and slick throughout. It is quite something to find a thriller of sorts that is for grown ups and not teenage boys who NEED something to blow up every so often.  The plot here is robust enough to meet the film's needs but is a little too slick to be examined too closely.  But take this as what it is  slick adult popcorn seller  and you'll enjoy it. It is breezy and enjoyable.\n\nAs Crown, Brosnan exudes charm and smoothness but also is able to put an edge on it to show that Crown is not happy even when he has the world. Russo gives a better performance than I've come to expect from her but is still a little out of place in the film.  She isn't totally convincing and I became annoyed by the regular appearance of her tits in the film  did it really help the film I wondered?  Maybe once it was natural in the scene but the rest just seems like a cry for an audience.  Leary does sterling work as Det McCann, although he isn't funny he is a strong serious actor and carries the role well.  The support cast are all pretty good and Dunaway's cameo adds to the slick feeling rather than standing out awkwardly.\n\nOverall this film will please you if you know what to expect.  If you want something wonderful or meaningful then this will let you down.  However, if you're ready for a slick, glossy bit of entertainment that will engage without challenging then this should be more than enough to pass a wet Saturday afternoon."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":90475,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Romance","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1999-11-03","keywords":"sex in bed,sexual desire,female rear nudity,female frontal nudity,lust","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Thomas Crown Affair","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1084556569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA0MTZjMzItOTVmZi00OGRkLThjM2EtYjhjYWE0MDBhMjQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA0MTZjMzItOTVmZi00OGRkLThjM2EtYjhjYWE0MDBhMjQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000623/","name":"Rene Russo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001459/","name":"Denis Leary"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001532/","name":"John McTiernan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088199/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874450/","name":"Alan Trustman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0228908/","name":"Leslie Dixon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The magical component that Stallone achieved was to tell nearly the exact same story, twice in a row, with the same characters... and yet, he gives us a one-two punch that hits just solidly as the first.\n\nIt's truly a remarkable feat. Differences? We've already met all the characters. Gone is the sense of discovery, the sense of learning who these people are. We already know, don't we? Yet, Stallone's characters are sufficiently interesting enough for us to want to spend more time with them, seeing them in a world most of us don't know, living a life few of us would really want. While the sense of discovery about these characters is gone, our joy of being a voyeur into their world is not.\n\nIt's a toss up which movie, "Rocky" or "Rocky II," asks us to suspend disbelief more. In "Rocky," we have to accept that a nobody, unrated, club fighter could a) get the chance to fight the world champion. B) He could possibly defy all odds and go the distance. That's a huge stretch only possible in Hollywood movies, classifying the first movie as a fairy tale along the lines of Cinderella.\n\nSoap opera-esquire is not a bad way to characterize "Rocky II" because of the emotional ride, but I don't find it as trite as a soap opera. Rocky's actions are very believable, from his earnings feeling like a fortune to him (when they were obviously not), to his illiteracy and his unsophisticated, "punch drunk" boxer. The ramifications of his past are believable. He fritters away the money and is unable to capitalize on his 15 minutes of fame. Hey, it happens all the time. Very believable.\n\nWith a pregnant wife, no job, and no way to pay his bills, he's backed into a corner. What's a fighter to do? (And in this case, I mean "a fighter" in its most literal sense.) He's willing to risk his health and even his marriage to do what any man should do: provide for his family.\n\nAdrian's bit of drama is the single "problem" with the movie, but it's also the heart of the movie. It's not a movie about losing it all and coming back again, it's much more than that. It's about a simple man who's trying to do the best he can with the only tools he has. And when Adrian is first to go down for the count, it puts it all in jeopardy.\n\nIt's not until his wife is ready to accept him as he is, for what he is, that he can continue his quest, one more fight, for his family, for himself.\n\nThe story arc feels so similar to the first movie that this one is often tossed to the side, yet it truly is amazing how Stallone managed to re-imagine all the magic of the first movie and, better still, give us a second helping of it that's just as sweet. Enjoy!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200561,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1979-06-15","keywords":"rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,rocky balboa jr character,mickey goldmill character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rocky II","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2087782169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI5MjQ4YmEtMGVhNC00ZTYxLWEzNTctN2YzNTJiODg1OGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI5MjQ4YmEtMGVhNC00ZTYxLWEzNTctN2YzNTJiODg1OGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Rocky II"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054262/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Rocky II: Directed by Sylvester Stallone. With Sylvester Stallone, Talia Shire, Burt Young, Carl Weathers. Rocky struggles in family life after his bout with Apollo Creed, while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0079817/","name":"Rocky II","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGFjMTdmOTktNTJkNi00YWM2LTgzZjYtOWVkMTUyMGNjZDUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjMwNDgzNjc@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rocky struggles in family life after his bout with Apollo Creed, while the embarrassed champ insistently goads him to accept a challenge for a rematch.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0079817/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"kezop_male","dateCreated":"2005-10-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"Same Story, Both Continued AND Re-told","reviewBody":"I'm old enough to remember the thrill of seeing each of the "Rocky" films during their original, theatrical runs. The magical component that Stallone achieved was to tell nearly the exact same story, twice in a row, with the same characters... and yet, he gives us a one-two punch that hits just solidly as the first.\n\nIt's truly a remarkable feat. Differences? We've already met all the characters. Gone is the sense of discovery, the sense of learning who these people are. We already know, don't we? Yet, Stallone's characters are sufficiently interesting enough for us to want to spend more time with them, seeing them in a world most of us don't know, living a life few of us would really want. While the sense of discovery about these characters is gone, our joy of being a voyeur into their world is not.\n\nIt's a toss up which movie, "Rocky" or "Rocky II," asks us to suspend disbelief more. In "Rocky," we have to accept that a nobody, unrated, club fighter could a) get the chance to fight the world champion. B) He could possibly defy all odds and go the distance. That's a huge stretch only possible in Hollywood movies, classifying the first movie as a fairy tale along the lines of Cinderella.\n\nSoap opera-esquire is not a bad way to characterize "Rocky II" because of the emotional ride, but I don't find it as trite as a soap opera. Rocky's actions are very believable, from his earnings feeling like a fortune to him (when they were obviously not), to his illiteracy and his unsophisticated, "punch drunk" boxer. The ramifications of his past are believable. He fritters away the money and is unable to capitalize on his 15 minutes of fame. Hey, it happens all the time. Very believable.\n\nWith a pregnant wife, no job, and no way to pay his bills, he's backed into a corner. What's a fighter to do? (And in this case, I mean "a fighter" in its most literal sense.) He's willing to risk his health and even his marriage to do what any man should do: provide for his family.\n\nAdrian's bit of drama is the single "problem" with the movie, but it's also the heart of the movie. It's not a movie about losing it all and coming back again, it's much more than that. It's about a simple man who's trying to do the best he can with the only tools he has. And when Adrian is first to go down for the count, it puts it all in jeopardy.\n\nIt's not until his wife is ready to accept him as he is, for what he is, that he can continue his quest, one more fight, for his family, for himself.\n\nThe story arc feels so similar to the first movie that this one is often tossed to the side, yet it truly is amazing how Stallone managed to re-imagine all the magic of the first movie and, better still, give us a second helping of it that's just as sweet. Enjoy!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200561,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1979-06-15","keywords":"rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,rocky balboa jr character,mickey goldmill character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rocky II","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2087782169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI5MjQ4YmEtMGVhNC00ZTYxLWEzNTctN2YzNTJiODg1OGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI5MjQ4YmEtMGVhNC00ZTYxLWEzNTctN2YzNTJiODg1OGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Rocky II","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054262/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

There were very few action scenes and those that were were pretty lame and didn't seem well thought-out. It was a classic sci-fi channel movie, completely lacking in real plot development or ability to draw in the audience.\n\nI enjoy sci-fi movies a lot, but only if they aren't garbage. I have watched a lot of garbage, and a lot of fairly good sci-fi movies, including Lord of the Rings and Star Wars of course. I have also watched and loved the Star Trek TV show and movies. I honestly have to say that I would prefer to watch In The Name Of The King, and that movie was terrible. The problem with this movie is that it was boring and did not engage the audience in the least. There was too much talking, especially with big fantasy words that were unnecessary aplenty. It almost seemed as if it was trying too hard. I would rather watch a Dungeons and Dragons movie, because at least they do enough to keep me involved.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1107,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Fantasy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-05-30","keywords":"magic book,arthurian legend,blonde,sword and sorcery,fistfight","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Merlin and the Book of Beasts","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3315401241","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTE2Mzk2YmQtNGNkNi00NmM2LWEwMDgtYzlkZGYwNzA2NTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTE2Mzk2YmQtNGNkNi00NmM2LWEwMDgtYzlkZGYwNzA2NTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Fantasy film trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0130536/","name":"James Callis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0364977/","name":"Laura Harris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1536605/","name":"Jesse Moss"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1284464/","name":"Warren P.

It was a classic sci-fi channel movie, completely lacking in real plot development or ability to draw in the audience.\n\nI enjoy sci-fi movies a lot, but only if they aren't garbage. I have watched a lot of garbage, and a lot of fairly good sci-fi movies, including Lord of the Rings and Star Wars of course. I have also watched and loved the Star Trek TV show and movies. I honestly have to say that I would prefer to watch In The Name Of The King, and that movie was terrible. The problem with this movie is that it was boring and did not engage the audience in the least. There was too much talking, especially with big fantasy words that were unnecessary aplenty. It almost seemed as if it was trying too hard. I would rather watch a Dungeons and Dragons movie, because at least they do enough to keep me involved.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1107,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Fantasy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-05-30","keywords":"magic book,arthurian legend,blonde,sword and sorcery,fistfight","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Merlin and the Book of Beasts","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3315401241","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTE2Mzk2YmQtNGNkNi00NmM2LWEwMDgtYzlkZGYwNzA2NTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTE2Mzk2YmQtNGNkNi00NmM2LWEwMDgtYzlkZGYwNzA2NTkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Fantasy film trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0130536/","name":"James Callis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0364977/","name":"Laura Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1536605/","name":"Jesse Moss"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1284464/","name":"Warren P.

Just too many inconsistencies in the script and the acting was amateur. But like I said it's college material and low budget. I just watched it to see if I would be able to write that I was surprised but in a good way, but I wassn't because I had very low expectations of this crapfest, so I wasn't let down at all. Not recommended at all, unless you are wanting to make films and want to see what mistakes you shouldn't make as far casting, script and directing from the this stink bomb. All others, please don't waste time on this one.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1195,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.4,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2018-05-29","keywords":"airplane,storm,ghost,pilot,flight attendant","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Flight 666","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2913451033","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTcwMzRhZjItZGNmZS00MmUzLTg0YjctYTBkZmEwZTkwOTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTcwMzRhZjItZGNmZS00MmUzLTg0YjctYTBkZmEwZTkwOTYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3336072/","name":"Liz Fenning","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1352774/","name":"Jose Rosete","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3344179/","name":"Joseph Michael Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3973341/","name":"Rob Pallatina"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0369873/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042909/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1043852/","name":"Jacob Cooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5443255/","name":"Brandon Stroud"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Nolte has hired Luis Guzman, a local police officer, to help him in this pursuit and to smooth things over when Nolte disrespects the local populace or their customs. Finally, Valeria Henriquez is quite engaging as the young charmer Lena, who is desperate to join her sister in Minnesota (sold online to a family when they were both in a church orphanage) and will even team up with the "padre" to get there.\n\nWith this good cast and storyline I guess I expected more from this movie, but it lacked dramatic tension and suspense and came across as too flat-toned.

This show DOES NOT try to prove or disprove the paranormal. Nor are the stories even slightly realistic. When you realize that, you will appreciate the show much more. I really don't like the 2-story episodes of season 1. Season 2 is a lot better. Season 2 is all-around stronger, better, and scarier. There are plenty of jump scenes and loads of suspense. This is probably the best "Haunted Documentary" style show on TV. Some episodes are just pure junk, but the "Man in the Attic," "Capitol Theater Haunting," and "The Dybbuk Box" are by far the freakiest and most jumpy episodes.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2595,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"genre":["Documentary","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2011-09-07","keywords":"haunting,poltergeist,two word title,eyewitness account,documentary series","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7025791/","name":"Gillian English","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3266807/","name":"Frances Townend","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3141457/","name":"Daniel Cannis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0178419/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Paranormal Witness","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3941252377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVkMWY4N2YtM2Y2Zi00OGRiLTkwNDUtOWIxZWM4ZDdkMGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVkMWY4N2YtM2Y2Zi00OGRiLTkwNDUtOWIxZWM4ZDdkMGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Paranormal Witness"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="
