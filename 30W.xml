Her parents (Essie Davis and Ben Mendelsohn) are dysfunctional and unraveling and have drug problems of their own.

On the other hand it's one great looking and well directed movie, with a pleasant pace and some good action but on the other it's being a real average one with its story and suffers from some weak acting as well.\n\nIt's actually a movie based on a Belgian novel- and comic-book-series. And it's not really hard to see why they wanted to turn it into a movie-series as well. It has a very typical movie style and way of storytelling to it, that reminds you of movie-series such as the Bourne Identity and James Bond ones. It has a thriller type of plot, hot women, plenty of action and hand-to-hand combat and some exotic locations as well. Yet as a movie this one does not really work out quite successfully. Also financially it was a disappointment but that didn't prevent them from making a sequel, with the poetic title "Largo Winch II", in 2011, which was not much of a success either. So it seems that the series is already over before anybody had really heard about it, unless some big Hollywood studio decides to pick it up and turn it into a movie-series, since the potential is all definitely still present in it.\n\nIt's a movie in which a secretly adopted son has to proof his legitimacy, in order to take over his murdered father's company, that is worth billions and prevent it from falling in the wrong hands of some shady business people. Doesn't sound like the most interesting perhaps and you're right to think so. It's mostly being a Industrial espionage thriller, with backstabbing characters and ones with double agendas, with some action thrown in it to spice up things. It just isn't really the most exciting concept to begin with and besides, the movie its story offers little new or surprising really. It all has been done before and better as well. It's all quite predictable, also in the way it's progressing.\n\nBut the film-makers didn't seemed to be stopped in their ambitions to still create a great movie, despite of its story. It's a real slick looking movie, with a great visual style to it. They also handled the action really well, with some good camera-work and nimble editing. I'm a fan of some good old fashioned hand-to-hand action and this movie has plenty of that. Really, I can't say anything bad about the directing approach of this movie. It also provides the movie with a pleasantly fast pace, which ensures that the movie, despite of its story, won't ever start to bore you.\n\nAnd the movie also needed a fast pace, since it seemed to be covering lots of ground. It's set in many different countries, at many different places, with many different people. Yet they managed to fit it all into a 100 minutes short movie. It might cause you to loose track at times though. I mean, it's quite hard to understand at times why our main character is suddenly in a different country or how he got there in the first place.\n\nBut something that really truly brings this movie down is its acting. Most of the actors really got poorly cast in this and seem to belong on TV or soap operas only really. Kristin Scott Thomas is an exception and Benedict Wong also does a decent enough job but the rest were really struggling to get their lines out convincingly. Perhaps this was also partly due to it that most characters have to speak in many different languages. The movie mostly consists out of French, English and Serbian dialog, while some of the actors themselves aren't even French, English or Serbian. And hearing a French person utter some English words just never really sounds convincing. The lead actor Tomer Sisley was also really struggling with this and only seemed to be in his element during the action sequences.\n\nNot a great movie by any means but still worth giving a go when you have run out of anything else to watch.\n\n6/10 \n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13914,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-10-14","keywords":"2000s,failed brakes,businessman,predatory capitalism,capitalist society","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3991117337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAzMjkyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQyMDQ5Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAzMjkyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQyMDQ5Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After a powerful billionaire is murdered, his secret adoptive son must race to prove his legitimacy, find his father's killers and stop them from taking over his financial empire.

On the other hand it's one great looking and well directed movie, with a pleasant pace and some good action but on the other it's being a real average one with its story and suffers from some weak acting as well.\n\nIt's actually a movie based on a Belgian novel- and comic-book-series. And it's not really hard to see why they wanted to turn it into a movie-series as well. It has a very typical movie style and way of storytelling to it, that reminds you of movie-series such as the Bourne Identity and James Bond ones. It has a thriller type of plot, hot women, plenty of action and hand-to-hand combat and some exotic locations as well. Yet as a movie this one does not really work out quite successfully. Also financially it was a disappointment but that didn't prevent them from making a sequel, with the poetic title "Largo Winch II", in 2011, which was not much of a success either. So it seems that the series is already over before anybody had really heard about it, unless some big Hollywood studio decides to pick it up and turn it into a movie-series, since the potential is all definitely still present in it.\n\nIt's a movie in which a secretly adopted son has to proof his legitimacy, in order to take over his murdered father's company, that is worth billions and prevent it from falling in the wrong hands of some shady business people. Doesn't sound like the most interesting perhaps and you're right to think so. It's mostly being a Industrial espionage thriller, with backstabbing characters and ones with double agendas, with some action thrown in it to spice up things. It just isn't really the most exciting concept to begin with and besides, the movie its story offers little new or surprising really. It all has been done before and better as well. It's all quite predictable, also in the way it's progressing.\n\nBut the film-makers didn't seemed to be stopped in their ambitions to still create a great movie, despite of its story. It's a real slick looking movie, with a great visual style to it. They also handled the action really well, with some good camera-work and nimble editing. I'm a fan of some good old fashioned hand-to-hand action and this movie has plenty of that. Really, I can't say anything bad about the directing approach of this movie. It also provides the movie with a pleasantly fast pace, which ensures that the movie, despite of its story, won't ever start to bore you.\n\nAnd the movie also needed a fast pace, since it seemed to be covering lots of ground. It's set in many different countries, at many different places, with many different people. Yet they managed to fit it all into a 100 minutes short movie. It might cause you to loose track at times though. I mean, it's quite hard to understand at times why our main character is suddenly in a different country or how he got there in the first place.\n\nBut something that really truly brings this movie down is its acting. Most of the actors really got poorly cast in this and seem to belong on TV or soap operas only really. Kristin Scott Thomas is an exception and Benedict Wong also does a decent enough job but the rest were really struggling to get their lines out convincingly. Perhaps this was also partly due to it that most characters have to speak in many different languages. The movie mostly consists out of French, English and Serbian dialog, while some of the actors themselves aren't even French, English or Serbian. And hearing a French person utter some English words just never really sounds convincing. The lead actor Tomer Sisley was also really struggling with this and only seemed to be in his element during the action sequences.\n\nNot a great movie by any means but still worth giving a go when you have run out of anything else to watch.\n\n6/10 \n\nhttp://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13914,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-10-14","keywords":"2000s,failed brakes,businessman,predatory capitalism,capitalist society","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3991117337","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAzMjkyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQyMDQ5Ng@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2NTAzMjkyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODQyMDQ5Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After a powerful billionaire is murdered, his secret adoptive son must race to prove his legitimacy, find his father's killers and stop them from taking over his financial empire.

Is it the love of gambling that drives him to play $70,000 hands?? No, his facial expressions don't change from when he's up 9 million, to when he's gambled away his last $500 chip.  His addiction has no purpose, it's almost as if he is doing this simply to survive.  Hoffman wasn't the only gem in this picture, he was coupled with Minnie Driver who was almost unidentifiable with her dark rimmed glasses and bleached blonde hair (and not a bad Canadian accent eh?).

There's a spooky faceless monster that has been haunting the daughter of John Farrow (Clive Owen). This figure wants to steal her face as she feels he has no identity of his own . John's tried helping his daughter remedy the situation, but each night she still gets a visit from this unwelcomed friend. Things get even spookier once John sees this faceless creature. He's not sure if he's going completely crazy or not, so he installs a security camera . Though no one can see him , Hollow Face lurks in the corners, desperately desiring love but only knowing how to spread fear and hate. He creeps into the life of John Farrow after Farrow's beloved 13-year-old daughter Mia (Ella Purnell) is assaulted in their home . The line between the real and the imaginary blurs as fissures start to open within the family unit . It seems that no security measure can keep Hollow Face out . Furthermore we're initially introduced to Juan (Izán Corchero) a young Spanish boy who, on one rainy night, is attacked by a strange spectre , known as Hollow face , being helped by his mother (Pilar Gomez Ayala) . \n\nThe picture displays mystery, suspense, shocks, grisly terror and eerie scenes when the horrific creature appears . From start to finish the terror and spooky scenes are continuous until a striking ending . The film contains horrifying and hair rising images and a sinister, mysterious atmosphere . It has a couple of twists piled on top of one central twist concerning two children in different countries who are visited nightly by a faceless being and menaced by what seems to be a supernatural presence . Good performance by Clive Owen who stars as John Farrow, a father trying to protect his 13-year-old daughter from the evil entity known as Hollow Face . The acting from Clive Owen , Carice van Houten as his wife , Daniel Bruhl as a priest , Kerry Fox as a Doctor , Hector Alterio as an old priest is much better than the script . Nicolás Casariego and Jaime Marques' screenplay does something strange by the end : it actually removes the stakes of everything that came before with its trio of revelations that at first test and then demolish any credulity the movie had built up by that point. Both of whom manage to create some interest with their dual storytelling style . However , the picture is hampered by a partially fleshed out story that is mostly lacking in horror. Director Fresnadillo throws all of that away in exchange for a terror film without scares, originality or a pulse . Colorful cinematography plenty of lights and shades by excellent cameraman Enrique Chediak . Creepy and thrilling music adjusted to the horror film by Roque Baños . \n\nDirector Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intacto , 28 Weeks Later) isn't exactly a visionary director like the film bills him as, but he is good at approaching films with style and consistent moods . The director made an editing the film was a big challenge , it was a long, complex process because of the story's dual structure. The film will appeal to terror buffs but gets some decent scares with the apparition of the frightening faceless being who wants to take possession of the children.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20552,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-10-07","keywords":"supernatural horror,one word title,breasts,climbing a tree,flashlight","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi758030617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMTI4Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIzMjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMTI4Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIzMjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Two children living in different countries are visited nightly by a faceless being who wants to take possession of them.

Colorful cinematography plenty of lights and shades by excellent cameraman Enrique Chediak . Creepy and thrilling music adjusted to the horror film by Roque Baños . \n\nDirector Juan Carlos Fresnadillo (Intacto , 28 Weeks Later) isn't exactly a visionary director like the film bills him as, but he is good at approaching films with style and consistent moods . The director made an editing the film was a big challenge , it was a long, complex process because of the story's dual structure. The film will appeal to terror buffs but gets some decent scares with the apparition of the frightening faceless being who wants to take possession of the children.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20552,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2011-10-07","keywords":"supernatural horror,one word title,breasts,climbing a tree,flashlight","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi758030617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMTI4Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIzMjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyMTI4Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzIzMjgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Two children living in different countries are visited nightly by a faceless being who wants to take possession of them.

Checking out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with the audio comments on might just blow you away.\n\nThe film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash-landing in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic (Mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel).

The easiest way to tell you about it is to compare it to similar movies, and the first that came to mind were Lucas (Corey Haim) and Rudy (Sean Astin). What Saint Ralph shares in common with these films is the extreme athletic determination, against all odds, of a spirited boy from a pathetic background. And it's the best of it's kind since Rudy (1993), at least, and in my opinion since Lucas (1986).\n\nRalph (Adam Butcher) is a naughty but naive 14-year-old boy, ready to take almost everything literally, now faced with the paradox of faith. His widowed mother is apparently dying in the hospital, and falls into a coma early in the story. A doctor says it will take a miracle to wake her.\n\nRalph is an interesting character, his even blend of pure and impure motives providing both the humor that make the film entertaining, and the realism that make it believable. His self-abuse in every sense defines the term, from the usual meaning to literally sanding his knees to pray in a pan of alcohol, the latter recommended by his girlfriend, who aspires to be a nun.\n\nWhen his Catholic school's cross country coach says it would be a miracle if anyone on his team won the Boston Marathon, Ralph's literal mind seizes a fallacious opportunity. If he wins the Boston Marathon, it would be a miracle, and that's what his mother needs to survive. Most of the movie is about his training to run that race, both physical and spiritual, with the help of a priest (Campbell Scott), a nurse (Jennifer Tilly), and his girlfriend (Tamara Hope).\n\nThe blend of comedy and pathos is effective, the film kept entertaining by the comedy in the foreground, while the fact that Ralph's mother is dying keeps us interested in the outcome and rooting for the boy. Even if you don't like running or sports in general, the life at stake, or at least the boy's faith at stake, makes this race important.\n\nThere may be a bit too much sexual comedy for most parents to let small children see. For instance, after Ralph's caught in a venal sin in the swimming pool, that involved spying on the girl's locker room, he tells his mother "It was really an accident. The manufacture of the pool was faulty." The incident becomes a running joke, demonstrating Ralph's character trait of not caring what other people think. He later says they didn't really need to drain the pool (I'm not going to explain that, you've got to see it, but it was funny). But it's not as crude as other current comedies like The Wedding Crashers and The Bad News Bears.\n\nI recommend Saint Ralph specifically to anyone who liked Lucas or Rudy, and generally to anyone old enough to take the humor maturely.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6018,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2005-04-08","keywords":"doubt,male protagonist,year 1954,character name as title,nickname as title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Saint Ralph","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1619329305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDYwNGEzNWYtNjlhMy00ZGRmLThiYTYtZjk0YzYzMmU2YzU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDYwNGEzNWYtNjlhMy00ZGRmLThiYTYtZjk0YzYzMmU2YzU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Samuel Goldwyn"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124666/","name":"Adam Butcher"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001714/","name":"Campbell Scott"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000236/","name":"Jennifer Tilly"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1313340/","name":"Michael McGowan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072477/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0297908/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1313340/","name":"Michael McGowan"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The easiest way to tell you about it is to compare it to similar movies, and the first that came to mind were Lucas (Corey Haim) and Rudy (Sean Astin). What Saint Ralph shares in common with these films is the extreme athletic determination, against all odds, of a spirited boy from a pathetic background. And it's the best of it's kind since Rudy (1993), at least, and in my opinion since Lucas (1986).\n\nRalph (Adam Butcher) is a naughty but naive 14-year-old boy, ready to take almost everything literally, now faced with the paradox of faith. His widowed mother is apparently dying in the hospital, and falls into a coma early in the story. A doctor says it will take a miracle to wake her.\n\nRalph is an interesting character, his even blend of pure and impure motives providing both the humor that make the film entertaining, and the realism that make it believable. His self-abuse in every sense defines the term, from the usual meaning to literally sanding his knees to pray in a pan of alcohol, the latter recommended by his girlfriend, who aspires to be a nun.\n\nWhen his Catholic school's cross country coach says it would be a miracle if anyone on his team won the Boston Marathon, Ralph's literal mind seizes a fallacious opportunity. If he wins the Boston Marathon, it would be a miracle, and that's what his mother needs to survive. Most of the movie is about his training to run that race, both physical and spiritual, with the help of a priest (Campbell Scott), a nurse (Jennifer Tilly), and his girlfriend (Tamara Hope).\n\nThe blend of comedy and pathos is effective, the film kept entertaining by the comedy in the foreground, while the fact that Ralph's mother is dying keeps us interested in the outcome and rooting for the boy. Even if you don't like running or sports in general, the life at stake, or at least the boy's faith at stake, makes this race important.\n\nThere may be a bit too much sexual comedy for most parents to let small children see. For instance, after Ralph's caught in a venal sin in the swimming pool, that involved spying on the girl's locker room, he tells his mother "It was really an accident. The manufacture of the pool was faulty." The incident becomes a running joke, demonstrating Ralph's character trait of not caring what other people think. He later says they didn't really need to drain the pool (I'm not going to explain that, you've got to see it, but it was funny). But it's not as crude as other current comedies like The Wedding Crashers and The Bad News Bears.\n\nI recommend Saint Ralph specifically to anyone who liked Lucas or Rudy, and generally to anyone old enough to take the humor maturely.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6018,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2005-04-08","keywords":"doubt,male protagonist,year 1954,character name as title,nickname as title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Saint Ralph","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1619329305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDYwNGEzNWYtNjlhMy00ZGRmLThiYTYtZjk0YzYzMmU2YzU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDYwNGEzNWYtNjlhMy00ZGRmLThiYTYtZjk0YzYzMmU2YzU4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Samuel Goldwyn","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124666/","name":"Adam Butcher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001714/","name":"Campbell Scott","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000236/","name":"Jennifer Tilly"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1313340/","name":"Michael McGowan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072477/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0297908/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1313340/","name":"Michael McGowan"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

He calls in a bee expert, she happens to have the hots for our sheriff. Fortunately although the sheriff is married with kids, he is available as it seems that he and his wife are not together any more.\n\nOf course the nasty Mayor who spends his time buying up land from poor farmers will have none of these deadly bee tales.

He calls in a bee expert, she happens to have the hots for our sheriff. Fortunately although the sheriff is married with kids, he is available as it seems that he and his wife are not together any more.\n\nOf course the nasty Mayor who spends his time buying up land from poor farmers will have none of these deadly bee tales.

I personally tend to like anything Adam Sandler is in and this is no exception. \n\nKevin James is his usual goofy self, Chris Rock has done better movies but is still decent in this one. David Spade was average as the whiny singleton. Rob Schneider was okay and Madison Riley as the character of his daughter OMG! Smoking Hot!!! I definitely want to see more of her! I did feel quite old (i'm only 27) when I found out that she was only 20...\n\nAll the acting was up to scratch and there were several hilarious moments.\n\nA feel good, funny, family film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":239141,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-08-04","keywords":"funeral,reunited friends,ash scattering,pregnant wife,pregnant woman","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grown Ups: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3618113305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4MDE0MDAyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjY1ODMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After their high school basketball coach passes away, five good friends and former teammates reunite with their families for a Fourth of July holiday weekend","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0416673/","name":"Kevin James"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

But, that is not why we go to movies anyway, is it? That is like going to see Godzilla expecting to learn something about giant lizards that vomit radioactive spray. Emmerich has taken a fictitious subject he knew would be controversial and woven some drama into it. People who tend to be slightly paranoid will no doubt be even more so after seeing the world destroyed according to interpretations of prophecy. The people who sell the books promoting the fear make money, just like the movie producers. So what? I didn't see this movie to pick up any information I haven't learned from the History Channel, nor do I believe any more than I did before, that anything bad is going to happen on December 21, 2012. Did I go expecting to be highly entertained by great CGI and action? Yes! And I wasn't disappointed! One thing many reviewers haven't been picking up on while watching this movie is the very slight tongue-in-cheekiness of the subject that Emmerich cleverly wove into the plot. He obviously doesn't believe any of the prophecy any more than most of the rest of us do. You can see it in the actors' performances too: Woody Harrelson, to wit. It is the same as a weatherman who can deliver his forecast each night without laughing because he truly doesn't know with certainty what is going to happen, but he tries to make us believe nonetheless.\n\nSee this movie if you love cinema. Enjoy the things about cinema that make it great. Take a small pillow for your butt cheeks because almost 3 hours of sitting in an uncomfortable theater seat will make you wish you had. But fear not. There is so much non-stop action you won't notice the discomfort too much.\n\nThe film has obvious flaws, trite clichés, and phony science, but if you are a fan of 50's sci-fi, you will love this movie. And remember, don't take it too seriously folks, just enjoy it. The end of the world isn't going to happen in 2012, there really aren't any giant grasshoppers, ants, or lizards roaming the Earth, and no one's career is going to end because of their role in this movie. It is Hollywood having a good time with a controversial subject. Nothing new there.\n\nEnjoy the show!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":365682,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-11-11","keywords":"apocalypse,earthquake,end of the world,elizabeth i character,juvenile bedwetting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"2012: Final Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3444113945","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NDQ4MjE5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgzMDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NDQ4MjE5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgzMDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An academic researcher leads a group of people in a fight to counteract the apocalyptic events that were predicted by the ancient Mayan calendar.

 --- Description: 2012: Directed by Roland Emmerich. With John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Thandiwe Newton. A frustrated writer struggles to keep his family alive when a series of global catastrophes threatens to annihilate mankind." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1190080/","name":"2012","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0MjEyODQzMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTczMjQ4Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A frustrated writer struggles to keep his family alive when a series of global catastrophes threatens to annihilate mankind.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1190080/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"polombob","dateCreated":"2009-11-15","inLanguage":"English","name":"It's the end of the world, not anybody's career","reviewBody":"Anybody going to this movie to learn about the Mayan prophecies for 2012 or for any true science, is going to be sadly disappointed. But, that is not why we go to movies anyway, is it? That is like going to see Godzilla expecting to learn something about giant lizards that vomit radioactive spray. Emmerich has taken a fictitious subject he knew would be controversial and woven some drama into it. People who tend to be slightly paranoid will no doubt be even more so after seeing the world destroyed according to interpretations of prophecy. The people who sell the books promoting the fear make money, just like the movie producers. So what? I didn't see this movie to pick up any information I haven't learned from the History Channel, nor do I believe any more than I did before, that anything bad is going to happen on December 21, 2012. Did I go expecting to be highly entertained by great CGI and action? Yes! And I wasn't disappointed! One thing many reviewers haven't been picking up on while watching this movie is the very slight tongue-in-cheekiness of the subject that Emmerich cleverly wove into the plot. He obviously doesn't believe any of the prophecy any more than most of the rest of us do. You can see it in the actors' performances too: Woody Harrelson, to wit. It is the same as a weatherman who can deliver his forecast each night without laughing because he truly doesn't know with certainty what is going to happen, but he tries to make us believe nonetheless.\n\nSee this movie if you love cinema. Enjoy the things about cinema that make it great. Take a small pillow for your butt cheeks because almost 3 hours of sitting in an uncomfortable theater seat will make you wish you had. But fear not. There is so much non-stop action you won't notice the discomfort too much.\n\nThe film has obvious flaws, trite clichés, and phony science, but if you are a fan of 50's sci-fi, you will love this movie. And remember, don't take it too seriously folks, just enjoy it. The end of the world isn't going to happen in 2012, there really aren't any giant grasshoppers, ants, or lizards roaming the Earth, and no one's career is going to end because of their role in this movie. It is Hollywood having a good time with a controversial subject. Nothing new there.\n\nEnjoy the show!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":365682,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2009-11-11","keywords":"apocalypse,earthquake,end of the world,elizabeth i character,juvenile bedwetting","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"2012: Final Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3444113945","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NDQ4MjE5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgzMDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0NDQ4MjE5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODgzMDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"An academic researcher leads a group of people in a fight to counteract the apocalyptic events that were predicted by the ancient Mayan calendar.

Cale (Channing Tatum) is there with his 11 year old daughter Emily (Joey King). Through circumstances Cale saves President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) from being killed and they try to figure a way to beat the terrorists and save the White House.\n\nThis starts out badly. The first half hour deals with character development. Nothing wrong with that--but it's so DULL! Then the action starts up and it picks up. There's plenty of violence--LOTS of shootings but no blood (hence the PG-13 rating). Still it isn't that good. The action is strong and violent but not enough to carry the movie. Also it's far too long and gets stupider as it goes along. Seriously--by the end I was getting insulted as how moronic the film was getting. Also Emily (an 11 year old) is slapped around, threatened and (more than once) has a gun held to her head! That's going too far. Even worse is Tatum's acting. He was blank-faced throughout. On the plus side the special effects were great, Foxx was good as the president, and Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Woods were great in supporting roles. So it was loud and violent but too long and too stupid.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":214451,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"white house,automatic weapon,attempted coup d'etat,stabbed with a pen,beaten to death","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1969202713","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MzE3NjM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM3NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MzE3NjM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM3NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"While on a tour of the White House with his young daughter, a Capitol policeman springs into action to save his child and protect the president from a heavily armed group of paramilitary invaders."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350454/","name":"Maggie Gyllenhaal"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0321082/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Cale (Channing Tatum) is there with his 11 year old daughter Emily (Joey King). Through circumstances Cale saves President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) from being killed and they try to figure a way to beat the terrorists and save the White House.\n\nThis starts out badly. The first half hour deals with character development. Nothing wrong with that--but it's so DULL! Then the action starts up and it picks up. There's plenty of violence--LOTS of shootings but no blood (hence the PG-13 rating). Still it isn't that good. The action is strong and violent but not enough to carry the movie. Also it's far too long and gets stupider as it goes along. Seriously--by the end I was getting insulted as how moronic the film was getting. Also Emily (an 11 year old) is slapped around, threatened and (more than once) has a gun held to her head! That's going too far. Even worse is Tatum's acting. He was blank-faced throughout. On the plus side the special effects were great, Foxx was good as the president, and Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Woods were great in supporting roles. So it was loud and violent but too long and too stupid.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":214451,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"white house,automatic weapon,attempted coup d'etat,stabbed with a pen,beaten to death","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1969202713","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MzE3NjM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM3NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0MzE3NjM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTM3NzAzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"While on a tour of the White House with his young daughter, a Capitol policeman springs into action to save his child and protect the president from a heavily armed group of paramilitary invaders.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004937/","name":"Jamie Foxx","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350454/","name":"Maggie Gyllenhaal"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000386/","name":"Roland Emmerich"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0321082/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050111/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment. It makes a pleasant and wholesome change from the usual fare of adolescent dreams."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45255,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1996-12-20","keywords":"architect,united states,usa,mother son relationship,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"One Fine Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3298689305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926165/","name":"Mae Whitman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001355/","name":"Michael Hoffman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002149/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0195234/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0783559/","name":"Terrel Seltzer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800124/","name":"Ellen Simon"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: One Fine Day: Directed by Michael Hoffman. With Michelle Pfeiffer, George Clooney, Mae Whitman, Alex D. Linz. The lives of two strangers and their young children unexpectedly intersect on one hectic, stressful day in New York City." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0117247/","name":"One Fine Day","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdhMjgxODQtZjNhNS00YjZiLWFmYTAtODZmM2RhM2M3YmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The lives of two strangers and their young children unexpectedly intersect on one hectic, stressful day in New York City.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0117247/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"philipdavies","dateCreated":"2003-08-21","inLanguage":"English","name":"Just occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment ...","reviewBody":"The headlong screwball comedy of this breakneck romance of two stressed-out single parents is a delight from beginning to end. It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment. It makes a pleasant and wholesome change from the usual fare of adolescent dreams.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45255,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1996-12-20","keywords":"architect,united states,usa,mother son relationship,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"One Fine Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3298689305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926165/","name":"Mae Whitman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001355/","name":"Michael Hoffman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002149/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0195234/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0783559/","name":"Terrel Seltzer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800124/","name":"Ellen Simon"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

This film has those items sprinkled throughout. For men like me it's reassuring to have an average looking man win the heart of a gorgeously vivacious woman, even after finding out in real life they've been married more than 10 years. And also for married men it's encouraging to see that a woman is willing to fall in love with that man again after that much time has passed. I became so involved with the passage of this romance I fretted over the director dropping the ball in the final minutes, only to be surprised by one of the most convincing and satisfying endings I've seen.\n\nThose actors that supported the main story also supplied a warmth that left an after taste that was richly enjoyable. My mother told me to never criticise other peoples' cooking, but I so enjoyed the film that those little thoughts didn't come to anything. It's not a complicated story, but importantly it's an interesting story, like a favourite meal I can see myself sitting down to enjoy again and again.\n\nI've done a small number of reviews for films that surprised and unexpectedly delighted me, such that I hope you may feel the same. A realistic 7.5 score feels understated but heartfelt.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2021-04-30","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1365460/","name":"Julia Benson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1193045/","name":"Peter Benson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3379570/","name":"Tori Barban"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1068982/","name":"Claude Desrosiers"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099956/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0228741/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5949587/","name":"Gemma Holdway"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

With the local Spring Festival coming up and the resident cook unavailable to manage the menu, Winona agrees to get her car fixed in time for her audition in exchange for her much needed help in the Inn's kitchen. As she prepares for the festival with Adam, Winona begins to fall in love with New Holland and one of its residents as well." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt13013696/","name":"Seasoned with Love","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcyOWRiZGQtMzk2Ni00ODRjLWJiZTAtOGQxZGNhNTU4NDJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk1NzUwMA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Winona Applegate is on the fast track to becoming a celebrity chef, already running a very successful bistro in Pittsburgh.

This film has those items sprinkled throughout. For men like me it's reassuring to have an average looking man win the heart of a gorgeously vivacious woman, even after finding out in real life they've been married more than 10 years. And also for married men it's encouraging to see that a woman is willing to fall in love with that man again after that much time has passed. I became so involved with the passage of this romance I fretted over the director dropping the ball in the final minutes, only to be surprised by one of the most convincing and satisfying endings I've seen.\n\nThose actors that supported the main story also supplied a warmth that left an after taste that was richly enjoyable. My mother told me to never criticise other peoples' cooking, but I so enjoyed the film that those little thoughts didn't come to anything. It's not a complicated story, but importantly it's an interesting story, like a favourite meal I can see myself sitting down to enjoy again and again.\n\nI've done a small number of reviews for films that surprised and unexpectedly delighted me, such that I hope you may feel the same. A realistic 7.5 score feels understated but heartfelt.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":153,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2021-04-30","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1365460/","name":"Julia Benson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1193045/","name":"Peter Benson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3379570/","name":"Tori Barban"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1068982/","name":"Claude Desrosiers"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099956/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0228741/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5949587/","name":"Gemma Holdway"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.\n\nSpielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.\n\nWhile titled "Lincoln," we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.\n\nOne requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.\n\nWith this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.\n\nBut that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley.

Certainly, the backdrop of a small town and monastery both removes the story from Polish film of the second half of the twentieth century (most films involve one of the two cultural capitals or another prominent city such as Lodz) and tied it to Polish history and tradition (village life and the relationship o the Catholic Church to secular culture share this film's conceptual center). In addition to this, the content and themes in Jasminum interweave with those previously taken up by other Polish directors, most notably the theme of artist and artistic attitudes existing in conflict with religion and politics (addressed by Wajda in Man of Marble and engaged even in such blockbuster classics as Da Vinci) and the motif of broken or frustrated love and philosophical estrangement.\n\nIt is true that in Jasminum Kolski gives these topics a fresh airing, reinvigorating them with a slightly off-kilter, quirky narrative point of view and an enchanting cast (though Linda might have been better employed in a more demanding role). Everything from the botanically derived names of the candidates for sainthood down to the cinematographic details of verbal and visual perspective (the chiaroscuro lighting, music in the underground vault scene and knowing 'but-not-supposed-to-know' childishness of the narrator's commentary) adds to the eclectic atmosphere of this love drama. And whether Kolski was successful or not in pulling in off, a love drama it was apparently meant to be.\n\nThe film's preoccupation with smell would seem to provide some clue as to the director's essential vision of this tale of love. The heroine (whose tale is, charmingly, told by her daughter) discover piece by piece the secrets of the saints of older days and even of the monks currently living in the cloister. Birdcherry, Plum, Roch--finally, jasmine, the very 'heart' of love, as we find out along with Natasha--all provide the scent-addicted ladies of the town with something so essential they seem unable to bear life without it. What magic do these fragrances conceal, making them so seductive? It would seem they offer their wearers a certain distillation of the life-force itself, an irresistible attractiveness, self-confidence and perhaps most of all a renewed sense of life's possibilities. They transform reality in accordance with the wearer's will in the concentrations appropriate not to weakness but to saintly strength, fortitude and charity.\n\nHowever, in the end it is the humblest of the monks--Sanitas--who, though tempted by the glory in a new pair of glossy boots, cherished his relationship with little Eugenia, the narrator, and with other small, helpless creatures above all else. While each of the monks is portrayed sympathetically through Kolski's lens (even Birdcherry, the source of Natasha's bitterness), the most penetrating and genuinely touching aspect of this narrative is the growing attachment between an old man and a little girl who, it turns out, have more in common than each originally believes.\n\nThe mother--the ostensible heroine, as she is verbally depicted by Eugenia--has her own tale, forming a second stratum of the film's treatment of love. Hers is a story of disappointment and bitterness distilled over time, and it is only slightly mitigated through her meeting with her runaway fiancée. While Natasha's unwillingness to place her own trust in a love potion (as does her own disciple) and consequent search for 'oblivion' in another concoction reveal her veiled motivation for working in the cloister, they also complicate and add a sense of authenticity to her character.\n\nI wholeheartedly agree with the online review that bravely call the movie 'weak'--in the sense that what at heart is meant to be a love story is to a great extent undermined by the secondary plot involving Boleslaw Linda. In the layer of Kolski's message love is portrayed exclusively as sex without much elaboration, forcing Linda and his stage partner into somewhat superficial roles. Even if by this Kolski is merely attempting to represent various attitudes to love and the way individuals are taken by surprise, he fails to provide the internal logic of the rapidly-developing and 'out of the blue' relationship that evidently blossoms into marital bliss.\n\nWhile Jasminum's atmosphere is engaging and the plot thought-provoking, I ultimately find it a mite contrived and more than a little bit mystifying. I would like to see this very deservingly popular director channel his energies towards even more of these 'modern fairy tales' (bajki), provided he remains faithful to the human reality as well...meaning, just as many fantastic oddities but alongside them a more nuanced and carefully handled human component."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1280,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-05-05","keywords":"voice over narration,woman beater,sex,scent,runaway groom","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2702136/","name":"Justyna Bartoszewicz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0088111/","name":"Grazyna Blecka-Kolska"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0196449/","name":"Marta Dabrowska"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464383/","name":"Jan Jakub Kolski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004670/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464383/","name":"Jan Jakub Kolski"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As the American Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0443272/","name":"Lincoln","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNzczMDUyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM2ODEzOA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As the American Civil War continues to rage, America's president struggles with continuing carnage on the battlefield as he fights with many inside his own cabinet on the decision to emancipate the slaves.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0443272/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"StevePulaski"},"dateCreated":"2012-11-17","inLanguage":"English","name":"A capsule of a great president and a director's increasing maturity","reviewBody":"Daniel Day-Lewis is something of an unsung miracle; the man will come out of nowhere, select an unlikely role, knock it out of the park, then quietly crawl back into the ground for the next three or four years before repeating the same process. He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.\n\nSpielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.\n\nWhile titled "Lincoln," we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.\n\nOne requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.\n\nWith this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.\n\nBut that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley.

I love them really a lot, especially the original but I also love the 3rd installment, mainly due to the chemistry between Jackson and Willis. That was phenomenal. I could not connect with much in the 4th movie as it was a lot of CGI and made John McClane a superhero who seemed invincible. I wasn't setting my standards high for this one at all as I knew what it could turn out to be, but BOY...This movie really is awful \n\nThis movie is based around John McClane who travels to Russia to deal with his son's issues. There, a whole lot of crap begins to happen. This movie attempts to have such a complex plot for a Die Hard whereas the other four were so simple that even the dumbest person could tell what was happening. Its like this director, the guy who made the god awful Max Payne thought that the plot had to be complex for an action film like Die Hard As a regular movie, this movie may NOT be that bad but as a Die Hard movie, it is god awful. I couldn't bear to watch the pain that I went through in this film, why? Because, almost nothing in this movie resembled anything about Die Hard. There was no tone, no tension and as a result, it felt nothing like Die Hard. NOTHING! \n\nThe characters really are all awful, with the exception of John McClane who still has a bit of relatability to him. Bruce Willis does a fantastic job in the movie but every other member of the cast really didn't appeal to me. The villain was weak, John's son was uninteresting and a lame addition to the franchise, as if he were there to sell action figures. The story was no fun and the action was all messy This movie does absolutely nothing to resemble the Die Hard films and as such, one of the most anticipated movies of 2013 has fallen down a drain with overuse of CGI, lame characters and plot, uninteresting villain with no real intention and another excuse to make more money out of it.\n\nA Good day to Die Hard is a movie that makes you think that this day is a good day for you to die hard. Do not watch it, pointless action movie that does not resemble Die Hard.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":203162,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-02-14","keywords":"john mcclane character,repeat sequel,subjective camera,john f. kennedy international airport,taxi","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1541121817","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4OTExMjg4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUyMzE5OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4OTExMjg4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUyMzE5OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"John McClane travels to Russia to help out his seemingly wayward son, Jack, only to discover that Jack is a CIA operative working to prevent a nuclear-weapons heist, causing the father and son to team up against underworld forces.

I love them really a lot, especially the original but I also love the 3rd installment, mainly due to the chemistry between Jackson and Willis. That was phenomenal. I could not connect with much in the 4th movie as it was a lot of CGI and made John McClane a superhero who seemed invincible. I wasn't setting my standards high for this one at all as I knew what it could turn out to be, but BOY...This movie really is awful \n\nThis movie is based around John McClane who travels to Russia to deal with his son's issues. There, a whole lot of crap begins to happen. This movie attempts to have such a complex plot for a Die Hard whereas the other four were so simple that even the dumbest person could tell what was happening. Its like this director, the guy who made the god awful Max Payne thought that the plot had to be complex for an action film like Die Hard As a regular movie, this movie may NOT be that bad but as a Die Hard movie, it is god awful. I couldn't bear to watch the pain that I went through in this film, why? Because, almost nothing in this movie resembled anything about Die Hard. There was no tone, no tension and as a result, it felt nothing like Die Hard. NOTHING! \n\nThe characters really are all awful, with the exception of John McClane who still has a bit of relatability to him. Bruce Willis does a fantastic job in the movie but every other member of the cast really didn't appeal to me. The villain was weak, John's son was uninteresting and a lame addition to the franchise, as if he were there to sell action figures. The story was no fun and the action was all messy This movie does absolutely nothing to resemble the Die Hard films and as such, one of the most anticipated movies of 2013 has fallen down a drain with overuse of CGI, lame characters and plot, uninteresting villain with no real intention and another excuse to make more money out of it.\n\nA Good day to Die Hard is a movie that makes you think that this day is a good day for you to die hard. Do not watch it, pointless action movie that does not resemble Die Hard.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":203162,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-02-14","keywords":"john mcclane character,repeat sequel,subjective camera,john f. kennedy international airport,taxi","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1541121817","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4OTExMjg4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUyMzE5OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4OTExMjg4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMzUyMzE5OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"John McClane travels to Russia to help out his seemingly wayward son, Jack, only to discover that Jack is a CIA operative working to prevent a nuclear-weapons heist, causing the father and son to team up against underworld forces.

Każdy myśli, że został wybrany ze względu na swoje zdolności. Tymczasem okazuje się, że bliscy mają już dość przesolonej lasagne, mdłej pomidorówki lub twardych schabowych, ale boją się powiedzieć to wprost kucharzowi amatorowi. Znany szef kuchni Andrzej Polan ocenia umiejętności swoich gości i pomaga im podszkolić się w trudnej sztuce gotowania.</desc>

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all.

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment. It makes a pleasant and wholesome change from the usual fare of adolescent dreams.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45255,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1996-12-20","keywords":"architect,united states,usa,mother son relationship,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"One Fine Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3298689305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926165/","name":"Mae Whitman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001355/","name":"Michael Hoffman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002149/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0195234/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0783559/","name":"Terrel Seltzer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800124/","name":"Ellen Simon"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

This film has those items sprinkled throughout. For men like me it's reassuring to have an average looking man win the heart of a gorgeously vivacious woman, even after finding out in real life they've been married more than 10 years. And also for married men it's encouraging to see that a woman is willing to fall in love with that man again after that much time has passed. I became so involved with the passage of this romance I fretted over the director dropping the ball in the final minutes, only to be surprised by one of the most convincing and satisfying endings I've seen.\n\nThose actors that supported the main story also supplied a warmth that left an after taste that was richly enjoyable.

 --- Description: Seasoned with Love: Directed by Claude Desrosiers. With Julia Benson, Peter Benson, Tori Barban, Kolton Stewart. Winona Applegate is on the fast track to becoming a celebrity chef, already running a very successful bistro in Pittsburgh. With nerves building, she leaves for New York to audition for her own show in front of television executives. Unfortunately, her car breaks down near New Holland, a small, quirky town where Winona rents a room at a local inn run by Adam, a widower. With the local Spring Festival coming up and the resident cook unavailable to manage the menu, Winona agrees to get her car fixed in time for her audition in exchange for her much needed help in the Inn's kitchen. As she prepares for the festival with Adam, Winona begins to fall in love with New Holland and one of its residents as well." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt13013696/","name":"Seasoned with Love","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzcyOWRiZGQtMzk2Ni00ODRjLWJiZTAtOGQxZGNhNTU4NDJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk1NzUwMA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Winona Applegate is on the fast track to becoming a celebrity chef, already running a very successful bistro in Pittsburgh.

This film has those items sprinkled throughout. For men like me it's reassuring to have an average looking man win the heart of a gorgeously vivacious woman, even after finding out in real life they've been married more than 10 years. And also for married men it's encouraging to see that a woman is willing to fall in love with that man again after that much time has passed. I became so involved with the passage of this romance I fretted over the director dropping the ball in the final minutes, only to be surprised by one of the most convincing and satisfying endings I've seen.\n\nThose actors that supported the main story also supplied a warmth that left an after taste that was richly enjoyable. My mother told me to never criticise other peoples' cooking, but I so enjoyed the film that those little thoughts didn't come to anything. It's not a complicated story, but importantly it's an interesting story, like a favourite meal I can see myself sitting down to enjoy again and again.\n\nI've done a small number of reviews for films that surprised and unexpectedly delighted me, such that I hope you may feel the same.

No running water , a heating which breaks down ,pupils who do not care about what he teaches.Boisterous children who do not feel like going to secondary schools , because it would be a waste of time :every boy's ambition is to become a hunter ,and if he does not learn at an early age ,he will never be able to learn the tricks of the trade.\n\nSo what about learning history ,Luther and the Reformed religion?In a convential movie, the teacher would bring his reluctant students to "true" knowledge .The young Inuits eventually come to dominate their teacher : little by little, his way of life comes to resemble theirs,not the other way about .\n\nThus revivified by the people he wanted to educate (and their parents who were not really friendly,nay hostile :the lady hardly thanks the teacher who helped her boy to carry the heavy can ),he feels the "call of the wild" :then the movie becomes almost entirely a documentary (which it was, in parts,since the very beginning).\n\nThere are wonderful scenes of seal hunting ,with a snow storm which forces the men to build an igloo (which was always a shelter during the hunting time,and not a house where they live,as many children still think!);we are treated to the delight of an aurora borealis ;we are told an old legend , an "Hansel and Gretel" for Inuit kids;and because life is made of small pleasures and big griefs, we attend two funerals .(the minister is a woman ,which may puzzle some Catholic viewers.)\n\n"Une Année" Polaire "(which in French sounds like "Scolaire " (school year),it's all this and more ;a great way to go off the beaten track of the French cinema .\n\nLike this ?

It's not the most original or best film out there, but it was a romantic and beautiful story that was very delightful to watch.

Confusing psychodrama and reality as if there is no difference says something disturbing about the Japanese sense of self. Any Westerner would find such a practice a disturbing and offensive intrusion into and offensive parody of their personal integrity.\n\nIn the West we can accept role-playing dramas, which often have satisfying or even cathartic effects, because the illusion is a temporary imaginary leap, and the experience an exercise in self-analysis and mindfulness. Lessons are drawn which can be applied back in one's real life, having been a recreation that strengthens our emotional life, just as physical exercise strengthens our body. Well-written dramas can also impart this kind of creative refreshment. But the Japanese acceptance of play-acting as essentially indistinguishable from actuality, and as having the identical moral standing of authentic behaviour, is surely a dangerous category confusion? This seems to be exposed as the film shows the difficulty the man finds in posing convincingly as the father of a young child while at the same time keeping his emotional distance - as it is stipulated he must as a condition of his employment. One thinks in the West of those unpleasant consequences where undercover security operations have led to the betrayal of the emotions and the lives of partners whom agents have fallen in love with, even married and had children by, in the guise of an entirely false persona. Court cases have tended to follow.\n\nOne can speculate that this disturbing insincerity, which can so easily turn into real but still cheating feelings, is only tolerable in a society and culture that within living memory was still highly formalised according to strict traditional imperatives, that dictated not only the physical but also, to an extreme degree, the interior life of the people. This deprived thought and action of any moral component, producing a culture - as is well known - of shame, instead of guilt; of dissimulation, not confession.\n\nA society that recently valued only mere correct appearance remains vulnerable to such imposture, treating what we would deem impostors and deceivers exactly like authentic persons. If the Japanese still lack, to some degree, the moral centre to distinguish between mere artifice and psychological integrity, then their obsession with automata as acceptable simulacra of human beings, even without application of any Turing test to demonstrate actual sentience, is indicative.\n\nI don't say the Japanese have no modern sensibility, of course. After the terrible debacle, in the Second World War, of their unique traditional world-view, they have finally entered the moral universe. However, it seems they do retain a residual psychological tendency that remains susceptible to mere appearances. This has led them seriously astray (I suggest) in the current practice, as it is shown by this interesting Herzog film, 'Family Romance.'","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2313,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-07-03","keywords":"father,rent,japan,cherry blossom,taking a photograph","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1826995225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVkYjI1NzQtY2ZlOC00NzQyLWJjN2ItYmEzZDIxNWFiMWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVkYjI1NzQtY2ZlOC00NzQyLWJjN2ItYmEzZDIxNWFiMWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A man is hired to impersonate the missing father of a 12 year old girl."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10348089/","name":"Ishii Yuichi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10640857/","name":"Mahiro Tanimoto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11334855/","name":"Miki Fujimaki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001348/","name":"Werner Herzog"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0361457/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001348/","name":"Werner Herzog"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Confusing psychodrama and reality as if there is no difference says something disturbing about the Japanese sense of self. Any Westerner would find such a practice a disturbing and offensive intrusion into and offensive parody of their personal integrity.\n\nIn the West we can accept role-playing dramas, which often have satisfying or even cathartic effects, because the illusion is a temporary imaginary leap, and the experience an exercise in self-analysis and mindfulness. Lessons are drawn which can be applied back in one's real life, having been a recreation that strengthens our emotional life, just as physical exercise strengthens our body. Well-written dramas can also impart this kind of creative refreshment. But the Japanese acceptance of play-acting as essentially indistinguishable from actuality, and as having the identical moral standing of authentic behaviour, is surely a dangerous category confusion? This seems to be exposed as the film shows the difficulty the man finds in posing convincingly as the father of a young child while at the same time keeping his emotional distance - as it is stipulated he must as a condition of his employment. One thinks in the West of those unpleasant consequences where undercover security operations have led to the betrayal of the emotions and the lives of partners whom agents have fallen in love with, even married and had children by, in the guise of an entirely false persona. Court cases have tended to follow.\n\nOne can speculate that this disturbing insincerity, which can so easily turn into real but still cheating feelings, is only tolerable in a society and culture that within living memory was still highly formalised according to strict traditional imperatives, that dictated not only the physical but also, to an extreme degree, the interior life of the people. This deprived thought and action of any moral component, producing a culture - as is well known - of shame, instead of guilt; of dissimulation, not confession.\n\nA society that recently valued only mere correct appearance remains vulnerable to such imposture, treating what we would deem impostors and deceivers exactly like authentic persons. If the Japanese still lack, to some degree, the moral centre to distinguish between mere artifice and psychological integrity, then their obsession with automata as acceptable simulacra of human beings, even without application of any Turing test to demonstrate actual sentience, is indicative.\n\nI don't say the Japanese have no modern sensibility, of course. After the terrible debacle, in the Second World War, of their unique traditional world-view, they have finally entered the moral universe. However, it seems they do retain a residual psychological tendency that remains susceptible to mere appearances. This has led them seriously astray (I suggest) in the current practice, as it is shown by this interesting Herzog film, 'Family Romance.'","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2313,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-07-03","keywords":"father,rent,japan,cherry blossom,taking a photograph","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1826995225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVkYjI1NzQtY2ZlOC00NzQyLWJjN2ItYmEzZDIxNWFiMWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVkYjI1NzQtY2ZlOC00NzQyLWJjN2ItYmEzZDIxNWFiMWNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A man is hired to impersonate the missing father of a 12 year old girl.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10348089/","name":"Ishii Yuichi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10640857/","name":"Mahiro Tanimoto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11334855/","name":"Miki Fujimaki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001348/","name":"Werner Herzog"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0361457/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001348/","name":"Werner Herzog"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Overcoming the bullying about his status in the playground and finding love in a classmate, teacher, father, and alien are enough for most of us in a lifetime.\n\nChow handles the eccentric material with ease as he minimizes CGI and marginalizes himself for the impressive talents of young Jiao Xu (actually a girl) as the growing-up-fast Dickey.

The animation is surreal and enjoyable as always, the voice-acting is tried and true, and everyone in the theater seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. \n\nMild drug use is recommended for optimal viewing and humor extraction. \n\nRead the full review and others like it on the Drive-In Zeppelin website.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52775,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-30","keywords":"dinosaur,formula,plankton,secret formula,bubble","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi421768985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After spending his entire life under the sea in the Bikini Bottom Gulch, Spongebob, Patrick and the rest of their friends go on a quest to find the stolen recipe for their Krabby Patty burgers, which brings them into our world, where they encounter a nefarious pirate named Burger-Beard.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444786/","name":"Tom Kenny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0265067/","name":"Bill Fagerbakke"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1196684/","name":"Paul Tibbitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593610/","name":"Mike Mitchell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390995/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020957/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0008743/","name":"Jonathan Aibel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0074184/","name":"Glenn Berger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384864/","name":"Stephen Hillenburg"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The owner, Nathan, pretty much created a search engine but he's gone a step further by creating an artificial intelligent woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) who the programmer is supposed to examine and question.\n\nEX MACHINA pretty much came out of nowhere and became a good hit across the world and I'm rather shocked that it did. Usually dumb science fiction movies with a lot of mindless actions are the ones that make money and not those that features very little to no action and instead just dialogue and thought. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it asks more questions than anything else and it expects the viewer to think about those questions and the impact that certain actions could have.\n\nThe visual style of the film is quite impressive and it's certainly a very interesting film to just look at. The music score is quite haunting and perfectly captures the mood of the film. There's the terrific cinematography that pulls you into the setting. The special effects are also extremely impressive. I loved the set and the look of this compound but the special effects are the real star. If you didn't believe that you were really looking at and operating with real artificial intelligent creatures then the entire film just wouldn't have the same feeling.\n\nThen there are the performances, which are a major plus.

The owner, Nathan, pretty much created a search engine but he's gone a step further by creating an artificial intelligent woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) who the programmer is supposed to examine and question.\n\nEX MACHINA pretty much came out of nowhere and became a good hit across the world and I'm rather shocked that it did. Usually dumb science fiction movies with a lot of mindless actions are the ones that make money and not those that features very little to no action and instead just dialogue and thought. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it asks more questions than anything else and it expects the viewer to think about those questions and the impact that certain actions could have.\n\nThe visual style of the film is quite impressive and it's certainly a very interesting film to just look at. The music score is quite haunting and perfectly captures the mood of the film. There's the terrific cinematography that pulls you into the setting. The special effects are also extremely impressive. I loved the set and the look of this compound but the special effects are the real star. If you didn't believe that you were really looking at and operating with real artificial intelligent creatures then the entire film just wouldn't have the same feeling.\n\nThen there are the performances, which are a major plus. Gleeson pretty much plays the role that is typically a nerd but the film never lowers the character to that simple term and instead makes him a very interesting person. Even the role of the billionaire played by Isaac isn't what you'd typically see and the actor brings a certainly coldness to the part.

The animation is surreal and enjoyable as always, the voice-acting is tried and true, and everyone in the theater seemed to enjoy it thoroughly. \n\nMild drug use is recommended for optimal viewing and humor extraction. \n\nRead the full review and others like it on the Drive-In Zeppelin website.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52775,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-30","keywords":"dinosaur,formula,plankton,secret formula,bubble","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi421768985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After spending his entire life under the sea in the Bikini Bottom Gulch, Spongebob, Patrick and the rest of their friends go on a quest to find the stolen recipe for their Krabby Patty burgers, which brings them into our world, where they encounter a nefarious pirate named Burger-Beard.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444786/","name":"Tom Kenny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0265067/","name":"Bill Fagerbakke"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1196684/","name":"Paul Tibbitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593610/","name":"Mike Mitchell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390995/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020957/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0008743/","name":"Jonathan Aibel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0074184/","name":"Glenn Berger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384864/","name":"Stephen Hillenburg"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Masterful storytelling when combined with expert filmmaking is a treasure to be appreciated and enjoyed, even if the story is not so pleasant. Such is the case with this gem from writer-director Karim Ainouz, who adapted the screenplay with Murilo Hauser and Ines Bortagaray from the novel "The Invisible Life of Euridice Gusmao" by Martha Bathala. Based in Rio de Janiero, the film blends the vibrant colors of the area with the traditional and restrictive Latin American family expectations of the 1950's.\n\nThe story spans 5 or 6 decades, and when we first meet sisters Euridice and Guida, it's clear they share a tight emotional bond that goes deeper than blood. Though their personalities differ greatly, they are both ahead of their time and out of step with the conventions of the era. Euridice (a strong performance by Carol Duarte) longs for independence and aspires to be a concert pianist after a hoped-for Conservatory in Vienna, while Guida (a powerhouse Julia Stockler) is a dreamer seeking true love, and whose party girl ways must be kept hidden from their conservative father. Both young ladies are spirited, yet respectful.\n\nTheir lives are forever altered when Guida runs off to Greece with her sailor lover. As is too often the case with young dreamers, she returns home once her spontaneous choices prove to be poor judgment. Her father rejects his pregnant daughter since, in his eyes, she has disgraced the family. The parents mislead Guida about her sister's whereabouts, so Guida assumes Euridice is off at conservatory fulfilling her dreams. This sets Guida off on her own solitary path.\n\nIn actuality, Euridice has married and experienced one of the worst ever wedding nights, featuring what is likely cinema's most unsexy bathroom lovemaking scene. There is an element of horror films to this segment of the film, as the sisters are living their worst nightmares, while being separated from each other ... unable to communicate. The male-dominated Latin culture and family traditions prevent their mother from 'disobeying' the father's order, so the cruel lie continues as the sisters unknowingly live their lives within the same town. There is even one excruciatingly painful-to-watch scene that finds them in the same restaurant at the same time, yet oblivious to the presence of the other.\n\nEach woman's inner-strength pushes them forward. Guida (now Gisele) befriends a wise former prostitute Filomena (an excellent Barbara Santos) who becomes her mentor in poverty. Euridice tries to make the best of her situation while keeping her dream alive. Mostly what we have is a tragic story without one specific tragedy - other than the daughter spurned by her father. There are so many moments of pain and frustration, with undelivered mail being among the worst. The film is beautifully shot by cinematographer Helene Louvart, and it reminds us that 'life happens', and it's not all love and Bach.

In fact, this movie should be in the Top 100. Everything about it works, the cinematography, the locations, the acting, the story and this is Robert Zemeckis' greatest showpiece. Tom Hanks has done some bad roles over the years but this is as brilliant as any Jimmy Stewart performance captured on film.

I did not want to see this movie, and wouldn't have under any other circumstances but my friend really wanted to and the tickets were free so I went. \n\nReview itself: This is of no disrespect to Jonah Hill, his fashion of humor or his fans at all, but I, personally have grown tired of what seems to now be a plethora of wanna be Hangover and Superbad's. (The success of Project X seriously worries me...). Anyways, having that mind set approaching tonight and considering the fact I didn't laugh once during the 21 JS trailer, green or red band... I really wasn't expecting all that much out of the experience aside from leaving the house and catching up with a buddy. \n\nBut damn. \n\nI honestly thought this movie was great. Yes, there were parts I wasn't fond of... a bit of the dialogue seemed to me to be vulgar strictly for the sake of being vulgar... there was the usual expected Jonah Hill trademarked myriad of penis jokes and one extremely unnecessary shock gag but the majority of the movie was, to me, surprisingly satirical/smart/relevant in today's society, self-aware, and situationally hilarious. Even the dumbest and most profane of this movie's jokes and clichés seemed to know that they were such and were given the proper comedic build up/context to at least warrant a chuckle. This movie had some surprisingly clever dialogue throughout and some of the best supporting characters I've seen in recent comedies (Ice Cube, The Principal, etc..) What really stood out to me though was the editing. 21 Jump Street features some of the most awkwardly humorous camera shot transitions, scene changes and music integration. Despite it's faults, I found this to be a damn hard movie to hate, and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun weekend movie.\n\nAll in all... genuine, clever, vulgar yet respectable comedy with some heart. \n\nIMO a very good career move for both Hill and Tatum. \n\nStoked for the sequel.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":533050,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2012-04-25","keywords":"undercover cop,underage drinking,remake,buddy movie,jock","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1681366553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNzI4MDUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE4MDIwNw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNzI4MDUzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjE4MDIwNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A pair of underachieving cops are sent back to a local high school in order to blend in and bring down a synthetic drug ring."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706767/","name":"Jonah Hill"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001084/","name":"Ice Cube"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0520488/","name":"Phil Lord"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588087/","name":"Christopher Miller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0045209/","name":"Michael Bacall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1706767/","name":"Jonah Hill"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367895/","name":"Patrick Hasburgh"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm sure there are many more like this one that would be great for film as an avenue for people to learn about.\n\n SYNOPSIS: During the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, aspiring police officer Richard Jewell (Paul Walter Hauser) is working as security while he stumbles across a bag carrying a bomb. While law enforcement and the media praised him as a "hero" at first, the FBI begins to aggressively investigate the life of Richard Jewell as he becomes their number one suspect.\n\nDIRECTION: Clint Eastwood is great. I love him as a director and as an actor in most things I've seen with him, although I struggle to feel he did something no other Director could do. I'm really glad he chose this this story to put out to the world and whether it's purposeful or not, adding his name to this project will bring this story to more people. I don't want to give him too hard of a time though, because this isn't a film meant to focus around the direction. The story/writing of this film is the focal point and he still did a very good job getting it done. To add one negative I took away, there was a moment where an interview with the real Richard Jewell played on the television as his house and it through me off a bit.\n\nWRITING: The writing in this film was very good. It is based on a true story, so the story itself is largely what captured my attention. However, there are many movies based on or inspired by true stories where the writing couldn't really capture the heart of it and that is where the beauty of the writing lies. It's always hard to know exactly how everything went down and so whether this film is very accurate or mildly accurate, I'm glad they really focused on Richard Jewell and how it affected him and his family and how he was a real trooper through this whole process. There were a couple flaws that I did find with this film. There seemed to be some arc they were going for with Olivia Wilde's character that didn't really come to a close. Then with Tom Shaw (Jon Hamm) and Watson Bryant (Sam Rockwell), although their characters didn't have an arc to really be made with them, both of their parts ended quite abruptly. They were both vital to the story and the film didn't show me nor tell me anything about how either of those two continued after the fact. Well, there was a little info given about something Watson did, but nothing to do with Richard Jewell or his law firm that he had started (not a spoiler, was nothing integral to the story).\n\nACTING: The acting is so good in this film. I can't say it's Hamm's best nor does Wilde really get a chance to fulfill the arc of her character due to the writing, but none-the-less great actors. Then you have Kathy Bates and holy crap does she deserve a Best Supporting nom. All I hear is "of course she's great, she's Kathy Bates)... AND? I'm sorry I didn't know that when you're consistently great that you should be penalized for it or receive any less attention. I get we come to expect it, but then what's the incentive to give your all if you'll just be tossed to the side, because of your positive reputation. That's totally backwards to me. Then Nina Arianda who played Nadya was awesome! She didn't have many scenes, but her back and forth with Sam Rockwell was hilarious and wonderful. Now, lets get to Paul Walter Hauser. Wow. I'm sorry, but this man is neck-and-neck with Adam Driver for me. He has not even been nominated for a Golden Globe or SAG Award? Did they even watch the film? I mean Sam Rockwell was great in this film too, but he's another one of those "yea, but he's too good to nominate. Wouldn't be fare." Paul Walter Hauser shows so much emotion and is SO good at being a man who is holding in his anger, because he respects law enforcement too much. Then in the scenes where he breaks are just tremendous. I will be sorely disappointed if he is not nominated this year.\n\nCONCLUSION: Richard Jewell is a great story about one of American's greatest heroes who probably didn't get enough praise for the job that he did. The story itself and Paul Walter Hauser was enough for me to really enjoy this film, unfortunately there were some flaws with the story with some of the characters and some of the writing. In the end, I would definitely recommend this film for anyone to watch. Richard Jewell is the nicest man I have never met and this is just another story to show that doesn't matter how kind and genuine you are, you'll always have someone try to tear you down.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":77034,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The superbly dramatic theme music, followed immediately by Richard Burton's striking Welsh narration, are utterly entrancing. The rest of the film is not bad, either!\n\nIn January 1879, during the Boer War, at Isandhlwana in South Africa, over one thousand British troops are annihilated by King Cetshwayo's Zulu army. Standing between the four thousand Zulus and victory is the mission station at Rorke's Drift and about one hundred and forty British soldiers, some of whom are wounded. Commanding the military operation is the young Lieutenant John Chard (Stanley Baker, also co-producer of the film) with Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead (Michael Caine, in his first major film role). Against the unimaginable odds, the British troops - the B Company of the 24th Regiment of Foot, South Wales Borderers - manage, with exceptional courage and stoicism, to hold off the Zulu attacks until morning. The valour of the men defending Rourke's Drift resulted in the awarding of eleven Victoria Crosses. The roll of honour is recited by Richard Burton at the film's end.\n\nBaker and Caine are very convincing in the two lead roles as Chard and Bromhead, the rival lieutenants from different social classes who come to respect and even like each other. Their first meeting emphasises the psychological as well as the physical distance between them. Chard, the Engineer Officer, in his shirt-sleeves, is up to his waist in water; Bromhead, the upper-class blue-blood, in his helmet and fine cloak, is on horseback, having just returned from hunting. However, as the battle progresses, this rivalry is forgotten as their prime concern is the job in hand. Their exchange when Chard is injured and Bromhead goes to his aid is telling. By the end of the film, as they stand together in the burnt-out ruins of the hospital, they are equals.\n\nThe incredibly virile Stanley Baker (one wants to say, "Fwhoar!" every time he appears on screen) co-produced the film because, like most Welshmen, he was extremely patriotic and wanted to publicise the bravery of the Welsh soldiers at Rorke's Drift. Michael Caine auditioned originally for the part of Hook but was offered instead the part of Bromhead as his looks were considered more suited to those of an upper-class officer than a Cockney private.\n\nGood support is given by the other actors in the supporting roles. James Booth as Private Henry Hook is probably the most memorable character, portrayed (historically inaccurately) as the company ne'er-do-well, yet who wakes up to his duty at the moment of crisis and fights almost to the death. Jack Hawkins and Ulla Jacobssen are effective as the well-meaning but naive father-and-daughter missionaries, the Witts. The outstanding bravery and selflessness of the other (mainly) Welsh soldiers is brought out by all the actors in the subordinate roles. \n\nWhat I think is very admirable about 'Zulu' is its lack of jingoism. Far from it crowing about British supremacy over the natives, it portrays the bravery of the Zulus as equal to or even greater than that of the British. At the end of the battle, there is no great rejoicing; it was just a job which had to be done because they were there. In the ruins of the hospital, when Chard asks Bromhead how he feels, Bromhead replies, "Sick." Their dialogue continues: \n\nBromhead: There's something else. I feel ashamed. Was that how it was for you? The first time?\n\nChard: First time? Do you think I could stand this butcher's yard more than once?\n\nBromhead: I didn't know. \n\nChard: I told you. I came up here to build a bridge.\n\nNo more needs to be said.\n\nAlthough the character names and events are factual, the film does sometimes sacrifice historical accuracy for dramatic effect. How much real rivalry there was between Chard and Bromhead is unclear - although it is true that Bromhead ceded command to Chard. Private Hook was not the thief and ne'er-do-well as played by James Booth. Colour Sergeant Bourne was a short man and quite unlike Nigel Green in appearance. Most of the Victoria Cross winners were English, not Welsh. And the film itself was shot not at Rorke's Drift but at a location some miles away.\n\nInterestingly, neither Chard nor Bromhead lived to a great age. Both died in their forties, Chard of mouth cancer in 1897 and Bromhead of fever on active service a few years before. Neither ever married. Nevertheless, their names are immortalised in 'Zulu' - as are the deeds of the tremendously brave men, Welsh, English and Zulu, at Rorke's Drift on 22nd/23rd January 1879.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37944,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1964-06-10","keywords":"hopelessly outnumbered,zulu,british army,military tactics,anglo zulu war","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1889321753","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Outnumbered British soldiers do battle with Zulu warriors at Rorke's Drift."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048939/","name":"Stanley Baker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370144/","name":"Jack Hawkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414965/","name":"Ulla Jacobsson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103340/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695667/","name":"John Prebble"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"}],"duration":"PT2H18M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nevertheless, their names are immortalised in 'Zulu' - as are the deeds of the tremendously brave men, Welsh, English and Zulu, at Rorke's Drift on 22nd/23rd January 1879.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37944,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1964-06-10","keywords":"hopelessly outnumbered,zulu,british army,military tactics,anglo zulu war","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1889321753","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTk3MTRjYmEtMGRhYy00NmUxLWFhOWQtNDgwYzNmNTZmMjJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Outnumbered British soldiers do battle with Zulu warriors at Rorke's Drift.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048939/","name":"Stanley Baker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0370144/","name":"Jack Hawkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0414965/","name":"Ulla Jacobsson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103340/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695667/","name":"John Prebble","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0256831/","name":"Cy Endfield"],"duration":"PT2H18M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.\n\nIt's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).\n\nThe Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.\n\nIn a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.\n\nBridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice ("Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.\n\nTwo little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling.

It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.\n\nIt's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).\n\nThe Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.\n\nIn a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.\n\nBridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice ("Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.\n\nTwo little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.\n\nAside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":300792,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"lawyer,negotiation,cold war,spy,berlin wall","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Standing Man" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi303870745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4131020/","name":"Matt Charman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"],"duration":"PT2H22M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The Russian descendant midwife Anna Khitrova (Naomi Watts) finds Tatiana's diary written in Russian language in her belongings and decided to find her family to deliver the baby, she brings the diary home and ask her uncle Stepan (Jerzy Skolimowski) to translate the document. Stepan refuses, but Anna finds a card of a restaurant owned by the Russian Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) inside the diary and she visits the old man trying to find a lead to contact Tatiana's family. When she mentions the existence of the diary, Semyon immediately offers to translate the document. However, Stepan translates part of the diary and Anna discovers that Semyon and his sick son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) had raped Tatiana when she was fourteen years old and forced her to work as prostitute in a brothel of their own. Further, Semyon is the dangerous boss of the Russian mafia "Vory v Zakone", jeopardizing the safety of Anna and her family. Meanwhile, Semyon's driver Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen) gets close to Kirill and Semyon, climbing positions in the criminal organization, but he helps Anna, her family and the baby.\n\nAfter "A History of Violence", David Cronenberg makes another engaging an d violent thriller with the excellent actor Viggo Mortensen. His character recalls the one he performed in the magnificent "American Yakuza" in the beginning of his successful career. After the Italian mobsters, Latin drug dealers and Yakuza, it seems that Russian Mafia and human trafficking are the present mobster organization and business explored by the cinema industry. In addition to the great direction of Cronenberg, the performances of Vincent Cassell and Armin Mueller-Stahl are top-notch and Naomi Watts is efficient as usual. In the end, "Eatern Promises" is a great entertainment. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Senhores do Crime" ("Lords of the Crime")","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235687,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-04-02","keywords":"sex scene,pubic hair,nudity,ukrainian,brutality","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eastern Promises","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2947612953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyNjMzMDMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQxNDYy._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyNjMzMDMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQxNDYy._V1_.jpg","description":"Eastern Promises - Trailer #2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000090/","name":"Armin Mueller-Stahl"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000343/","name":"David Cronenberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0110977/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0016814/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140275/","name":"Steven Knight"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Stepan refuses, but Anna finds a card of a restaurant owned by the Russian Semyon (Armin Mueller-Stahl) inside the diary and she visits the old man trying to find a lead to contact Tatiana's family. When she mentions the existence of the diary, Semyon immediately offers to translate the document. However, Stepan translates part of the diary and Anna discovers that Semyon and his sick son Kirill (Vincent Cassel) had raped Tatiana when she was fourteen years old and forced her to work as prostitute in a brothel of their own. Further, Semyon is the dangerous boss of the Russian mafia "Vory v Zakone", jeopardizing the safety of Anna and her family. Meanwhile, Semyon's driver Nikolai Luzhin (Viggo Mortensen) gets close to Kirill and Semyon, climbing positions in the criminal organization, but he helps Anna, her family and the baby.\n\nAfter "A History of Violence", David Cronenberg makes another engaging an d violent thriller with the excellent actor Viggo Mortensen. His character recalls the one he performed in the magnificent "American Yakuza" in the beginning of his successful career. After the Italian mobsters, Latin drug dealers and Yakuza, it seems that Russian Mafia and human trafficking are the present mobster organization and business explored by the cinema industry. In addition to the great direction of Cronenberg, the performances of Vincent Cassell and Armin Mueller-Stahl are top-notch and Naomi Watts is efficient as usual. In the end, "Eatern Promises" is a great entertainment. My vote is eight.\n\nTitle (Brazil): "Senhores do Crime" ("Lords of the Crime")","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235687,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-04-02","keywords":"sex scene,pubic hair,nudity,ukrainian,brutality","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eastern Promises","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2947612953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyNjMzMDMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQxNDYy._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyNjMzMDMwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDQxNDYy._V1_.jpg","description":"Eastern Promises - Trailer #2","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001557/","name":"Viggo Mortensen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000090/","name":"Armin Mueller-Stahl"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000343/","name":"David Cronenberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0110977/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0016814/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140275/","name":"Steven Knight"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

As both women explore elements of time lost and regrets, they open up for a new chance while awakening their sexuality.

I wasn't sure how he would do with a non-Western setting but he managed well.\n\nHe keeps his unique style and it works very well with the futuristic, but still traditional Japanese art. It also incorporates some cartooning along with interesting ideas - the Japanese dialogue is not always translated and when it is, it's by interpreters or foreign exchange students. Anderson manages to merge his style with the Japanese and it works seamlessly.\n\nIt's a very quirky film with an all too relatable story.

It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.\n\nIt's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).\n\nThe Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.\n\nIn a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.\n\nBridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice ("Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.\n\nTwo little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.\n\nAside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":300792,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"lawyer,negotiation,cold war,spy,berlin wall","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Standing Man" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi303870745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4131020/","name":"Matt Charman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"duration":"PT2H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The result is a series of powerful rushes and abrupt stops. A pacing that, perhaps, is a bit too self conscious for its own good doesn't help us to connect the emotional dots. I had the feeling I had lost something in the love story of the protagonists - something that didn't happen to me reading the book.

The beauty of the images is overwhelming and the assuredness of Joe Wright at his second feature after the, much better, "Pride and Prejudice" keeps you going.

The new millennium has given birth to two of the greatest franchise ( Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) that cinema has seen since the original Star Wars.Its very rare to witness not only one film masterpiece, but two is just extraordinary. The Harry Potter films contain the best story telling, action, human connection to the audience and bring out the most emotion of the characters I have ever seen in a franchise. Its amazing to see the transition that the Harry Potter films have taken from innocence kid friendly movies, to when our generation matured, so did the films. They became more dark and more developed with intensity of story and character building. This film is fulfilling, sad and satisfying. The factor that has kept these movies looking amazing is the cinematography and effect that have stayed constant through the film through the years. The film has those two elements and more working for it which makes it the best film in the Potter franchise. This franchise has kept it's flame burning strong for 10 years and director David Yates sends this Wizard series away in the best fashion it could achieve. This movie has to be the best out of the 8 films and combined everything that someone would be looking for in a Harry Potter film and also displays everything that fans of the series have been looking for and that the amount of action.I thought that Transformers Dark of the Moon delivered the most action of the summer and I was wrong. Harry Potter gives the audience the most action that a film can contain combined with the highest level of emotion I have ever seen.Deathly Hollows Part 2 contains the most heart, pure emotion and extreme action I have ever seen in cinema since the original Star Wars. The pacing of this film does not let the audience catch their breath when witnessing this masterpiece. Their is so much to see and so much to take in that if you blink you will miss out something great. This movie delivers everything that someone from critics and fans would be looking for in a close out film. All credit in my opinion goes to the director, David Yates, for bringing this kid friendly movie up to speed with the maturity level that the books brought over the course of their time. Yates and all director of the franchise did the best job transforming the JK Rowling book series into box office hits that has been accepted warmly by fans and critic. But by far David Yates has done the best job of pulling emotions out of his cast, making them relateable to the audience and creating a certain tone for the viewer to witness and grasps the gravity that is going on in the closing journey of Harry Potter. He has done the best job of well rounding his movies that they are not only entertaining, but also makes the audience yearn for more Harry Potter films. I also give a lot of credit to the main cast members from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Ralph Fiennes. They all have done a great job of shaping the memories of the famous novel character into visual ones that have made an imprint into the viewers mind and they have done the best jobs that young to old actors can do with this sort of property. They are all equally nice to watch and bring so much passion to the film that the audience cant help, but notice dedication to the movies.It's not only the main characters that show the greatest acting and hear, but also the secondary actors bring a lot to the film and all pleasant to watching. This movie franchise is made it's mark in the world of cinema as one of the greatest series that have ever been viewed and this film wraps the franchise up in the best way possible.

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...\n\nAt other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.\n\nApart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.\n\nAnd, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.\n\nChow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.\n\nThe center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the "Luke Skywalker" of the piece, if you will...though "Crouching Tiger..." has everything the "Star Wars" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.\n\nBy the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the "Full Peckinpaw," if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.\n\nThere are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!\n\nI won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.\n\nMy recommendation: Just go see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.

We then go back in time to 1979, as these ladies retell how they met and fell heads over heels for each other and very soon moved in together. Through two sperm donors, each of them has a baby girl. The sperm donors agree to waive all rights (and obligations)... At this point we are 10 min into the opening episode.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest film from Ry Russo-Young ("Before I Fall", "The Sun Is Also a Star"). Here she examines her own life and background, being raised by two moms in the early 80s when that was anything but normal/accepted, even in New York. Both sperm donors are in California, and gave up all parenting and visitation rights, but as luck would have it, they are both on great terms with Russo and Young, and in particular Tom (biological father of Ry) develops strong a strong bond with Ry. What could possibly go wrong? This in turn leads to the question: who/what constitutes a family? Obviously the film maker has unfettered access to her moms, and the series (or at least Episode 1) plays out mostly from that perspective. I can't wait to see the remaining two episodes.\n\n"Nuclear family" premiered last Sunday on HBO and Episode 1 is now available on HBO on Demand, HBO Max and other streaming platforms.

The Wolf Pack are back and this time a gangster (John Goodman) are after them because Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) stole forty-two million in gold. I'm really not going to waste anytime writing out everything going on here in regards to a plot synapses because why should I? It's clear that director and writer Todd Phillips along with stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis just made this thing either for the money or they had some sort of contract that required them to do so. While watching this thing it became rather sad because there simply weren't any laughs but what was worse is that it didn't seem the group were trying to make anything funny. This here is without question one of the laziest comedies I've ever seen because the filmmakers don't even bother to even attempt any laughs and what laughs there are are usually just winks to the first picture. It's really amazing to see how this series has fallen after a clever first film but the old saying that sequels usually end up poorly is certainly true. Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis fit their roles just fine but there's just no energy to be found here. Perhaps even they knew the screenplay was lackluster. Jeong is good in small doses but putting him into so much of this just made his character annoying. Goodman was good in his part but sadly he wasn't given much to do, which is the same for Mike Epps and Heather Graham. THE HANGOVER PART III claims to be the final in an epic series of films and lets pray that it really is. Bad movies happen sometimes even when everyone had their hearts into the project. There's just no evidence here that anyone cared about anything other than money. Part two proved that people would show up no matter how bad it was and the filmmakers got even lazier by delivering something worse."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":304226,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-05-29","keywords":"heart attack,giraffe,breast implant,prostitute,karaoke bar","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2312742425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This time, there's no wedding.

The Wolf Pack are back and this time a gangster (John Goodman) are after them because Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) stole forty-two million in gold. I'm really not going to waste anytime writing out everything going on here in regards to a plot synapses because why should I? It's clear that director and writer Todd Phillips along with stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms and Zach Galifianakis just made this thing either for the money or they had some sort of contract that required them to do so. While watching this thing it became rather sad because there simply weren't any laughs but what was worse is that it didn't seem the group were trying to make anything funny. This here is without question one of the laziest comedies I've ever seen because the filmmakers don't even bother to even attempt any laughs and what laughs there are are usually just winks to the first picture. It's really amazing to see how this series has fallen after a clever first film but the old saying that sequels usually end up poorly is certainly true. Cooper, Helms and Galifianakis fit their roles just fine but there's just no energy to be found here. Perhaps even they knew the screenplay was lackluster. Jeong is good in small doses but putting him into so much of this just made his character annoying. Goodman was good in his part but sadly he wasn't given much to do, which is the same for Mike Epps and Heather Graham. THE HANGOVER PART III claims to be the final in an epic series of films and lets pray that it really is. Bad movies happen sometimes even when everyone had their hearts into the project. There's just no evidence here that anyone cared about anything other than money. Part two proved that people would show up no matter how bad it was and the filmmakers got even lazier by delivering something worse.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":304226,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2013-05-29","keywords":"heart attack,giraffe,breast implant,prostitute,karaoke bar","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Version 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2312742425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM3MjI4OTk1N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjMyNDczOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This time, there's no wedding.

"Percy Vs Goliath") is a biographical drama film based on the life of Canadian farmer Percy Schmeiser. Directed by Clark Johnson ("S. W. A. T.", "The Sentinel") and starring Christopher Walken, Christina Ricci, and Zach Braff, it is a relatively routine true story picture that benefits primarily from its main star holding things together.\n\nIn 1998, in the Canadian town of Bruno, Saskatchewan, elderly farmer Percy Schmeiser (Christopher Walken) one day discovers he is being sued by the Monsanto corporation for allegedly using their enhanced GMO seeds for several years. Due to his family's limited funds, Percy cannot afford to take them on by himself and so enlists the help of young hotshot lawyer Jackson Weaver (Zach Braff) and environmental activist Rebecca Salcau (Christina Ricci) to fight a legal battle to ensure the safety of crops belonging to farmers everywhere. Because of the constant media exposure, Percy and his team gain many supporters from all over the world who motivate them to keep going in their pursuit of justice over the domineering corporate businesses.\n\nSince moving to a more rural neighbourhood many years ago, I have come to appreciate how hard farmers work to provide consumers with the best quality product they are capable of growing. Naturally, there will be various things that prove problematic along the way, such as the pressure to use GMOs or unsafe pesticides in their fruits and vegetables. In the film "Percy", we see that these factors are more serious than we may have originally thought, causing us to question the legality of corporate interference in selling harvested crops to unknowing customers. Although the film initially presents this as a locally Canadian issue, it is later established that there are corporations in other countries guilty of doing this as well. One scene in particular shows that farmers in India are suffering at the hands of big businesses bullying them into submission, which has contributed to high suicide rates among workers in that profession. It made me wonder how badly farmers have it in my own area as more than twenty years later, the issue of GMOs and pesticides are still a prevalent issue today.\n\nThere's little to say in terms of the directorial style here. Clark Johnson keeps things going at a simplistic level, intercutting between moments of Percy and co discussing legal matters with generic shots of the Saskatchewan farmland. Granted, it would be rather difficult to make subject matter like GMO seeds interesting to most audiences but for the most part he succeeds, showing that the future of a farmer's livelihood is at stake here. While I am aware this film is based on true events, I still wish it was less pedestrian in its approach to the source material. Everything felt as though it was following a typical template set by much better biographical dramas before it. As a result, I often found myself drifting in and out of my investment in the story, as I could tell right away how things were going to end due to the predictable direction that it was heading. Despite that, I was at least still curious to see how other farmers would react to the final court ruling of what Percy and his group ended up with.\n\nIt's easy to take for granted an actor like Christopher Walken, due to how prolific he is and the large amount of bizarre performances he's given in the past. Here, however, Walken demonstrates a dramatic range we often forget he's capable of, bringing a relatable sincerity to the role of Percy Schmeiser, a humble Canadian farmer who only wants what's best for the produce he grows (in this case, canola), bringing a necessary emotional centre to the film. I'm not sure how accurate his accent was, as American and Canadian accents sound almost identical to me, but I did feel he did a decent enough job convincing me that he was from North of the border. It was also nice to see Christina Ricci in a supporting role, as I consider her to be highly underrated. Ricci is one of those actresses whom I've never seen give a bad performance in anything she's in, and this film is no exception. I liked how her character remained a loyal ally to Percy, even accompanying him on international ventures to promote his cause. Zach Braff, on the other hand, wasn't featured as often as he should have been. This is a shame as I enjoyed seeing his character standing up for Percy and farmers everywhere based on his own moral principles rather than for monetary reasons. He is only prominently seen during the first and final acts of the film, which leads me to believe he was likely written in as a mere afterthought.\n\nWhile the film is nothing groundbreaking, it's still a decent enough drama to hold one's attention for its short duration of 99 minutes. It proudly wears its anti-capitalist morals on its sleeve so anyone who likes movies that try to "stick it to the man" should derive enough entertainment from something like this. As for me, I liked the acting the most, mainly from Walken and Ricci, so I hope those two will work together on something else in the future.\n\nI rate it 6.5/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1537,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-04-30","keywords":"farmer,organic farmer,cross contamination,lawsuit,courtroom","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Percy Vs Goliath Official US Trailer (2021)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi260423705","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlZTEwZGUtNmZjYi00MjkwLThjYTMtNWU4NDg0MDk2MDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlZTEwZGUtNmZjYi00MjkwLThjYTMtNWU4NDg0MDk2MDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000686/","name":"Christopher Walken"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0561809/","name":"Roberta Maxwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000207/","name":"Christina Ricci"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424800/","name":"Clark Johnson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293963/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0705676/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0141447/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2125366/","name":"Garfield Lindsay Miller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0429499/","name":"Hilary Pryor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1285700/","name":"Maureen Dorey"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt2080374/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"AlsExGal"},"dateCreated":"2017-07-08","inLanguage":"English","name":"an abstract portrait of the man..","reviewBody":"... in that you can argue about almost every stroke in the painting, yet when you stand back a few feet from the work, you realize that this is a more accurate portrayal of Steve Jobs than any photograph could be.\n\nFor example, Michael Fassbender looks nothing like Steve Jobs did at any point in his adult life, sounds nothing like Steve Jobs did. Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years.

Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to paint a portrait of the man at its epicenter. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt2080374/","name":"Steve Jobs","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NTA2MTEwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg4NzU2NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to paint a portrait of the man at its epicenter.

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film.

With a plot that's tailor-made for a romantic comedy (it has got a lot to do with Lucy's heartbreaks and the souvenirs she keeps from those broken relationships), The Broken Hearts Gallery makes the city of New York look like a standout character.

I didn't expect many surprises in the screenplay (which occasionally descends into downright cheesiness) but what bothered me was the distinct lack of humor. Here and there, we get a chuckle or two, courtesy of the largely silent Jeff (Nathan Dales), Eva Woolf (a spirited Bernadette Peters), and Marcos (Arturo Castro). The Broken Hearts Gallery wholly rides on Geraldine's star-making role and the chemistry she shares with Dacre (which was fine in parts, yes!).\n\nWhile the inclusion of multi-ethnic (there's Utkarsh Ambudkar playing Max Vora, presumably of Indian origin) and LGBTQ (Philippa Soo plays Nadine, a lesbian) characters is commendable, they often recede conveniently into the background for the central plot to play out. It's not a bad film by any measure (Alar Kivilo's cinematography is a plus); The Broken Hearts Gallery, written and directed by Natalie Krinsky, is certainly one for audiences who savor their romantic comedies with a tolerable dose of clichés and syrupy feels.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6467,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-09-11","keywords":"art curator,new york city,breakup,art gallery,boyfriend girlfriend relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3418013977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTBiNjY3YWUtNmM1MS00OTUxLTk1ZmItZjI4MjRlNzE5ZThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTBiNjY3YWUtNmM1MS00OTUxLTk1ZmItZjI4MjRlNzE5ZThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"After a break up, a young woman decides to start a gallery where people can leave trinkets from past relationships."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6543093/","name":"Geraldine Viswanathan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4223882/","name":"Dacre Montgomery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2064295/","name":"Utkarsh Ambudkar"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3706989/","name":"Natalie Krinsky"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276952/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3706989/","name":"Natalie Krinsky"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's not a bad film by any measure (Alar Kivilo's cinematography is a plus); The Broken Hearts Gallery, written and directed by Natalie Krinsky, is certainly one for audiences who savor their romantic comedies with a tolerable dose of clichés and syrupy feels.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6467,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-09-11","keywords":"art curator,new york city,breakup,art gallery,boyfriend girlfriend relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3418013977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTBiNjY3YWUtNmM1MS00OTUxLTk1ZmItZjI4MjRlNzE5ZThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTBiNjY3YWUtNmM1MS00OTUxLTk1ZmItZjI4MjRlNzE5ZThkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"After a break up, a young woman decides to start a gallery where people can leave trinkets from past relationships.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6543093/","name":"Geraldine Viswanathan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4223882/","name":"Dacre Montgomery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2064295/","name":"Utkarsh Ambudkar"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3706989/","name":"Natalie Krinsky"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276952/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3706989/","name":"Natalie Krinsky"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

It always had the ingredients for a fascinating study of human behaviour. Its conductor Dr. Philip Zimbardo knew that, it just had to be played out. Of course, The Stanford Prison Experiment is a story that's been notably portrayed before, such as the 2001 German film Das Experiment. I remember being a fan of it when I first saw it, but I admit I can't quite recall it enough to make a comparison here. Nevertheless, this American version which doesn't make substitutions is a preferable version, one that makes resourceful use of today's technology and young talent. There's a dual study going on here. One, the part that writes itself, a document of the actual experiment. And the other, an examination of the ethics of the experimenters. Here is the ugly side of the human condition and our desires to push one another to feel the sweet taste of superiority.\n\nWhile it may lend the obvious yet compelling results of what imaginary power and authority does to people, it still needs to be well executed to work. Fortunately director Kyle Patrick Alvarez and writer Tim Talbott have the right handling of the material, working with great economy in balancing its dichotomy's. At first it's disarmingly casual in the way the volunteers are selected and summoned, making a point of its randomizations and often offering an endearing and natural sense of humour. While superficially bleak, it's having fun with the 70s clothes and oversized moustaches, without peeling back their integrity. But then real tension, real anguish, and a real sensation of danger and dread creeps in and The Stanford Prison Experiment becomes deeply unsettling in its dehumanization techniques. With a careful sense from Alvarez of how far to escalate each sequence, it rings true to human sensibilities of what would happen in this unique situation. There's always a reminder that it isn't real, but it doesn't stop you from feeling unbearably trapped. This is nature at work, combined with a touch of modern cruelty.\n\nThere is a tendency in the film's inherent and forgivably episodic narrative that it gets you attached to a character they're focusing on only due to their upcoming exit. Thereby the film loses steam bit by bit. It gradually wins you back afterwards, but each time it takes a little longer. Ezra Miller in particular is a highlight of the first half of the film, formulating some of the most memorable instances of the prisoner's rebellions and reluctances. He's missed, but his absence only breeds more tension and vulnerability as we're left with weaker willed volunteers. If anything, this film is an impressive display of the best talent from the next generation of actors. Hopefully all to soon be familiar faces; Johnny Simmons, Tye Sheridan, Brett Davern, and a guard with the most inventive choice of wording, Michael Angarano, all stick out among other strong performances. While a crowded ensemble does mean no character gets to be fleshed out to their full potential, Alvarez and Talbott at least give room for everyone a time to shine without any dim spots.\n\nOn the experimenters end, Billy Crudup is perfect casting as Dr. Zimbardo. Donning a beard that gives him an uncanny resemblance to Satan, it doesn't remove that trustworthy glint of compassion in his eyes. His usual warmth is countered by his malicious intent to shove the volunteers to their limits and it creates an enthralling inner conflict where he's finding his own limits. The film admittedly does lack a female presence giving the nature of 24 volunteers and all the scientists being men. Its only example is Olivia Thirlby as Zimbardo's girlfriend who later involves herself in the experiment and becomes a voice of reason, but a very welcome one. It may have blind spots and a few stumbles, but it doesn't hinder what the film does right. As I was completely wrapped in its deft and dense confrontations, I kept waiting for the film to explode. Perhaps recalling the more gritty approach Das Experiment took to its second half, instead this implodes, which is a much more restrained and satisfying conclusion to watch these invisible social constructs dissolve rather than erupt.\n\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment's wealth of strong material and performances are matched by its technical ambitions. The slick photography makes it cinematic with liberal collages of close-ups and swift camera moves but still keeping it intimate. When the scene calls for rigid obedience, any time the camera moves out of line we hold our breath. It's graded with a washed-out atmosphere, relishing in the moody darkness. I've been irritated with indie films that abuse a shallow depth of field in their photography for no good reason, but this film uses it to isolate you in its grasp and as a result the film shook me up for the rest of the day. While it gets under the skin of the prisoners and the scientists, I did find myself wanting to get behind the motivations of the guards, the most vocal contributors of the experiment. Instead, thats saved for an epilogue that feels like a wise afterthought, but it's a powerful note on the personal experiments we run just because the opportunity is there. The Stanford Prison Experiment is an ideal taut psychological thriller that bristles with youthful energy and will mostly likely remain standing as one of the best of the year.\n\n8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41130,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-07-17","keywords":"prisoner,guard,prison,psychology,university","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi739618841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU4MDQwNDc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMzg5NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU4MDQwNDc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMzg5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It is the summer of 1971.

It always had the ingredients for a fascinating study of human behaviour. Its conductor Dr. Philip Zimbardo knew that, it just had to be played out. Of course, The Stanford Prison Experiment is a story that's been notably portrayed before, such as the 2001 German film Das Experiment. I remember being a fan of it when I first saw it, but I admit I can't quite recall it enough to make a comparison here. Nevertheless, this American version which doesn't make substitutions is a preferable version, one that makes resourceful use of today's technology and young talent. There's a dual study going on here. One, the part that writes itself, a document of the actual experiment. And the other, an examination of the ethics of the experimenters. Here is the ugly side of the human condition and our desires to push one another to feel the sweet taste of superiority.\n\nWhile it may lend the obvious yet compelling results of what imaginary power and authority does to people, it still needs to be well executed to work. Fortunately director Kyle Patrick Alvarez and writer Tim Talbott have the right handling of the material, working with great economy in balancing its dichotomy's. At first it's disarmingly casual in the way the volunteers are selected and summoned, making a point of its randomizations and often offering an endearing and natural sense of humour. While superficially bleak, it's having fun with the 70s clothes and oversized moustaches, without peeling back their integrity. But then real tension, real anguish, and a real sensation of danger and dread creeps in and The Stanford Prison Experiment becomes deeply unsettling in its dehumanization techniques. With a careful sense from Alvarez of how far to escalate each sequence, it rings true to human sensibilities of what would happen in this unique situation. There's always a reminder that it isn't real, but it doesn't stop you from feeling unbearably trapped. This is nature at work, combined with a touch of modern cruelty.\n\nThere is a tendency in the film's inherent and forgivably episodic narrative that it gets you attached to a character they're focusing on only due to their upcoming exit. Thereby the film loses steam bit by bit. It gradually wins you back afterwards, but each time it takes a little longer. Ezra Miller in particular is a highlight of the first half of the film, formulating some of the most memorable instances of the prisoner's rebellions and reluctances. He's missed, but his absence only breeds more tension and vulnerability as we're left with weaker willed volunteers. If anything, this film is an impressive display of the best talent from the next generation of actors. Hopefully all to soon be familiar faces; Johnny Simmons, Tye Sheridan, Brett Davern, and a guard with the most inventive choice of wording, Michael Angarano, all stick out among other strong performances. While a crowded ensemble does mean no character gets to be fleshed out to their full potential, Alvarez and Talbott at least give room for everyone a time to shine without any dim spots.\n\nOn the experimenters end, Billy Crudup is perfect casting as Dr. Zimbardo. Donning a beard that gives him an uncanny resemblance to Satan, it doesn't remove that trustworthy glint of compassion in his eyes. His usual warmth is countered by his malicious intent to shove the volunteers to their limits and it creates an enthralling inner conflict where he's finding his own limits. The film admittedly does lack a female presence giving the nature of 24 volunteers and all the scientists being men. Its only example is Olivia Thirlby as Zimbardo's girlfriend who later involves herself in the experiment and becomes a voice of reason, but a very welcome one. It may have blind spots and a few stumbles, but it doesn't hinder what the film does right. As I was completely wrapped in its deft and dense confrontations, I kept waiting for the film to explode. Perhaps recalling the more gritty approach Das Experiment took to its second half, instead this implodes, which is a much more restrained and satisfying conclusion to watch these invisible social constructs dissolve rather than erupt.\n\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment's wealth of strong material and performances are matched by its technical ambitions. The slick photography makes it cinematic with liberal collages of close-ups and swift camera moves but still keeping it intimate. When the scene calls for rigid obedience, any time the camera moves out of line we hold our breath. It's graded with a washed-out atmosphere, relishing in the moody darkness. I've been irritated with indie films that abuse a shallow depth of field in their photography for no good reason, but this film uses it to isolate you in its grasp and as a result the film shook me up for the rest of the day. While it gets under the skin of the prisoners and the scientists, I did find myself wanting to get behind the motivations of the guards, the most vocal contributors of the experiment. Instead, thats saved for an epilogue that feels like a wise afterthought, but it's a powerful note on the personal experiments we run just because the opportunity is there. The Stanford Prison Experiment is an ideal taut psychological thriller that bristles with youthful energy and will mostly likely remain standing as one of the best of the year.\n\n8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41130,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-07-17","keywords":"prisoner,guard,prison,psychology,university","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi739618841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU4MDQwNDc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMzg5NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU4MDQwNDc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMzg5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It is the summer of 1971.

This is a bizarre film, unnecessarily complicated, that assembles a top-notch cast, puts them into a tense situation with all the players in place, and then has nothing to do with them. It's like the writer forgot that you needed a third act; it's all rising action with no denouement.\n\nWashington plays Det. Frazier, a hostage negotiator who acts, literally, as if this is his first case. He has the obligatory younger partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor, "Serenity") who exists so Frazier can explain his theories and the obligatory ESU commander who wants to go in and shoot everyone (Willem Dafoe, sadly underused). Owen plays the bank robber, about whom frustratingly nothing is known except what he said into the camera in the trailer. Finally, Foster plays some sort of player amongst the Powers That Be who walks into the mayor's office, demands an update, and is given "every possible courtesy", etc. She serves no purpose whatsoever, not even in a clichéd action movie type of way like Dafoe and Ejiofor. The performances are the only good part of the movie, but there are times when you can tell that the actors wished they were in a better film. They're giving it their all, and they're getting no help from anyone else involved.\n\nSpike Lee is up to his usual tricks here, which, in this type of movie, is a very bad thing. The details of the heist itself I won't disclose. I can't. The action is, at best, vague - extremely brief scenes of vaults opening, hole-digging, hostage roughing up, and the usual bank-robber stuff are all the details we really get. It is also inter cut with scenes of the hostages recalling the heist; their recollections serve no purpose except to confuse the audience further. "Inside Man" is curiously racist: the white crooks rough up the black bank customers, the white Foster and the mayor order around Washington, the white cops mistake a Sikh for an Arab and beat him, and even a Jewish hostage was not only a lawyer, but has a nephew who is a jeweler. Washington and Ejiofor are given no flaws whatsoever and are seen mostly being pushed around by everyone else in the movie. The action repeatedly grinds to a halt so Lee can insert quirky little subplots involving video games, Washington's much younger girlfriend and random Albanian women. They're at best unnecessary, at worst, disastrous. If we had been given a director with more focus, there is the feeling that this could have been a lean, mean thriller. But it drags and drags and drags and when we get to the end, we understand why the film stalled for so long: the ending is about as climatic as erectile dysfunction.\n\n"Inside Man" looked like it had it all - great cast, good concept, reputable director, but the end result is a near-disaster. It's like someone threw "Dog Day Afternoon" into a blender, drank it, and vomited it back onto the screen. As I stumbled out of the theater, deprived of my money and time, I cursed the screen gods who thought to tease me with such an improbably bad movie. I thought back to a better day, when a movie at least knew what was going on even if the audience didn't, gave us characters who seemed like actual people and served actual purposes to the plot, so that even if we had to wait until the Big Twist to answer our questions, we at least had a reason to still care."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture.\n\nNow after Shazam!, Aquaman &amp; the masterpiece Joker, DC presents us with Birds of Prey, the fourth entry movie that proves that their tables have pretty much turned around by finding suitable directors for their movies and that they are catching up to compete with the Marvel Universe. No feud here please.\n\nHere's my thoughts on Birds of Prey:\n\nThe movie features slick action scenes which complete with very acrobatic-like choreography that constantly pleases the eyes of everyone who are looking forward for femme fatales kicking ass. There are plenty of them to keep you amazed.\n\nBirds of Prey also delivers a vigorous energy throughout, it feels like you are high on drugs. The close-ups feel very intimate yet feel very caricature in a positive way. The quality of cameras &amp; the colour palette capture a reality of life, giving a sense of how rough it actually is, very dark and gritty but... also sometimes sprinkles the dour tone with graciously boisterous and delicate tinted colours. The occasional slo-mo ampes up the already intense energy.\n\nSome of you might have asked regarding the feminist movement. Birds of Prey is a done right feminist film. A key successful factor to driving a feminist film is to create an innate story on women without being pushy on the political agenda. Birds of Prey does that. Another thing is this is not a guy-turn-girl remakes (Yes, I'm watching you Ghostbusters &amp; Ocean's 8). And BOP does not or rarely knocks down the men genes as weak or indecisive. Kudos Birds of Prey!\n\nNow, let's talk about Margot Robbie &amp; Mary Elizabeth Winstead. These two really go beyond the next level to dive into their character as uniquely as possible. Margot Robbie as always should be receiving a standing ovation as Harley Quinn again, after the meh Suicide Squad. She restrains from letting anyone steals her spotlight. If her and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker are caught together in a love story, it will be the best romance movie of the decade. The complexity and different types of deranged personalities they uphold. Wow! Winstead as Huntress is the runner up here, she gives out a hot breeze of aura that it is hard to back away from. Her charismatic sexual energy captures the attention like a bullseye . Bell as Black Canary is cool, but not as great as the other two. Bella as Cain shows to be mischievous but her character only pretty much follows where the major characters take her.\n\nIt also offers decent humour overall. Harley Quinn is consciously great in this, her facial movements contribute a lot! Some are fresh from the oven, others are a bit obsolete but those humours though feel old keep us glued to the screen.\n\nFinal battle, the best thing is the lack of unrealistic weaponry that they occupy which makes it all feels so real. It is entertaining and fun too as there are certain scenes that feature a low amount of quick cuts.\n\nNow, the most detectable problem with this movie is it spends so much time on character development of the all-girls group that it forgets that they can excite the audience with the combo pack. An hour later and they are still focusing on so many character devs!\n\nBecause of this, the relationship between members of Birds of Prey is very shadowy and leaves an unsatisfied feeling by the end. Like somehow they have been forced exponentially to know and work with one another.\n\nSo many developments but they forget Roman's character, the main antagonist which feels quite underdeveloped. When a scene of him pops up especially after 40% of the film, it really wants to tell something meaningful about him, but eventually moves on with it, providing us with a lack of knowledge of what his wholesome embodies.\n\nHyena &amp; police cop. With a lack of screen time, we do not really see Hyena attacking people at all which some of you might have anticipated. Renee as the cop is one that is really bad at acting, it needs fixing. It is like watching a brick talks with try-hard emotions.\n\nWhile this centres on supervillains, Birds of Prey fails on the costume design. Not a single character clothes himself/herself as a good superhero model portrayal of a costume. It feels very lazy thus, this however tones down the great energy the movie has possessed. It is so bad that varsity students can design them better.\n\nVerdict: Imaginative &amp; darkly flamboyant, Birds of Prey proves that the comeback of DC is possible, adapting many characters into the big screen as a beacon of call to level itself with the colossal Marvel.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-02-07","keywords":"harley quinn character,police,hyena,spin off,chase","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Birds of Prey Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3883843353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMDNjMDQtNjk2ZS00ZGY4LTgzODMtOTAzOTM4MmJhOTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMDNjMDQtNjk2ZS00ZGY4LTgzODMtOTAzOTM4MmJhOTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001609/","name":"Rosie Perez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935541/","name":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4014166/","name":"Cathy Yan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0637285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0693170/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5429637/","name":"Christina Hodson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0227704/","name":"Paul Dini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0863622/","name":"Bruce Timm"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Like somehow they have been forced exponentially to know and work with one another.\n\nSo many developments but they forget Roman's character, the main antagonist which feels quite underdeveloped. When a scene of him pops up especially after 40% of the film, it really wants to tell something meaningful about him, but eventually moves on with it, providing us with a lack of knowledge of what his wholesome embodies.\n\nHyena &amp; police cop. With a lack of screen time, we do not really see Hyena attacking people at all which some of you might have anticipated. Renee as the cop is one that is really bad at acting, it needs fixing. It is like watching a brick talks with try-hard emotions.\n\nWhile this centres on supervillains, Birds of Prey fails on the costume design. Not a single character clothes himself/herself as a good superhero model portrayal of a costume. It feels very lazy thus, this however tones down the great energy the movie has possessed. It is so bad that varsity students can design them better.\n\nVerdict: Imaginative &amp; darkly flamboyant, Birds of Prey proves that the comeback of DC is possible, adapting many characters into the big screen as a beacon of call to level itself with the colossal Marvel.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-02-07","keywords":"harley quinn character,police,hyena,spin off,chase","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Birds of Prey Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3883843353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMDNjMDQtNjk2ZS00ZGY4LTgzODMtOTAzOTM4MmJhOTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMDNjMDQtNjk2ZS00ZGY4LTgzODMtOTAzOTM4MmJhOTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001609/","name":"Rosie Perez","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935541/","name":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4014166/","name":"Cathy Yan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0637285/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0693170/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5429637/","name":"Christina Hodson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0227704/","name":"Paul Dini","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0863622/","name":"Bruce Timm"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-04-11","keywords":"violence,prison,jakarta indonesia,kitchen fight,corrupt police officer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi530950937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDk5Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDk5Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Immediately following the events of the original, Officer Rama is pressured to join an anti-corruption task force to guarantee protection for his wife and child.

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-04-11","keywords":"violence,prison,jakarta indonesia,kitchen fight,corrupt police officer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi530950937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDk5Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDk5Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Immediately following the events of the original, Officer Rama is pressured to join an anti-corruption task force to guarantee protection for his wife and child.

As Episode 1 opens, Sandra Russo and Robin Young introduce themselves: "I'm your mother", Russo says to the interviewer (and director) Ry Russo-Young. "And I'm your mother too", adds Young. We then go back in time to 1979, as these ladies retell how they met and fell heads over heels for each other and very soon moved in together. Through two sperm donors, each of them has a baby girl. The sperm donors agree to waive all rights (and obligations)... At this point we are 10 min into the opening episode.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest film from Ry Russo-Young ("Before I Fall", "The Sun Is Also a Star"). Here she examines her own life and background, being raised by two moms in the early 80s when that was anything but normal/accepted, even in New York. Both sperm donors are in California, and gave up all parenting and visitation rights, but as luck would have it, they are both on great terms with Russo and Young, and in particular Tom (biological father of Ry) develops strong a strong bond with Ry. What could possibly go wrong? This in turn leads to the question: who/what constitutes a family? Obviously the film maker has unfettered access to her moms, and the series (or at least Episode 1) plays out mostly from that perspective. I can't wait to see the remaining two episodes.\n\n"Nuclear family" premiered last Sunday on HBO and Episode 1 is now available on HBO on Demand, HBO Max and other streaming platforms. New episodes air on Sunday evenings at 10 pm Eastern time. If you have any interest in LGTBQ and related social issues, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2021-09-26","keywords":"tv mini series","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12980711/","name":"Cade Russo-Young"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1735543/","name":"Ry Russo-Young"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1096524/","name":"Jacob Estes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0600458/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208153/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139821/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1438499609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRhMjc1MWQtZjYzOS00MWNiLWE1OTctMGVlMTJhMzZmNjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRhMjc1MWQtZjYzOS00MWNiLWE1OTctMGVlMTJhMzZmNjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg","description":"Ry Russo-Young turns the camera on her own past to explore the meaning of family."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That said, I enjoyed Rise of an Empire more than its predecessor, for two main reasons. The first is that I didn't know how it would end.

It made it too difficult to invest in the characters, and essentially forced me to sit drumming my fingers until their inevitable death. This was, fortunately, not the case here. The second reason is Eva Green. Best known for her breakout role in 2006's Casino Royale, her performance in Rise of an Empire ranges from terrifyingly understated to unintentionally comic, and steals the spotlight at every opportunity. But even she cannot hold up this movie by herself, since the film, for all its merits, relies on little more than its visual effects and art direction.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":289929,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-03-05","keywords":"violent sex,greek,army,navy,antiquity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2982128409","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3Nzk5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg4OTAwMTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3Nzk5NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg4OTAwMTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Greek general Themistokles attempts to unite all of Greece by leading the charge against invading Persian forces led by mortal-turned-god Xerxes and Artemisia vengeful commander of the Persian navy."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0822982/","name":"Sullivan Stapleton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1200692/","name":"Eva Green"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0372176/","name":"Lena Headey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1729171/","name":"Noam Murro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199432/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0811583/","name":"Zack Snyder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0426500/","name":"Kurt Johnstad"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588340/","name":"Frank Miller"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A wonderful actor.\n\nWhat struck me right away was the extremely good, scored intro, the music throughout Dystopia is of I am a genuine fan of classic horror, so I was a bit suspicious when I heard VIAPLAY was doing Dystopia but boy was I surprised for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that it truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is. The Director of Dystopia is Richard Jarnhed and I need to keep an eye out for his future endeavors as he is madly talented.\n\nAnd secondly this was directed by just one director. Richard directed all 8 episodes and that's not normal in Scandinavia.\n\nAnd lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.\n\nThe acting is wonderful and directing is amazing. I was totally blown away by the music!\n\nIt is always nice to see a TV-series with some twists, and also those that give you some food for thought.\n\nI am a bit blown away by the rather week reviews in Swedish press. One outlet even writes that it's outside the box and that they love the box. I am sure Dystopia will do very well internationally!\n\nIf you like Horror tension and at the same time mystery tension you should see Dystopia.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2300,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2021-06-13","keywords":"lesbian kiss,lesbian sex,topless female nudity,larp,larpers","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11198177/","name":"Lola Zackow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4477198/","name":"Madeleine Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7154476/","name":"Johan Hafezi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004517/"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over.

Google it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":795708,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,despair","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we.

I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid.

They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show.

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over.

No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over. Google it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":795708,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,despair","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

By judging on the plot and cover art of the movie I was expecting a flat-out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Sure the movie had some comedy, but it felt much more of a light Drama to me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance. The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found. But, the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable.

By judging on the plot and cover art of the movie I was expecting a flat-out comedy, lots of laughs and unrealistic elements, but I guess I was wrong. Sure the movie had some comedy, but it felt much more of a light Drama to me and Steve Carell once again gave a great performance. The movie itself really tackles true observations and that was a strong element I found. But, the ending felt a little bit rushed and predictable. Through-out, the cinematography was great, the acting was great and the message it delivered was obvious but yet still very important. Though, it came down to old, flat and predictable ending.

Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper who's somewhere behind German lines  For them, it's an abstruse order, but they have to get it done \n\nThroughout the film, Spielberg's attention to detail is amazing  For me, the most chilling scene in the movie is the death of an American officer  It's one of the most intimate  It's also a slightly confusing moment because two German characters resemble each other so greatly \n\nToward the middle, a German soldier called "Steamboat Willie" is introduced  By the end of the film, he has become the 'bad' German  Later in the movie, another German is involved in the final fight  He takes part in an exceedingly painful scene of hand-to-hand combat with the American soldier  The two German soldiers have similar short haircuts and black uniforms  Because they looked so much alike, many of us have believed that they're one character  They're not, and the distinction of the two is very significant","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1303460,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1998-07-24","keywords":"rescue mission,world war two,army,france,unsubtitled foreign language","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Saving Private Ryan","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1701906201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExYjU4OTAtMWM3NS00YzJkLWIzYjQtNTUxMWE5ZWY3MmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjExYjU4OTAtMWM3NS00YzJkLWIzYjQtNTUxMWE5ZWY3MmVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for this wartime drama","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001744/","name":"Tom Sizemore"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734441/","name":"Robert Rodat"],"duration":"PT2H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I'm sure he took on the project to hopefully broaden his demographic (never having done a PG film before). The kids, like most actors their age, constantly overact.

The kids crash into a giant statue of a lumberjack, holding an axe. The axe then falls down and nails Cube right in his groin. Another predictable gag, but after long periods of not laughing, I had to relieve myself in some fashion.

Obviously, this message of accepting kids for who they are, no matter how bratty they get, didn't sink through her head. So why do these films even bother?

When you have a movie as detached from reality as "Are We There Yet?" it's hard to deliver a message to its audience that will linger with them.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31076,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2005-05-25","keywords":"braces,fish out of water,child gagged,reference to lebron james,reference to 50 cent","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Are We There Yet?","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1991704857","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001084/","name":"Ice Cube","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000505/","name":"Nia Long","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0020248/","name":"Aleisha Allen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505152/","name":"Brian Levant"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044714/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1027958/","name":"Steven Gary Banks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1257282/","name":"Claudia Grazioso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826425/","name":"J.

Bee Movie stands as a decent effort that slowly tries to entice us into its colorful animated world. The story deals with a recently graduated bee named Barry (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld) that begins to feel that there's more to life than working his butt off just to fabricate honey. So he decides to train with the Pollen Jocks whose job is to collect pollen from flowers outside the hive. That's how he gets out to the real world, and after a series of jiggling and accidental events, he is saved by Vanessa (voiced by Renée Zellweger) just as her boyfriend was about to squash him. Barry breaks an extremely important rule of bees: never speak to humans. But he does so knowingly just to thank Vanessa for saving his life. After they get to know each other, Barry finds out and immediately reacts outrageously to the fact that humans eat the very same honey that all the bees in the world work exhaustingly to make, just for the humans to make a profit out of it. This leads to a series of events that result in a catastrophic environmental outcome and it becomes Barry's mission to put it back the way it ought to be.\n\nI'm a big Seinfeld fan, but I gotta say, hearing Jerry's voice coming from an animated bee is something of a bizarre experience, as I didn't think his voice really fit the character, and this off-putting perception made the viewing experience a bit distracting.

Bee Movie stands as a decent effort that slowly tries to entice us into its colorful animated world. The story deals with a recently graduated bee named Barry (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld) that begins to feel that there's more to life than working his butt off just to fabricate honey. So he decides to train with the Pollen Jocks whose job is to collect pollen from flowers outside the hive. That's how he gets out to the real world, and after a series of jiggling and accidental events, he is saved by Vanessa (voiced by Renée Zellweger) just as her boyfriend was about to squash him. Barry breaks an extremely important rule of bees: never speak to humans. But he does so knowingly just to thank Vanessa for saving his life. After they get to know each other, Barry finds out and immediately reacts outrageously to the fact that humans eat the very same honey that all the bees in the world work exhaustingly to make, just for the humans to make a profit out of it. This leads to a series of events that result in a catastrophic environmental outcome and it becomes Barry's mission to put it back the way it ought to be.\n\nI'm a big Seinfeld fan, but I gotta say, hearing Jerry's voice coming from an animated bee is something of a bizarre experience, as I didn't think his voice really fit the character, and this off-putting perception made the viewing experience a bit distracting. Seinfeld's voice holds a mature, adult sounding quality to it that it seems inadequate for a young bee fresh out of school. Apart from that, there were some clever jokes and bits like the appearance of Ray Liotta to name one and some obvious ones that should have gone unnoticed for their own sake. Overall I think that is an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half; just immerse youself in the story and try to relate to it, for I'm sure that one of us has felt the way Barry does: unsure about what the future holds concerning job prospects, and worried that it might be the same life day in day out for the rest of your repeated days.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":152397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2007-12-12","keywords":"jazz,larry king character,honey,surrealism,exploitation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bee Movie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi347210009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MjY3MTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM4NDQ4._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MjY3MTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM4NDQ4._V1_.jpg","description":"Bee Movie Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000632/","name":"Jerry Seinfeld","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000111/","name":"Matthew Broderick"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0971239/","name":"Simon J.

I knew this was no action movie or any of the crap we get nowadays. This was true cinema! I was excited 'The Usual Suspects' is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.\n\nAround 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.\n\nThen comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable.

I knew this was no action movie or any of the crap we get nowadays. This was true cinema! I was excited 'The Usual Suspects' is a mystery film about what cargo was on board the ship when it was destroyed and the events leading up to it as we are told from the only known survivor of that accident.\n\nAround 45-50 minutes into the movie, I was starting to find myself a bit tired and thought the movie may perhaps have dragged along just a bit. I was becoming rather disappointed. Then the film truly began to change in such a way that I find it rather hard to explain. The characters began to get a little more entertaining, the pacing certainly began to pick up, the dialogue was getting more interesting and overall, I was more excited.\n\nThen comes the amazing final twenty minutes with the plot twist and the story finally closing in perfectly, making the story more understandable. However, the final 5 minutes of the movie are some of the best moments of movie ever made and that is the ultimate plot twist which surprised the hell out of me!

"Sleepy Hollow" is the perfect kind of movie for his directional Midas touch; it resembles the best of Burton in every way. In the film, an adaptation based on a story by Washington Irving called The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, he captures the slumbering, creepy village of Sleepy Hollow with vivid details and imaginative description. The way everything is presented, the trees look like something out of a fairy tale and the scenery represents deception in a mysterious wonderland, is what makes this production one of the years most captivating and magical film experiences.\n\n \tSome of the visual credit should also be given to the film's Cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, and the credited production designer, Rick Heinrichs. These elements contribute a great deal of success to Burton's masterpiece. Both the design and Cinematography are some of the best seen all year, and deserve a hard earned Oscar Nomination. They make the film intriguing and visually stimulating. \n\n\tThe film takes place in the late 1700's, in New York. Constable Ichabod Crane, a timid and but smart man played by Johnny Depp, is assigned to investigate a series of grizzly murders in a nearby town called Sleepy Hollow. He's rather concerned about his latest task, however, due to the content of the killings. The victim's heads have been sliced, in one clean sweep, straight from their bodies. He accepts his duties, and travels by horse and carriage to the isolated village. \n\n\tOnce Ichabod arrives, the locals, including Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien), and Reverend Steenwyck (Jeffrey Jones), greet him with eagerness. They explain the legend of the headless horseman, who is supposedly causing the murders in their town. At first he is skeptical. Then, after witnessing a victim losing their head personally, he arrives at the conclusion that a headless horseman is responsible for the tragic catastrophes accruing. Ichabod soon meets Katrina Van Tassel, an innocent looking, self spoken young woman who may have some advice, as well as several secrets of her own.\n\n\tThe Headless horseman is a perfect portrayed villain for "Sleepy Hollow." He is brute, oversized, and roughly textured with outwear. The actor who brings him to life when his head is on is perfect for the role; Christopher Walken. For some odd reason, however, popular film critic Roger Ebert reluctantly refused to tell his readers the name of the actor, thinking it would give something away. Well, I am sorry, Mr. Ebert, but it isn't that hard to find this information elsewhere. The filmmakers are not trying to hold Walken as a secret. Stating he stars as the headed horseman gives nothing away. One must see his performance and make up for themselves to even imagine what material the film's bad guy brings forth.\n\n \tTim Burton's direction is focused and wonderfully observant here. The murder sequences are gory and violent, but never way over the top. Burton never losses sight of his main characters, has a good idea about what he wants to place in film, and the special effects do not distract his ability to do so. He has a knack for allowing an audience to become involved with his pictures. We must think for ourselves, figuring out nuggets of the plot on our own, without the projectors help. He has demonstrated these techniques before in such films as "Edward Scissorhands," "The Nightmare Before Christmas," and even the best Batman film yet, "Batman Returns." \n\n \tJohnny Depp offers an Oscar worthy performance as Ichabod Crane. He brings the squeamish role to life effortlessly with striking details and perfect form. He is flawlessly cast, as well as Christina Ricci, who also acts with style and poignancy. Compliments also go out to splendid costuming the actors are permitted to wear. \n\n\tAlthough "Sleepy Hollow" offers lots of creepy impressions, the film is far from being very scary. Some moments do generate some minor thrills, but for the most part, the production is not as terrifying as it could have been. Much of it lacks momentum and build-up for the dozen or so graphic beheadings that take place. Burton could have easily loaded his picture with bombarding amounts of shock value, suspense, and tension filled fright, but instead goes for all out violence, plot, and mystery. Not that this effects the overall production. This is more of an atmospheric movie than a scream feast. The atmosphere is certainly above the average. \n\n\tThe conclusion of "Sleepy Hollow" works in a bizarre, but unpredictable fashion. The climax occurs unexpectedly and excitingly, with much surprise and special effects. The film's foreshadowing is effective, but regardless of how experienced of a filmgoer you are, this is one ending that is not meant to be figured out before it takes place. It is one of the preferred closings I've seen in a while. Despite a few personal objections, "Sleepy Hollow" is a brilliantly crafted work of art--one of the years better films.\n\n \t\t\t\tBrought to you by Paramount Pictures.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":346831,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2000-03-29","keywords":"headless horseman,investigation,sword,legend,beheading","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sleepy Hollow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi428081433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNzc1YjUtNzQxOS00NGI3LThiM2QtMTczZDA3MDI4YjAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNzc1YjUtNzQxOS00NGI3LThiM2QtMTczZDA3MDI4YjAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000207/","name":"Christina Ricci"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001669/","name":"Miranda Richardson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013922/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410331/","name":"Washington Irving"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0944892/","name":"Kevin Yagher"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001825/","name":"Andrew Kevin Walker"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Despite a few personal objections, "Sleepy Hollow" is a brilliantly crafted work of art--one of the years better films.\n\n \t\t\t\tBrought to you by Paramount Pictures.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":346831,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2000-03-29","keywords":"headless horseman,investigation,sword,legend,beheading","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sleepy Hollow","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi428081433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNzc1YjUtNzQxOS00NGI3LThiM2QtMTczZDA3MDI4YjAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQwNzc1YjUtNzQxOS00NGI3LThiM2QtMTczZDA3MDI4YjAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Paramount","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000136/","name":"Johnny Depp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000207/","name":"Christina Ricci","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001669/","name":"Miranda Richardson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0013922/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410331/","name":"Washington Irving","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0944892/","name":"Kevin Yagher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001825/","name":"Andrew Kevin Walker"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Nolte has hired Luis Guzman, a local police officer, to help him in this pursuit and to smooth things over when Nolte disrespects the local populace or their customs. Finally, Valeria Henriquez is quite engaging as the young charmer Lena, who is desperate to join her sister in Minnesota (sold online to a family when they were both in a church orphanage) and will even team up with the "padre" to get there.\n\nWith this good cast and storyline I guess I expected more from this movie, but it lacked dramatic tension and suspense and came across as too flat-toned.

It has possibilities. While it may not for everyone, I had a good time watching it.  This is a TV show for people that enjoy reading. I don't mean that in the way the people say I have a face for radio. I mean it in the way that some people just like to be entertained by a good story rather than be awed by something more spectacular than the last spectacle they saw. I will be honest. From what I've seen so far there doesn't appear to be anything new or revolutionary about the story or its production. It's starting out as a classic revenge (or search for justice) tale in a somewhat familiar swords and sorcery fantasy setting. The important word though is "classic". It's classic for a reason. People like these stories. They're a little bit escapism and a little bit like comfort food. In the end, unlike the real world, you're pretty sure the villain is going to get their just desserts. What you tune in to watch for is the path that the story takes to get there. Unlike, some high-end productions this one doesn't let your own imagination atrophy by showing you every minute detail of its world and its inhabitants right from the beginning. It's not spending its budget on making sure you get to see the muscles of the Grey-skins flex as they crush the bones of their victims. It's enough that you know the the Grey-skins are dangerous. They appear to be concentrating their resources on the story and the actors that bring that story to life. Important points are revealed as the story unfolds and others are be left to the imaginations of viewers that still have one.  I will admit that in my youth, I played Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other RPGs. The settings, the stories, the characters even the tropes are all very familiar to me and I still enjoy them. I enjoyed the first episode and I'm curious to see what happens in the next.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7435,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-07-10","keywords":"witch,the cw,magic,warrior queen,medieval fantasy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4880301/","name":"Jessica Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3940484/","name":"Jake Stormoen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3652548/","name":"Anand Desai-Barochia"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0337558/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0735391/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003899/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131306/","name":"Jason Faller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1344786/","name":"Kynan Griffin"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Outpost Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3940465433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWY5MjJiOGMtMWNkZi00NDQ5LWIyZGEtY2RlNWJlNTBhYWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWY5MjJiOGMtMWNkZi00NDQ5LWIyZGEtY2RlNWJlNTBhYWQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

This film is directed and edited by them and I was seeking for some effective scares. The first act was very formulaic, a group of teenagers decide to spend the weekend at a cabin in the woods now already I am disappointed. The dialogue was moronic along with the characters it is impossible to describe their stupidity as they continue to make poor choices within the situations. It got to the point where I became angry and annoyed but that eventually cooled off after the second act where the exceptional character development finally kicked in, I must agree there were a few cool scenes here and there but the film fails to provide any scares or intelligence within the plot. But during the third act the film explores inside of the spaceship and extends a little on the experimentations the aliens perform on the humans, which is exactly what any alien fan wanted to see, although there were a few scenes that left me confused weather to think this film is a horror or a comedy. After I gave this film a chance it started dosing off to a romantic thriller with the characters apologising and showing affection for each other again, and from that moment the whole film managed to collapse. My expectations were destroyed and the film itself remains a mystery since nothing really makes much sense. I would of appreciated more of an appearance of the aliens and a functioning plot, likable characters and classic "vicious brothers" scares. I will recommend this film to anyone who will watch with an open mind because watching this and expecting it to be the next alien will leave you vastly dissatisfied.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15448,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2014-10-17","keywords":"alien abduction,no survivors,videotape,vietnam war veteran,military cover up","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi377794329","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODMyNzM4OTk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgxNDE4MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODMyNzM4OTk3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDgxNDE4MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A group of friends on a weekend trip to a cabin in the woods find themselves terrorized by alien visitors.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0020329/","name":"Brittany Allen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2238815/","name":"Freddie Stroma"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1536605/","name":"Jesse Moss"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4017355/","name":"Colin Minihan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0447381/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0413004/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0452893/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4017355/","name":"Colin Minihan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3425513/","name":"Stuart Ortiz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4155547/","name":"The Vicious Brothers"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The first act was very formulaic, a group of teenagers decide to spend the weekend at a cabin in the woods now already I am disappointed.
