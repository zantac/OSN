    <desc lang="pt">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar.

Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced.

She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes. She's supposed to portray the strong and independent older woman who can do it all, kids and playing the boss- detective, but it's way to contrived to be the least bit believable. Her character, the rainbow team, the younger cutesy neighbour - who has stamped "love interest" in all caps across his handsome forehead - it's all a stylised light version of a concept we've seen many, many times before. And now it's here again, only worse. Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="pt">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

Some have a weak excuse for a husband to emphasise their strength, many others are independent single mothers who struggle with a demanding job and raising their kids. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the genre. Nothing against strong and independent women, au contraire. I just prefer decent detective work above being sucked into the personal life of a fictional character. If I wanted to see family drama I'd go watch a sitcom. It's beyond me why the detective genre has to be muddled with sitcom-esque fluff like this. (I wouldn't buy it, but it's programmed on TV *instead* of a proper detective).

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

Her character, the rainbow team, the younger cutesy neighbour - who has stamped "love interest" in all caps across his handsome forehead - it's all a stylised light version of a concept we've seen many, many times before. And now it's here again, only worse. Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

By now, I expect any crime show on any network in the US and the UK to have ethnically diverse investigators reporting to a female commander. But as long as the plots make sense and the serious dialogue is leavened with humor, I can put up with all the calibrated political correctness. I've watched a lot of these shows over the years, notwithstanding their occasional triteness.\n\nThis show is PC on steroids. It's is the first show I've ever seen in which MS-13 members are victims. There is a point where the political messaging just gets so tiresome and tendentious that it results in ridiculous plots, terrible dialogue, and total inauthenticity.\n\nI hoped this show would be entertaining even if it wasn't exactly Masterpiece-just ordinary, decent TV. Instead. it is so stupid that it's unwatchable.

Finding its stride in season 2 with a formula which pushes the envelope while still being doable, this series packs ample portions of entertainment into 40 minute episodes while staying fresh, delivering palatable doses of science didactically, and, most of all, manifesting a strong sense of social responsibility in all of its subliminals. While most entertainment aims for the crotch, the gut, or the heart, "CSI" goes for the most difficult target, the head, as it teaches forensics and the empirical process while remaining cooly detached from sensationalism and melodrama all the while using the "truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction" thesis to its and our advantage. The results are fun and interesting lessons in everything from dwarfism to Down syndrome to anatomy to ballistics to etc. all the while maintaining a social conscience. Whether explaining how S&amp;M is not necessarily perversion to simply dissing Don King, "CSI" is one sweet sugar coated education with solid mainstream values. My favorite lines?

I LOVE my city and would LOVE for the series to continue and for us New Orleanians to sound like the intelligent up and coming tech community that we are!

Shocking how bad this is. So disappointing!","reviewBody":"I expect a certain amount of political correctness from a Dick Wolf show. In Law &amp; Order, it was common for the initial suspect--a low level hood from the ghetto--to be innocent, with the ultimate criminal turning out to be a wealthy white executive/headmaster/philanthropist/politician/stereotypical elitist. By now, I expect any crime show on any network in the US and the UK to have ethnically diverse investigators reporting to a female commander. But as long as the plots make sense and the serious dialogue is leavened with humor, I can put up with all the calibrated political correctness. I've watched a lot of these shows over the years, notwithstanding their occasional triteness.\n\nThis show is PC on steroids. It's is the first show I've ever seen in which MS-13 members are victims.

Finding its stride in season 2 with a formula which pushes the envelope while still being doable, this series packs ample portions of entertainment into 40 minute episodes while staying fresh, delivering palatable doses of science didactically, and, most of all, manifesting a strong sense of social responsibility in all of its subliminals. While most entertainment aims for the crotch, the gut, or the heart, "CSI" goes for the most difficult target, the head, as it teaches forensics and the empirical process while remaining cooly detached from sensationalism and melodrama all the while using the "truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction" thesis to its and our advantage. The results are fun and interesting lessons in everything from dwarfism to Down syndrome to anatomy to ballistics to etc. all the while maintaining a social conscience. Whether explaining how S&amp;M is not necessarily perversion to simply dissing Don King, "CSI" is one sweet sugar coated education with solid mainstream values. My favorite lines? CSI1:"There's a sucker born every minute."  CSI2: "Yeah. And they all come to Vegas."

The show is adequate. I've always liked LL Cool J and it's nice to see Chris O'Donnell again. (The nerds suck, especially when you consider Abby from the original show.) But it's the presence of Linda Hunt that elevates this show.

Shocking how bad this is. So disappointing!","reviewBody":"I expect a certain amount of political correctness from a Dick Wolf show. In Law &amp; Order, it was common for the initial suspect--a low level hood from the ghetto--to be innocent, with the ultimate criminal turning out to be a wealthy white executive/headmaster/philanthropist/politician/stereotypical elitist. By now, I expect any crime show on any network in the US and the UK to have ethnically diverse investigators reporting to a female commander. But as long as the plots make sense and the serious dialogue is leavened with humor, I can put up with all the calibrated political correctness. I've watched a lot of these shows over the years, notwithstanding their occasional triteness.\n\nThis show is PC on steroids. It's is the first show I've ever seen in which MS-13 members are victims. There is a point where the political messaging just gets so tiresome and tendentious that it results in ridiculous plots, terrible dialogue, and total inauthenticity.\n\nI hoped this show would be entertaining even if it wasn't exactly Masterpiece-just ordinary, decent TV. Instead. it is so stupid that it's unwatchable. How could a show with its pedigree go so wrong?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13074,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-25","keywords":"violence,police investigation,copaganda,fbi agent,fbi federal bureau of investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335291/","name":"Missy Peregrym","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4976368/","name":"Zeeko Zaki","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005438/","name":"Jeremy Sisto"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019598/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1541762/","name":"Craig Turk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937725/","name":"Dick Wolf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"First Look Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi251968281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM2YTdkNmItYzNhOC00MjBmLWExMDEtZmNmZWZhMTRjNjgwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The show is adequate. I've always liked LL Cool J and it's nice to see Chris O'Donnell again. (The nerds suck, especially when you consider Abby from the original show.) But it's the presence of Linda Hunt that elevates this show. She's a rich, interesting actor and her character here has a great backstory.\n\nSure this team could be managed by yet another grizzled actor playing a tough as nails former Navy Seal type, whose life has been touched by tragedy because his wife died of breast cancer or his little girl choked on a marble. I'd rather have Linda Hunt because she is a true original. I've seen enough shallow cookie cutter actors with impossibly white teeth and ripped abs. Now I want to watch stories about people who are unique and unusual and earthy and human.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50785,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-09-22","keywords":"copaganda,shared universe,spinoff,punctuation in title,male protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000563/","name":"Chris O'Donnell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2079733/","name":"Daniela Ruah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005112/","name":"LL Cool J"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0285100/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0114905/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107402/","name":"Shane Brennan"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2326248985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJjMDg5ZjMtNjczMS00MDc1LTlmMDItY2E3YTE0NzUxNzBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJjMDg5ZjMtNjczMS00MDc1LTlmMDItY2E3YTE0NzUxNzBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="
