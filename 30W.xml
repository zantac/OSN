The common link between CM &amp; CSI is that the question of "How?" is always more interesting.\n\nThe only difference: CSI centers around physical evidence gathering &amp; collecting the pieces to solve a puzzle.\n\nCriminal Minds involves more psychology &amp; sociology. We, as viewers, want to know what makes someone tick as a way to prevent crimes from occurring again.\n\nAnother reason why I enjoy this showed so much is how the characters put their expertise in play to solve some of the most twisted people around.\n\nAs casting is concerned: Patinkin is perfect as Jason Gideon. If you think about it, he's more like a professor citing famous lines from Einstein, Faulkner, etc.\n\nWhen I first read those lines, it didn't make sense at first, but as you watch each episode , the lines that Gideon cites has more meaning to it.\n\nFor example: Einstein: "Imagination is more important than knowledge.Knowledge is limited. Imagination encircles the world." Gideon is saying that the human mind is the deadliest weapon of all, &amp; we are capable of anything &amp; everything of achieving all kinds of possibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, Criminal Minds is the kind the of show that anyone can enjoy."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":177823,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2005-09-22","keywords":"serial killer,serial murder,murder,21st century,2000s","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1131557/","name":"Matthew Gray Gubler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1494536/","name":"Kirsten Vangsness"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176882/","name":"A.J.

To be honest, I'm not a fan of the genre. Nothing against strong and independent women, au contraire. I just prefer decent detective work above being sucked into the personal life of a fictional character. If I wanted to see family drama I'd go watch a sitcom.

She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes. She's supposed to portray the strong and independent older woman who can do it all, kids and playing the boss- detective, but it's way to contrived to be the least bit believable. Her character, the rainbow team, the younger cutesy neighbour - who has stamped "love interest" in all caps across his handsome forehead - it's all a stylised light version of a concept we've seen many, many times before. And now it's here again, only worse. Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Some have a weak excuse for a husband to emphasise their strength, many others are independent single mothers who struggle with a demanding job and raising their kids. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the genre. Nothing against strong and independent women, au contraire. I just prefer decent detective work above being sucked into the personal life of a fictional character. If I wanted to see family drama I'd go watch a sitcom. It's beyond me why the detective genre has to be muddled with sitcom-esque fluff like this. (I wouldn't buy it, but it's programmed on TV *instead* of a proper detective). I can accept a modest degree of family life. After all, Beck and Wallander have families too. However, they are primarily detectives, and every episode is about solving the case. \n\n"Candice Renoir" is more sitcom than detectives. And it's just as tacky and kitschy as the name already suggests. A fifty-something big mama, who seems to think she's Brigitte Bardot in the seventies, miraculously becomes the team leader of a small town detective team. She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes. She's supposed to portray the strong and independent older woman who can do it all, kids and playing the boss- detective, but it's way to contrived to be the least bit believable. Her character, the rainbow team, the younger cutesy neighbour - who has stamped "love interest" in all caps across his handsome forehead - it's all a stylised light version of a concept we've seen many, many times before. And now it's here again, only worse. Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

    <desc lang="pt">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

Some have a weak excuse for a husband to emphasise their strength, many others are independent single mothers who struggle with a demanding job and raising their kids. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the genre. Nothing against strong and independent women, au contraire. I just prefer decent detective work above being sucked into the personal life of a fictional character. If I wanted to see family drama I'd go watch a sitcom. It's beyond me why the detective genre has to be muddled with sitcom-esque fluff like this. (I wouldn't buy it, but it's programmed on TV *instead* of a proper detective). I can accept a modest degree of family life. After all, Beck and Wallander have families too. However, they are primarily detectives, and every episode is about solving the case. \n\n"Candice Renoir" is more sitcom than detectives. And it's just as tacky and kitschy as the name already suggests. A fifty-something big mama, who seems to think she's Brigitte Bardot in the seventies, miraculously becomes the team leader of a small town detective team. She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes. She's supposed to portray the strong and independent older woman who can do it all, kids and playing the boss- detective, but it's way to contrived to be the least bit believable.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 2819924, Title: Candice Renoir, 
 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen. Candice is like a female Columbo version in high heels, handbag pink scarf and a 9mm in her holster." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt2819924/","name":"Candice Renoir","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM3YzUxM2UtZjIyMC00Zjg5LTk0NTMtNGQ3ZWQ0ODhlMTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc0NTExNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France.

Some have a weak excuse for a husband to emphasise their strength, many others are independent single mothers who struggle with a demanding job and raising their kids. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the genre. Nothing against strong and independent women, au contraire. I just prefer decent detective work above being sucked into the personal life of a fictional character. If I wanted to see family drama I'd go watch a sitcom. It's beyond me why the detective genre has to be muddled with sitcom-esque fluff like this. (I wouldn't buy it, but it's programmed on TV *instead* of a proper detective). I can accept a modest degree of family life. After all, Beck and Wallander have families too. However, they are primarily detectives, and every episode is about solving the case. \n\n"Candice Renoir" is more sitcom than detectives. And it's just as tacky and kitschy as the name already suggests. A fifty-something big mama, who seems to think she's Brigitte Bardot in the seventies, miraculously becomes the team leader of a small town detective team. She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes. She's supposed to portray the strong and independent older woman who can do it all, kids and playing the boss- detective, but it's way to contrived to be the least bit believable. Her character, the rainbow team, the younger cutesy neighbour - who has stamped "love interest" in all caps across his handsome forehead - it's all a stylised light version of a concept we've seen many, many times before. And now it's here again, only worse. Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1069,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Finding its stride in season 2 with a formula which pushes the envelope while still being doable, this series packs ample portions of entertainment into 40 minute episodes while staying fresh, delivering palatable doses of science didactically, and, most of all, manifesting a strong sense of social responsibility in all of its subliminals. While most entertainment aims for the crotch, the gut, or the heart, "CSI" goes for the most difficult target, the head, as it teaches forensics and the empirical process while remaining cooly detached from sensationalism and melodrama all the while using the "truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction" thesis to its and our advantage. The results are fun and interesting lessons in everything from dwarfism to Down syndrome to anatomy to ballistics to etc. all the while maintaining a social conscience. Whether explaining how S&amp;M is not necessarily perversion to simply dissing Don King, "CSI" is one sweet sugar coated education with solid mainstream values. My favorite lines? CSI1:"There's a sucker born every minute."  CSI2: "Yeah. And they all come to Vegas."

The show is adequate. I've always liked LL Cool J and it's nice to see Chris O'Donnell again. (The nerds suck, especially when you consider Abby from the original show.) But it's the presence of Linda Hunt that elevates this show. She's a rich, interesting actor and her character here has a great backstory.\n\nSure this team could be managed by yet another grizzled actor playing a tough as nails former Navy Seal type, whose life has been touched by tragedy because his wife died of breast cancer or his little girl choked on a marble. I'd rather have Linda Hunt because she is a true original. I've seen enough shallow cookie cutter actors with impossibly white teeth and ripped abs. Now I want to watch stories about people who are unique and unusual and earthy and human.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50785,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-09-22","keywords":"copaganda,shared universe,spinoff,punctuation in title,male protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000563/","name":"Chris O'Donnell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2079733/","name":"Daniela Ruah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005112/","name":"LL Cool J"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0285100/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0114905/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107402/","name":"Shane Brennan"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2326248985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJjMDg5ZjMtNjczMS00MDc1LTlmMDItY2E3YTE0NzUxNzBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJjMDg5ZjMtNjczMS00MDc1LTlmMDItY2E3YTE0NzUxNzBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I don't really care about Higgins being cast as a woman. What I miss is the relationship in the original show, a relationship which cannot exist in this reboot of the show.\n\nIn the original series, Magnum and Higgins represented two archetypes.\n\nHiggins, the elder of the two, represented a warrior of an older, for formal era. As we learned more about him, we discovered that his stiff upper lip concealed an action-packed history of service.\n\nMagnum, the younger, represented the Viet Nam era. During this time, military service was changing, reflecting the less formal society of the 1960's and 70's. Service people came home with the memories of a wet jungle war and were no longer considered heroes.\n\nOver the course of the series, we saw a grudging growth by both, each gaining respect for the other. While almost never a central element of any story, the ongoing subplot enriched the series. As well, Higgins age and experience allowed the character to be both a hero and a damsel in distress without negative impact.\n\nIn this reboot, Higgins is younger than Magnum. She is intelligent, attractive, supremely confident and competent in almost all things. By resetting the structure in this way, she becomes an antagonistic partner and an ongoing potential love interest. Moreover, if we consider Magnum a competent protagonist, she cannot bring the element of greater experience to the relationship.\n\nThe Higgins character could easily be played by by either a male or female. I suppose that casting Perdita Weeks, who plays what she is given with some skill, was to appeal to middle aged men who enjoy the scenery.

I don't really care about Higgins being cast as a woman. What I miss is the relationship in the original show, a relationship which cannot exist in this reboot of the show.\n\nIn the original series, Magnum and Higgins represented two archetypes.\n\nHiggins, the elder of the two, represented a warrior of an older, for formal era. As we learned more about him, we discovered that his stiff upper lip concealed an action-packed history of service.\n\nMagnum, the younger, represented the Viet Nam era. During this time, military service was changing, reflecting the less formal society of the 1960's and 70's. Service people came home with the memories of a wet jungle war and were no longer considered heroes.\n\nOver the course of the series, we saw a grudging growth by both, each gaining respect for the other. While almost never a central element of any story, the ongoing subplot enriched the series. As well, Higgins age and experience allowed the character to be both a hero and a damsel in distress without negative impact.\n\nIn this reboot, Higgins is younger than Magnum. She is intelligent, attractive, supremely confident and competent in almost all things. By resetting the structure in this way, she becomes an antagonistic partner and an ongoing potential love interest. Moreover, if we consider Magnum a competent protagonist, she cannot bring the element of greater experience to the relationship.\n\nThe Higgins character could easily be played by by either a male or female. I suppose that casting Perdita Weeks, who plays what she is given with some skill, was to appeal to middle aged men who enjoy the scenery. Had they cast a woman 20 years older, a different older chemistry could have blossomed, one of respect, cooperation and affection.

The show is adequate. I've always liked LL Cool J and it's nice to see Chris O'Donnell again. (The nerds suck, especially when you consider Abby from the original show.) But it's the presence of Linda Hunt that elevates this show.

The show is adequate. I've always liked LL Cool J and it's nice to see Chris O'Donnell again. (The nerds suck, especially when you consider Abby from the original show.) But it's the presence of Linda Hunt that elevates this show. She's a rich, interesting actor and her character here has a great backstory.\n\nSure this team could be managed by yet another grizzled actor playing a tough as nails former Navy Seal type, whose life has been touched by tragedy because his wife died of breast cancer or his little girl choked on a marble. I'd rather have Linda Hunt because she is a true original. I've seen enough shallow cookie cutter actors with impossibly white teeth and ripped abs. Now I want to watch stories about people who are unique and unusual and earthy and human.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50785,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-09-22","keywords":"copaganda,shared universe,spinoff,punctuation in title,male protagonist","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000563/","name":"Chris O'Donnell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2079733/","name":"Daniela Ruah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005112/","name":"LL Cool J"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0285100/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0274041/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0114905/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107402/","name":"Shane Brennan"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2326248985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJjMDg5ZjMtNjczMS00MDc1LTlmMDItY2E3YTE0NzUxNzBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjJjMDg5ZjMtNjczMS00MDc1LTlmMDItY2E3YTE0NzUxNzBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I don't really care about Higgins being cast as a woman. What I miss is the relationship in the original show, a relationship which cannot exist in this reboot of the show.\n\nIn the original series, Magnum and Higgins represented two archetypes.\n\nHiggins, the elder of the two, represented a warrior of an older, for formal era. As we learned more about him, we discovered that his stiff upper lip concealed an action-packed history of service.\n\nMagnum, the younger, represented the Viet Nam era. During this time, military service was changing, reflecting the less formal society of the 1960's and 70's. Service people came home with the memories of a wet jungle war and were no longer considered heroes.\n\nOver the course of the series, we saw a grudging growth by both, each gaining respect for the other. While almost never a central element of any story, the ongoing subplot enriched the series. As well, Higgins age and experience allowed the character to be both a hero and a damsel in distress without negative impact.\n\nIn this reboot, Higgins is younger than Magnum. She is intelligent, attractive, supremely confident and competent in almost all things. By resetting the structure in this way, she becomes an antagonistic partner and an ongoing potential love interest. Moreover, if we consider Magnum a competent protagonist, she cannot bring the element of greater experience to the relationship.\n\nThe Higgins character could easily be played by by either a male or female. I suppose that casting Perdita Weeks, who plays what she is given with some skill, was to appeal to middle aged men who enjoy the scenery.

I don't really care about Higgins being cast as a woman. What I miss is the relationship in the original show, a relationship which cannot exist in this reboot of the show.\n\nIn the original series, Magnum and Higgins represented two archetypes.\n\nHiggins, the elder of the two, represented a warrior of an older, for formal era. As we learned more about him, we discovered that his stiff upper lip concealed an action-packed history of service.\n\nMagnum, the younger, represented the Viet Nam era. During this time, military service was changing, reflecting the less formal society of the 1960's and 70's. Service people came home with the memories of a wet jungle war and were no longer considered heroes.\n\nOver the course of the series, we saw a grudging growth by both, each gaining respect for the other. While almost never a central element of any story, the ongoing subplot enriched the series. As well, Higgins age and experience allowed the character to be both a hero and a damsel in distress without negative impact.\n\nIn this reboot, Higgins is younger than Magnum. She is intelligent, attractive, supremely confident and competent in almost all things. By resetting the structure in this way, she becomes an antagonistic partner and an ongoing potential love interest. Moreover, if we consider Magnum a competent protagonist, she cannot bring the element of greater experience to the relationship.\n\nThe Higgins character could easily be played by by either a male or female. I suppose that casting Perdita Weeks, who plays what she is given with some skill, was to appeal to middle aged men who enjoy the scenery. Had they cast a woman 20 years older, a different older chemistry could have blossomed, one of respect, cooperation and affection.
