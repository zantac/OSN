I cannot make an honest opinion yet on the plots and direction of the series until I see more of it, but the imagery alone is a good start for this series.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71645,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-04-01","keywords":"sex scene,king,royalty,king henry viii,english court","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001667/","name":"Jonathan Rhys Meyers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0147147/","name":"Henry Cavill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0112390/","name":"Anthony Brophy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078130/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052980/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0082215/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0386694/","name":"Michael Hirst"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Tudors: Season 4: The Final Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3776092441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwY2E4Y2EtNmMyNy00MjFiLTg0ODgtNWVhMzhlYTQ0OTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwY2E4Y2EtNmMyNy00MjFiLTg0ODgtNWVhMzhlYTQ0OTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Tudors: The Final Season"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest). \n\nI loved their choice of actors to take on the roles of Jamie, Claire, Frank and Dugan. Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser (just the right bit of good looks and ruggedness one might expect in Jamie). Caitriona Balfe also seemed like a good choice for Claire (beautiful yet strong enough to carry the role). I think Frank/Jack Randall's portrayal by Tobias Menzies will also fit my vision of Frank/Jack and I think he can carry off both roles one as the wicked Jack and the other as the loving yet dull Frank (when compared to Jamie). And the Scottish actors like Graham McTavish (Dougal) will bring old Scotland to life on the screen for me. \n\nFrom the 1st episode I think they producers will not be shy to include the more sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to span centuries, even when they are no longer together. It's that love/passion for each other that keeps them alive in each other's heart and so far to the directors credit, they have not been shy about adding it. I'm looking forward to the Claire Jamie love scenes hopefully to come... I'm also going to enjoy the Scottish history and scenery, and loved the way they so far have included it in the TV series. It's going to be very interesting to me especially as my ancestors are Scottish.\n\nI know Starz will be increasing its revenues with this series' fans all signing up just to see it. There must be millions of us around the world that love these books and I'm sure like me many of them will order the cable channel just to watch this. I'm very happy to see Starz did such a good job in bringing this to life on the screen. So rarely do we get a good adult drama on TV these days, and this will surely be that. I'm liking many of the original show Starz is offering this season like this and Black Sails, Strikback. Who ever is heading their creative development deserves a lot of credit for their selection of shows to produce. I think Starz is catching up to HBO and Showtime in it's original shows and might even surpass them if it keeps producing shows of this quality plus they have a much better selection of movies that the other channels. As a new Starz member, I'd recommend it to others.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-08-09","keywords":"scotland,scotsman,year 1743,scottish highlands,sex scene","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1495520/","name":"Caitriona Balfe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1537825/","name":"Sam Heughan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3795370/","name":"Duncan Lacroix"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0303436/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0410831/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208971/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601822/","name":"Ronald D.

I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest). \n\nI loved their choice of actors to take on the roles of Jamie, Claire, Frank and Dugan. Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser (just the right bit of good looks and ruggedness one might expect in Jamie). Caitriona Balfe also seemed like a good choice for Claire (beautiful yet strong enough to carry the role). I think Frank/Jack Randall's portrayal by Tobias Menzies will also fit my vision of Frank/Jack and I think he can carry off both roles one as the wicked Jack and the other as the loving yet dull Frank (when compared to Jamie). And the Scottish actors like Graham McTavish (Dougal) will bring old Scotland to life on the screen for me. \n\nFrom the 1st episode I think they producers will not be shy to include the more sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to span centuries, even when they are no longer together. It's that love/passion for each other that keeps them alive in each other's heart and so far to the directors credit, they have not been shy about adding it. I'm looking forward to the Claire Jamie love scenes hopefully to come... I'm also going to enjoy the Scottish history and scenery, and loved the way they so far have included it in the TV series. It's going to be very interesting to me especially as my ancestors are Scottish.\n\nI know Starz will be increasing its revenues with this series' fans all signing up just to see it. There must be millions of us around the world that love these books and I'm sure like me many of them will order the cable channel just to watch this. I'm very happy to see Starz did such a good job in bringing this to life on the screen. So rarely do we get a good adult drama on TV these days, and this will surely be that. I'm liking many of the original show Starz is offering this season like this and Black Sails, Strikback.

Some have a weak excuse for a husband to emphasise their strength, many others are independent single mothers who struggle with a demanding job and raising their kids. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the genre. Nothing against strong and independent women, au contraire. I just prefer decent detective work above being sucked into the personal life of a fictional character. If I wanted to see family drama I'd go watch a sitcom. It's beyond me why the detective genre has to be muddled with sitcom-esque fluff like this. (I wouldn't buy it, but it's programmed on TV *instead* of a proper detective). I can accept a modest degree of family life. After all, Beck and Wallander have families too. However, they are primarily detectives, and every episode is about solving the case. \n\n"Candice Renoir" is more sitcom than detectives. And it's just as tacky and kitschy as the name already suggests. A fifty-something big mama, who seems to think she's Brigitte Bardot in the seventies, miraculously becomes the team leader of a small town detective team. She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes. She's supposed to portray the strong and independent older woman who can do it all, kids and playing the boss- detective, but it's way to contrived to be the least bit believable. Her character, the rainbow team, the younger cutesy neighbour - who has stamped "love interest" in all caps across his handsome forehead - it's all a stylised light version of a concept we've seen many, many times before. And now it's here again, only worse. Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest). \n\nI loved their choice of actors to take on the roles of Jamie, Claire, Frank and Dugan. Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser (just the right bit of good looks and ruggedness one might expect in Jamie). Caitriona Balfe also seemed like a good choice for Claire (beautiful yet strong enough to carry the role). I think Frank/Jack Randall's portrayal by Tobias Menzies will also fit my vision of Frank/Jack and I think he can carry off both roles one as the wicked Jack and the other as the loving yet dull Frank (when compared to Jamie). And the Scottish actors like Graham McTavish (Dougal) will bring old Scotland to life on the screen for me. \n\nFrom the 1st episode I think they producers will not be shy to include the more sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to span centuries, even when they are no longer together. It's that love/passion for each other that keeps them alive in each other's heart and so far to the directors credit, they have not been shy about adding it. I'm looking forward to the Claire Jamie love scenes hopefully to come... I'm also going to enjoy the Scottish history and scenery, and loved the way they so far have included it in the TV series. It's going to be very interesting to me especially as my ancestors are Scottish.\n\nI know Starz will be increasing its revenues with this series' fans all signing up just to see it. There must be millions of us around the world that love these books and I'm sure like me many of them will order the cable channel just to watch this. I'm very happy to see Starz did such a good job in bringing this to life on the screen. So rarely do we get a good adult drama on TV these days, and this will surely be that. I'm liking many of the original show Starz is offering this season like this and Black Sails, Strikback. Who ever is heading their creative development deserves a lot of credit for their selection of shows to produce. I think Starz is catching up to HBO and Showtime in it's original shows and might even surpass them if it keeps producing shows of this quality plus they have a much better selection of movies that the other channels. As a new Starz member, I'd recommend it to others.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-08-09","keywords":"scotland,scotsman,year 1743,scottish highlands,sex scene","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1495520/","name":"Caitriona Balfe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1537825/","name":"Sam Heughan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3795370/","name":"Duncan Lacroix"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0303436/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0410831/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208971/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601822/","name":"Ronald D.

I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest). \n\nI loved their choice of actors to take on the roles of Jamie, Claire, Frank and Dugan. Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser (just the right bit of good looks and ruggedness one might expect in Jamie). Caitriona Balfe also seemed like a good choice for Claire (beautiful yet strong enough to carry the role). I think Frank/Jack Randall's portrayal by Tobias Menzies will also fit my vision of Frank/Jack and I think he can carry off both roles one as the wicked Jack and the other as the loving yet dull Frank (when compared to Jamie). And the Scottish actors like Graham McTavish (Dougal) will bring old Scotland to life on the screen for me. \n\nFrom the 1st episode I think they producers will not be shy to include the more sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to span centuries, even when they are no longer together. It's that love/passion for each other that keeps them alive in each other's heart and so far to the directors credit, they have not been shy about adding it. I'm looking forward to the Claire Jamie love scenes hopefully to come... I'm also going to enjoy the Scottish history and scenery, and loved the way they so far have included it in the TV series. It's going to be very interesting to me especially as my ancestors are Scottish.\n\nI know Starz will be increasing its revenues with this series' fans all signing up just to see it. There must be millions of us around the world that love these books and I'm sure like me many of them will order the cable channel just to watch this. I'm very happy to see Starz did such a good job in bringing this to life on the screen. So rarely do we get a good adult drama on TV these days, and this will surely be that. I'm liking many of the original show Starz is offering this season like this and Black Sails, Strikback. Who ever is heading their creative development deserves a lot of credit for their selection of shows to produce. I think Starz is catching up to HBO and Showtime in it's original shows and might even surpass them if it keeps producing shows of this quality plus they have a much better selection of movies that the other channels. As a new Starz member, I'd recommend it to others.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-08-09","keywords":"scotland,scotsman,year 1743,scottish highlands,sex scene","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1495520/","name":"Caitriona Balfe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1537825/","name":"Sam Heughan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3795370/","name":"Duncan Lacroix"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0303436/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0410831/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208971/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601822/","name":"Ronald D.

Her character, the rainbow team, the younger cutesy neighbour - who has stamped "love interest" in all caps across his handsome forehead - it's all a stylised light version of a concept we've seen many, many times before. And now it's here again, only worse. Yay. \n\nTo be fair, the acting of the team and other characters varies from passable to decent, but the lead actress is really milking the diva character, and as such, overacting horribly in just about every scene.\n\nIt might just about do as daytime TV, on a rainy afternoon, but that's probably me being generous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"TV-G","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"france,female police officer,police","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0092291/","name":"Cécile Bois"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501845/","name":"Raphaël Lenglet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6511436/","name":"Clara Antoons"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0053077/","name":"Robin Barataud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0043904/","name":"Brigitte Peskine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2784794/","name":"Solen Roy-Pagenault"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Promo Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2892283161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FhNWFlYmItYmE5My00ZmM0LThlZDctZGE5YjhiMThkZDQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest). \n\nI loved their choice of actors to take on the roles of Jamie, Claire, Frank and Dugan. Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser (just the right bit of good looks and ruggedness one might expect in Jamie). Caitriona Balfe also seemed like a good choice for Claire (beautiful yet strong enough to carry the role). I think Frank/Jack Randall's portrayal by Tobias Menzies will also fit my vision of Frank/Jack and I think he can carry off both roles one as the wicked Jack and the other as the loving yet dull Frank (when compared to Jamie). And the Scottish actors like Graham McTavish (Dougal) will bring old Scotland to life on the screen for me. \n\nFrom the 1st episode I think they producers will not be shy to include the more sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to span centuries, even when they are no longer together. It's that love/passion for each other that keeps them alive in each other's heart and so far to the directors credit, they have not been shy about adding it. I'm looking forward to the Claire Jamie love scenes hopefully to come... I'm also going to enjoy the Scottish history and scenery, and loved the way they so far have included it in the TV series. It's going to be very interesting to me especially as my ancestors are Scottish.\n\nI know Starz will be increasing its revenues with this series' fans all signing up just to see it. There must be millions of us around the world that love these books and I'm sure like me many of them will order the cable channel just to watch this. I'm very happy to see Starz did such a good job in bringing this to life on the screen. So rarely do we get a good adult drama on TV these days, and this will surely be that. I'm liking many of the original show Starz is offering this season like this and Black Sails, Strikback. Who ever is heading their creative development deserves a lot of credit for their selection of shows to produce. I think Starz is catching up to HBO and Showtime in it's original shows and might even surpass them if it keeps producing shows of this quality plus they have a much better selection of movies that the other channels. As a new Starz member, I'd recommend it to others.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-08-09","keywords":"scotland,scotsman,year 1743,scottish highlands,sex scene","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1495520/","name":"Caitriona Balfe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1537825/","name":"Sam Heughan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3795370/","name":"Duncan Lacroix"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0303436/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0410831/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208971/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601822/","name":"Ronald D.

I must say I loved the Outlander books, but I'm not a fanatic when it comes to translating books to the screen they are very different mediums and thus can take on a different look and feel and that's OK with me. In this case, I don't think people who are would be disappointed anyway as the screen writers did an excellent job of translating the 1st part of the book to the screen (I've only seen the 1st episode but I'm already hooked so I'm sure I'll enjoy the rest). \n\nI loved their choice of actors to take on the roles of Jamie, Claire, Frank and Dugan. Sam Heughan is perfect as Jamie Fraser (just the right bit of good looks and ruggedness one might expect in Jamie). Caitriona Balfe also seemed like a good choice for Claire (beautiful yet strong enough to carry the role). I think Frank/Jack Randall's portrayal by Tobias Menzies will also fit my vision of Frank/Jack and I think he can carry off both roles one as the wicked Jack and the other as the loving yet dull Frank (when compared to Jamie). And the Scottish actors like Graham McTavish (Dougal) will bring old Scotland to life on the screen for me. \n\nFrom the 1st episode I think they producers will not be shy to include the more sexual aspects of the Outlander books, as they do have this erotic element that actually makes the love between Claire and Jamie the driving force of their relationship which allows it to span centuries, even when they are no longer together. It's that love/passion for each other that keeps them alive in each other's heart and so far to the directors credit, they have not been shy about adding it. I'm looking forward to the Claire Jamie love scenes hopefully to come... I'm also going to enjoy the Scottish history and scenery, and loved the way they so far have included it in the TV series. It's going to be very interesting to me especially as my ancestors are Scottish.\n\nI know Starz will be increasing its revenues with this series' fans all signing up just to see it. There must be millions of us around the world that love these books and I'm sure like me many of them will order the cable channel just to watch this. I'm very happy to see Starz did such a good job in bringing this to life on the screen. So rarely do we get a good adult drama on TV these days, and this will surely be that. I'm liking many of the original show Starz is offering this season like this and Black Sails, Strikback. Who ever is heading their creative development deserves a lot of credit for their selection of shows to produce. I think Starz is catching up to HBO and Showtime in it's original shows and might even surpass them if it keeps producing shows of this quality plus they have a much better selection of movies that the other channels. As a new Starz member, I'd recommend it to others.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-08-09","keywords":"scotland,scotsman,year 1743,scottish highlands,sex scene","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1495520/","name":"Caitriona Balfe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1537825/","name":"Sam Heughan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3795370/","name":"Duncan Lacroix"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0303436/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0410831/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208971/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0601822/","name":"Ronald D.

    <desc lang="pt">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

Some have a weak excuse for a husband to emphasise their strength, many others are independent single mothers who struggle with a demanding job and raising their kids. To be honest, I'm not a fan of the genre. Nothing against strong and independent women, au contraire. I just prefer decent detective work above being sucked into the personal life of a fictional character. If I wanted to see family drama I'd go watch a sitcom. It's beyond me why the detective genre has to be muddled with sitcom-esque fluff like this. (I wouldn't buy it, but it's programmed on TV *instead* of a proper detective). I can accept a modest degree of family life. After all, Beck and Wallander have families too. However, they are primarily detectives, and every episode is about solving the case. \n\n"Candice Renoir" is more sitcom than detectives. And it's just as tacky and kitschy as the name already suggests. A fifty-something big mama, who seems to think she's Brigitte Bardot in the seventies, miraculously becomes the team leader of a small town detective team. She blunders through everything, but 'magically' finds clues in fashion magazines and the likes. She's supposed to portray the strong and independent older woman who can do it all, kids and playing the boss- detective, but it's way to contrived to be the least bit believable.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

All he does is pose. They should make it into a drinking game. Every time he strikes a pose, take a shot. Of course, people have died from alcohol poisoning. This would only add to the statistics. All the other characters have depth. He just gets this look on his face and 'strikes a pose'. Watch him turn sideways and look over his shoulder. Wow!! OOOhhh, he figured out something. Time for him to take off his sunglasses. I challenge any of you to find an episode where he isn't positioned sideways looking over his shoulder and where he takes off his sunglasses. Quit posing and pretend like you know how to act!!!!\n\nAnd, how come he has to figure everything out? The other shows let the other characters show some brains. How 'bout letting the other CSI Vogue characters have a little spotlight?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":55488,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-09-23","keywords":"place name in title,city name in title,city in title,united states of america,usa","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000325/","name":"David Caruso","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0698346/","name":"Emily Procter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0735226/","name":"Adam Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048735/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231929/","name":"Ann Donahue","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578856/","name":"Carol Mendelsohn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0958499/","name":"Anthony E.

Time for him to take off his sunglasses. I challenge any of you to find an episode where he isn't positioned sideways looking over his shoulder and where he takes off his sunglasses. Quit posing and pretend like you know how to act!!!!\n\nAnd, how come he has to figure everything out? The other shows let the other characters show some brains.

Time for him to take off his sunglasses. I challenge any of you to find an episode where he isn't positioned sideways looking over his shoulder and where he takes off his sunglasses. Quit posing and pretend like you know how to act!!!!\n\nAnd, how come he has to figure everything out? The other shows let the other characters show some brains.
