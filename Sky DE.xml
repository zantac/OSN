    <review type="text">IMDb review: It seems to me that 'Money' is a perfect, elegant and flawless product; a very stylized classic drama. While I was watching it, movies like The Rope (Alfred Hitchcock, 1948) or Wait Until Dark (Terence Young, 1967) came to my mind. The movie is concise, pragmatic and straightforward. Its goals are clear and they know how to reach them. Its message is, on top of that, beautiful, illuminating and not indulgent. The tension is built up in a superb manner for a movie that needs to keep us in suspense. And the director's work with the actors is sublime. With perhaps the exception of Kellan Lutz, more inexpressive, they are all splendid, and that makes the text shine and the credibility of what is taking place escalate. In that sense, the actor's direction is spectacular. At times, the necessity of filming hastily is noticeable, but not so much because of the editing, which is perfect, with just some isolated glimpses that can be observed. However, it is more noticeable in the staging: it looks like there wasn't time to plan a proper communicative meaning beyond what's functional. There is not a genuine relationship between the characters and the space, not a single shot provides more information than what the characters verbally announce. It would have been a spectacular movie if they had taken more risks in that sense. It would have been even better if they had what every movie lacks of: time! But, in spite of that, everything in 'Money' is believable, accurate and intense. Concision, focusing on a single location, a right pace in the dialogues, witty replicas and great performances are but a few of its virtues. In that sense, 'Money' is a complete success</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Despite the rush of people on IMDb who seem strangely desperate to trash this new show; I personally, as a fan of procedural crime dramas and team "puzzle of the week" shows like House M.D, really quite enjoy Bull so far. The first episode had an intriguing premise, the second episode built up the team members' characters enough to at least make them likable, and I think Michael Weatherly is enjoying the role massively and it shows in his winning performance. The psychological aspect of the show is something I don't think we see enough of on television in general and even if some of it is pumped up into quick, flashy computer bites, it still aids the story which is really all it's meant to do. As shows in their infancy go, I think this one is off to a promising start. Bull is a well-shot bit of interesting fun and I will definitely keep watching</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Despite the rush of people on IMDb who seem strangely desperate to trash this new show; I personally, as a fan of procedural crime dramas and team "puzzle of the week" shows like House M.D, really quite enjoy Bull so far. The first episode had an intriguing premise, the second episode built up the team members' characters enough to at least make them likable, and I think Michael Weatherly is enjoying the role massively and it shows in his winning performance. The psychological aspect of the show is something I don't think we see enough of on television in general and even if some of it is pumped up into quick, flashy computer bites, it still aids the story which is really all it's meant to do. As shows in their infancy go, I think this one is off to a promising start. Bull is a well-shot bit of interesting fun and I will definitely keep watching</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Despite the rush of people on IMDb who seem strangely desperate to trash this new show; I personally, as a fan of procedural crime dramas and team "puzzle of the week" shows like House M.D, really quite enjoy Bull so far. The first episode had an intriguing premise, the second episode built up the team members' characters enough to at least make them likable, and I think Michael Weatherly is enjoying the role massively and it shows in his winning performance. The psychological aspect of the show is something I don't think we see enough of on television in general and even if some of it is pumped up into quick, flashy computer bites, it still aids the story which is really all it's meant to do. As shows in their infancy go, I think this one is off to a promising start. Bull is a well-shot bit of interesting fun and I will definitely keep watching</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: "Joy Ride" is an extremely entertaining road-set horror/thriller that was surprisingly quite good. The film is about Lewis (Paul Walker), a college coed who decides to buy himself a car and take off across the desert to pick up a would-be-girlfriend, Venna (Leelee Sobieski) in Colorado for a road trip together. He then learns that his older troubled brother, Fuller (Steve Zahn) has been arrested in Salt Lake City, so he picks him up on the way. After having a CB radio installed into the car, the two take off to pick up Venna, but end up pulling a prank on an anonymous trucker who goes by the name of "Rusty Nail" (excellently voiced by Ted Levine) on the CB radio. After the trucker learns about the prank, he attacks the brothers with his large semi, but they manage to escape. But soon after they pick up Venna, the menacing truck driver begins harassing them again, seeking revenge for the joke they decided to play on him - he'll stop at nothing to get it, and he's looking for more than an apology.Reminiscent of "The Hitcher" in quite a few ways, but also a much different film, "Joy Ride" was a surprise for me. I was expecting something along the lines of your typical teenage-horror fare, and I was pleasantly surprised with this intelligent and heart-pounding little thriller of a film. To start off, the story in itself is very nicely written and manages to avoid clichés. The characters in this film are smart, and the audience is rooting for them the entire way through. There are some excellently orchestrated thrill sequences, one of them being the really intense chase through the cornfield, among others, and these scenes are sure to get you on the edge of your seat.Tension builds slowly during the first 40 minutes or so, and from there it just goes rampant. The cast is led by Paul Walker, who hasn't accomplished anything too amazing, but manages to lead the film well and play his character believably. Steve Zahn in his quirky and funny older brother, and plays the part suitably. Leelee Sobieski plays the intuitive girl-next-door friend who ends up along for the ride, and she also gives a worthy performance. The psycho-trucker villain of the film is very scary, never really seen - we get to know him through the frightening conversations on the CB radio, where he makes numerous threats and has many disturbing confrontations with the group of friends. Ted Levine, who played the notorious Buffalo Bill in "The Silence of the Lambs" voices the psychopath, and his voice itself is creepy enough, and adds to the villain's overall demeanor. The ending was excellent, and I loved how ominous it was. I really didn't see it coming, and it concluded on a very unnerving note.Overall, "Joy Ride" is a superior action-filled horror/thriller that came as a big surprise to me. It was intelligent, tense, scary, and very well-written, which was nice because of my semi-low (no pun intended) expectations going into it. People who enjoyed "The Hitcher" will more than likely also enjoy this road trip from hell. Very well done and worth seeing for both horror and thriller fans alike. 8/10</review>

 --- Viewers reactions: Scary Road Thriller Somewhat Reminiscent of "The Hitcher". ... A surprisingly engrossing and effective thriller. Not all that original but extremely entertaining. ... Pretty intense thriller ... "How about that one 'Candy Cane', cum'on...break, break!" ... A nice well made B-movie, a little winner!</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: To be honest, I didn't become a real fan of the series until Jerry Orbach (Detective Briscoe)and Sam Waterston(EADA McCoy)came into the picture. This is when the series starts to pick up steam. Watching the show, you can't help but laugh at Briscoe's remarks or feel the passion of McCoy. Both of these men want justice, and will do everything within limits to bring the wrongdoers to justice. What I really like about the show is the wonderful twists and turns that they throw to the audience, as well as the "ripped from the headlines" episodes. Even though you have 2 more in the "Law And Order" franchise, the original is STILL the best</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: As a New Orleans native I implore you and the writers to walk down any street in New Orleans and talk to a LOCAL. We DO NOT eat shrimp and grits for breakfast and praline bacon isn't in our fridge. We have worked very hard to come back from Katrina and it PAINS ME that this series (which I love and watch regularly) is making us look like uneducated loud mouth pigs. Please - come uptown and take a census of LOCALS, have a LOCAL help you with the dialect!! We DO NOT talk like that unless your're from Mississippi. PLEASE! I LOVE my city and would LOVE for the series to continue and for us New Orleanians to sound like the intelligent up and coming tech community that we are! Thank you</review>

 --- Review: As a New Orleans native I implore you and the writers to walk down any street in New Orleans and talk to a LOCAL. We DO NOT eat shrimp and grits for breakfast and praline bacon isn't in our fridge. We have worked very hard to come back from Katrina and it PAINS ME that this series (which I love and watch regularly) is making us look like uneducated loud mouth pigs. Please - come uptown and take a census of LOCALS, have a LOCAL help you with the dialect!! We DO NOT talk like that unless your're from Mississippi. PLEASE! I LOVE my city and would LOVE for the series to continue and for us New Orleanians to sound like the intelligent up and coming tech community that we are! Thank you
 --- Viewers reactions: Review of NCIS New Orleans ... My favorite NCIS ... NCIS New Orleans. was fine up until this past 3 weeks. ... Lost me as viewer to much politics ... Gone downhill big time</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Despite the rush of people on IMDb who seem strangely desperate to trash this new show; I personally, as a fan of procedural crime dramas and team "puzzle of the week" shows like House M.D, really quite enjoy Bull so far. The first episode had an intriguing premise, the second episode built up the team members' characters enough to at least make them likable, and I think Michael Weatherly is enjoying the role massively and it shows in his winning performance. The psychological aspect of the show is something I don't think we see enough of on television in general and even if some of it is pumped up into quick, flashy computer bites, it still aids the story which is really all it's meant to do. As shows in their infancy go, I think this one is off to a promising start. Bull is a well-shot bit of interesting fun and I will definitely keep watching</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Despite the rush of people on IMDb who seem strangely desperate to trash this new show; I personally, as a fan of procedural crime dramas and team "puzzle of the week" shows like House M.D, really quite enjoy Bull so far. The first episode had an intriguing premise, the second episode built up the team members' characters enough to at least make them likable, and I think Michael Weatherly is enjoying the role massively and it shows in his winning performance. The psychological aspect of the show is something I don't think we see enough of on television in general and even if some of it is pumped up into quick, flashy computer bites, it still aids the story which is really all it's meant to do. As shows in their infancy go, I think this one is off to a promising start. Bull is a well-shot bit of interesting fun and I will definitely keep watching</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Mrs. Shullivan and I have been fans of the Law and Order TV series from its original series starting in 1990 through to the current re- creation of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit (1999) now in its 18th season. It is no wonder that this new 8 part mini series covering the high profile trial in 1994 of Lyle (aged 21) and Erik (aged 19) Menéndez for the 1989 murder by shotgun of their wealthy parents, José and his wife, Mary ("Kitty") in their Beverly Hills home would be released some 30 years after the murders first occurred. José Enrique and Kitty Menéndez spoiled their only two sons, and so when the murders were first made public there was no end of rumors who could be responsible for these two cold blooded execution style murders. Unless you are under the age of 30, you may not be familiar with just how high profile these murders were at the time (1984) and the eventual trial by tabloid newspapers of the two sons Erik and Lyle Menéndez. I have seen the two earlier made for TV movies of the Menéndez murders both of which starred A-lister film stars.In the 1994 TV movie "Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez Murders" it starred A-list actors James Farentino, and Jill Clayburgh, John Beck and Susan Blakely. In the second made for TV movie "Menendez: A Killing in Beverly Hills" starred Edward James Olmos, Beverly D'Angelo, and Damian Chapa.This new 8 episode mini-series also has some A-list TV stars such as Edie Falco (Carmela Soprano of The Sopranos) and Chris Bauer (The Wire and also Third Watch). I am going to go out on a limb based on just watching the first episode that this mini series will be based on factual evidence and the court transcripts. Edie Falco plays a defense attorney named Leslie Abramson who seems to be very opinionated although in the opening episode she is not yet familiar with any of the case evidence, nor yet introduced to the two Menéndez brothers, Erik and Lyle.A good benchmark in assessing if a mini-series is worth watching or not is if the episode(s) seem to end much quicker than you expected, or wanted it to. Such is the case with the opening episode of Law &amp; Order: True Crime, it ended almost as quickly as the lives of José Enrique and Kitty Menéndez did. I give the opening episode a 7/10 rating and I will update my review after this mini-series has concluded</review>

It is no wonder that this new 8 part mini series covering the high profile trial in 1994 of Lyle (aged 21) and Erik (aged 19) Menéndez for the 1989 murder by shotgun of their wealthy parents, José and his wife, Mary ("Kitty") in their Beverly Hills home would be released some 30 years after the murders first occurred. José Enrique and Kitty Menéndez spoiled their only two sons, and so when the murders were first made public there was no end of rumors who could be responsible for these two cold blooded execution style murders. Unless you are under the age of 30, you may not be familiar with just how high profile these murders were at the time (1984) and the eventual trial by tabloid newspapers of the two sons Erik and Lyle Menéndez. I have seen the two earlier made for TV movies of the Menéndez murders both of which starred A-lister film stars.In the 1994 TV movie "Honor Thy Father and Mother: The True Story of the Menendez Murders" it starred A-list actors James Farentino, and Jill Clayburgh, John Beck and Susan Blakely. In the second made for TV movie "Menendez: A Killing in Beverly Hills" starred Edward James Olmos, Beverly D'Angelo, and Damian Chapa.This new 8 episode mini-series also has some A-list TV stars such as Edie Falco (Carmela Soprano of The Sopranos) and Chris Bauer (The Wire and also Third Watch). I am going to go out on a limb based on just watching the first episode that this mini series will be based on factual evidence and the court transcripts. Edie Falco plays a defense attorney named Leslie Abramson who seems to be very opinionated although in the opening episode she is not yet familiar with any of the case evidence, nor yet introduced to the two Menéndez brothers, Erik and Lyle.A good benchmark in assessing if a mini-series is worth watching or not is if the episode(s) seem to end much quicker than you expected, or wanted it to. Such is the case with the opening episode of Law &amp; Order: True Crime, it ended almost as quickly as the lives of José Enrique and Kitty Menéndez did. I give the opening episode a 7/10 rating and I will update my review after this mini-series has concluded</review>

 --- Viewers reactions: A decent opening episode for this 8 part mini series ... Promising start.. ... Biased-Major Facts Altered &amp; Left Out ... As if the Menendez Brothers Wrote the Script ... Ok here's the thing ...</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Despite the rush of people on IMDb who seem strangely desperate to trash this new show; I personally, as a fan of procedural crime dramas and team "puzzle of the week" shows like House M.D, really quite enjoy Bull so far. The first episode had an intriguing premise, the second episode built up the team members' characters enough to at least make them likable, and I think Michael Weatherly is enjoying the role massively and it shows in his winning performance. The psychological aspect of the show is something I don't think we see enough of on television in general and even if some of it is pumped up into quick, flashy computer bites, it still aids the story which is really all it's meant to do. As shows in their infancy go, I think this one is off to a promising start. Bull is a well-shot bit of interesting fun and I will definitely keep watching</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: It is an understatement to say I was pretty much disappointed after the third episode. Everything was there - well, in theory: my favorite genre, a good plot, a great cast, the famous British humor. But something was just off and I even tried watching the first three episodes again after the season finale, but no. I simply don't and can't like them, not sure why.The fourth episode was the game changer. I though it was the first decent one, even had a few laughs ("meh" was my default reaction to any attempt at humor in the previous eps), so I decided to at least try and finish the season.The next three offered a definitive upward momentum in terms of storytelling and humor. There was literally no dialogue, no sentence without at least a dash of perfectly dosed humor.I watched the season finale alone, and it was so funny at moments it made me spew random comments and laugh out loud all by myself.It is a great show, it is a unique show - please, PLEASE don't give up on it! Watch till the end, you won't regret your choice</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: It is an understatement to say I was pretty much disappointed after the third episode. Everything was there - well, in theory: my favorite genre, a good plot, a great cast, the famous British humor. But something was just off and I even tried watching the first three episodes again after the season finale, but no. I simply don't and can't like them, not sure why.The fourth episode was the game changer. I though it was the first decent one, even had a few laughs ("meh" was my default reaction to any attempt at humor in the previous eps), so I decided to at least try and finish the season.The next three offered a definitive upward momentum in terms of storytelling and humor. There was literally no dialogue, no sentence without at least a dash of perfectly dosed humor.I watched the season finale alone, and it was so funny at moments it made me spew random comments and laugh out loud all by myself.It is a great show, it is a unique show - please, PLEASE don't give up on it! Watch till the end, you won't regret your choice</review>

 --- Review: If you know anything about the 3 main actors in this show, you should know what to expect, and if you like these guys and their sense of humor in their other roles, I think you'll enjoy this show. I really liked it and think it deserves better ratings than it has, but I can see how it may not be for everyone
 --- Viewers reactions: I'm glad I didn't dismiss this based on poor ratings ... Very watchable series about awkward people trying to get along ... It is not great, but it is also nowhere as terrible as some people here claim. ... I really enjoyed Moonbase 8 ... Great new comedy</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: It is an understatement to say I was pretty much disappointed after the third episode. Everything was there - well, in theory: my favorite genre, a good plot, a great cast, the famous British humor. But something was just off and I even tried watching the first three episodes again after the season finale, but no. I simply don't and can't like them, not sure why.The fourth episode was the game changer. I though it was the first decent one, even had a few laughs ("meh" was my default reaction to any attempt at humor in the previous eps), so I decided to at least try and finish the season.The next three offered a definitive upward momentum in terms of storytelling and humor. There was literally no dialogue, no sentence without at least a dash of perfectly dosed humor.I watched the season finale alone, and it was so funny at moments it made me spew random comments and laugh out loud all by myself.It is a great show, it is a unique show - please, PLEASE don't give up on it! Watch till the end, you won't regret your choice</review>

 --- Review: It is an understatement to say I was pretty much disappointed after the third episode. Everything was there - well, in theory: my favorite genre, a good plot, a great cast, the famous British humor. But something was just off and I even tried watching the first three episodes again after the season finale, but no. I simply don't and can't like them, not sure why.The fourth episode was the game changer. I though it was the first decent one, even had a few laughs ("meh" was my default reaction to any attempt at humor in the previous eps), so I decided to at least try and finish the season.The next three offered a definitive upward momentum in terms of storytelling and humor. There was literally no dialogue, no sentence without at least a dash of perfectly dosed humor.I watched the season finale alone, and it was so funny at moments it made me spew random comments and laugh out loud all by myself.It is a great show, it is a unique show - please, PLEASE don't give up on it! Watch till the end, you won't regret your choice
 --- Viewers reactions: So glad I didn't stop watching! ... Space for improvement. ... Brilliantly Absurd ... Well I love it ... I don't get the hate...</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Berlin, 1964, Nazi Germany."Fatherland" is one of Ruger Hauer's better recent movies. It takes a look at what would have happened if Nazi Germany had survived, even if the US had never gone to war with Germany.The movie shows the grandiose architectural empire that Hitler had planned to make out of Berlin, as it would look on his 75th birthday. The special effects are notable more for their subtlety than dramatics, many of the fictional monuments look perfectly natural. The appearance of Nazi era clothes and uniforms against a sixties era eastern europe looks both plausible and surreal.The movie itself focuses on a patriotic cop (Hauer) and an american journalist who look into a series of murders that involved the "greatest secret" of the Reich."Fatherland" is a better than average drama and at the same a very disturbing look at how history could have turned out differently</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: THE LATE SHIFT was an interesting made for HBO movie that took a detailed look at the power struggle that ensued between David Letterman and Jay Leno when Johnny Carson announced his retirement and both wanted to replace him. This struggle is now part of Hollywood folklore, but for those who don't know the story and are aware of where Letterman is now, it might be interesting to learn that David Letterman wanted to replace Johnny Carson as host of THE TONIGHT SHOW more than anything in the world, but Letterman found his dreams being derailed as frequent guest host Leno had one of Hollywood's most powerful agents, Helen Kushnick, in his corner and working tirelessly to get her client the job. It's not often that we get to see behind the scenes Hollywood machinations recreated for entertainment value, but for fans of these two late night superstars, this movie provided a fascinating look at a very turbulent period in late night television. According to this movie, Letterman was practically promised the job by Carson himself while NBC had promised the job to Leno and that's where Helen Kushnick came in. The movie presents Leno as sort of a milquetoast who allowed his career to be manipulated by Kushnick and feigned ignorance to some of Helen's strong-willed manipulations of some of NBC's biggest power players and it presents Letterman as this smart and savvy businessman who, despite having Carson's support, was railroaded by NBC and Kushnick. John Michael Higgins and Daniel Roebuck credibly recreate Letterman and Leno, respectively, but it is the razor-sharp performance of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Helen Kushnick that keeps this movie bubbling. Bates commands the screen in one of her best, if not so well-known performances as the venomous Hollywood agent who eats television studio executives for breakfast. There is also a wonderful turn by impressionist Rich Little as Johnny Carson, but it is primarily a fascinating story and the powerhouse performance by Bates that make this one worth checking out</review>

 --- Viewers reactions: A Fascinating Look at one of Hollywood's most interesting Power Struggles ... Well done and good original movie dramatization that's funny and tense while taking a behind the scenes look at the late night TV wars of the early 90's. ...

I'm just afraid Hollywood will screw up as it always does and pull the show off the air. So, I'm telling you people, watch the the first episode and you'll know what you're missing.

Well here I am four days later and I'm on episode 10 of season 6. Wowzer does this show blow me away. I love the grittiness, the laughs, the emotional value and the edge of your seat action that I get from this show. I read alot of the reviews on here and kept hearing about how season 5 was a disappointment. Well I couldn't agree less. Every season has been amazing. I'm actually dreading that I'm coming up to the end. Happy to read that they have already started production of season 7. This show is a win in my book. Highly recommend. And it doesn't hurt that I am a Boston girl, born and raised. Love shows that make me feel at home</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I didn't want to watch this because I adore the BBC Sherlock. However, after denying myself for weeks and weeks I decided to download the first 8 episodes and get to work watching them before I made a full opinion. I was surprised at how easy it was to fall in love with Jonny Lee Miller's Sherlock and Lucy Liu's female Watson. Both actors brought their A-Game and succeeded in bringing viewers in, despite the un-original procedural aspect to the show. The crimes of the week are lackluster and pedestrian at the very beginning, a typical trait of typical procedural dramas on broadcast networks. However, thankfully this did not continue for all the 12 episodes that have been aired. Somewhere along the 6th episode is when I assume the writers got the full season pick-up and felt the support of CBS after being given the coveted Super Bowl episode slot. Now the crimes are interesting and layered. The best thing is that the characterization of Sherlock and Watson is the best thing I've seen on a drama in years. Lucy and Jonny have a platonic chemistry which brings angst, sarcasm and wit to the show that is very enjoyable. The character scenes are the best in every episode, and you can't deny the acting skill involved to breath fresh air into an over used double act such as Holmes and Watson. Miller and Liu make you forget about the other interpretations and fall in love all over again with the crime solving duo. I suggest everyone watches before passing judgement, and be open minded. You can like all Sherlock Holmes adaptions, there is no rule against liking another.Elementary is going to be a fantastic series, and I hope it lasts a long time on CBS. It's refreshing and adds vitality to a very old network. Great show</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Along with TV-shows like 'Oz', 'Deadwood', 'The Sopranos' and 'Six Feet Under', David Simon's 'The Wire' was part of a revolution - qualitywise - in television. Although it is very entertaining, this isn't just entertainment; this is art, pure and simple - and the concept of this show was groundbreaking. On the surface, one might think this is a show about crime, but really, 'The Wire' is about the life and soul of a whole city. Every aspect of the city of Baltimore gets its share of screen time, and the way this is done - the writing, the direction, the amazing performances by the terrific cast; the music, the camera work, the realism... I could go on and on - is just outstanding. On par with 'Generation Kill' (no wonder, since the same creative team was behind both), this is as good as television gets.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387</review>

 --- Review: You'll have to decide yourself, with topics as big and with so many opinions and moving parts, reviews will be bias forsure!!!Regardless of political opinion 'The Comey Rule' is one hell of a production. The cast alone deserves your attention but beside the big name actors and the characters they portray this series is extremely entertaining
 --- Viewers reactions: Leave your politics at the door ... Not a Russian bot ... It was better than I expected... ... Unmissable ... worth watching</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I'm going to be honest about this: I like unabashedly violent action films. I'm 42 years old, I'm from Texas and I can take it. Growing up with films like 'Rambo', 'Die Hard', 'The Terminator' and 'Robocop', I can't stand that watered-down "no-blood-no-swearing" gutless kiddie fare that is being served as "action" these days. I know the real thing when I see it - we used to see it all the time back in the day - and I hardly ever see it anymore.Which brings me to this movie. 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' was being shown just around the corner from where I live, and because I loved two of director Matthew Vaughn's previous films, 'Layer Cake' and 'Kick-Ass', I naturally took the chance to see it. I had already read some comments from previous screenings that this film was totally bad-ass, and I can now say that's actually putting it mildly. This film is nothing short of bat-shît crazy.Years ago Tarantino said in an interview that he had written a James Bond script and that he would love to direct a Bond film. Sadly, that never happened, but ever since I read that I wondered what an R-rated Bond might be like. I don't know, maybe Matthew Vaughn has read that interview too and saw the potential, because 'Kingsman' is pretty much that: An ultra violent, funny, crazy, foul-mouthed James Bond film (with a little bit of 'Men in Black' and 'Mission Impossible' thrown in). You could say that this is to Bond what 'Game of Thrones' is to 'Lord of the Rings': Where the former can't and dare not go (for marketing and box office reasons), the latter joyfully and gloriously ventures. Dirty and (very black) humor - check. Bad language - check. Gratuitous violence - check. Needless to say, I was thrilled.But it's also a fantastic action film with an amazing cast (Oscar winners Colin Firth and Michael Caine, plus Sam Jackson AND Mark Hamill) and spectacular, over-the-top fight-scenes that in some instances even rival films like 'The Raid' for their sheer visceral intensity. In short, if you're as fed up with lame wannabe Die-Hards and Terminators as I am, go watch this film. Apart from the rare 'John Wick' or 'Equalizer', 'Kingsman' seems to be pretty much the only antidote to the toothless, generic tripe Hollywood tries to pass for action these days. 9 stars for the film and the story, 11 stars for the balls to pull this off the way they did. Average = a perfect 10.EDIT:P.S. I recently stumbled upon an article on the importance of R rated movies. If you're a film fan (especially of films that don't cater to teenagers), you might find it as enlightening as I have:www.the-fanboy-perspective.com/the-importance-of-the-r-rating.html</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Plot summary: In a prohibition era update of Yojimbo, Bruce Willis shoots a load of gangsters.First off I will never understand why Walter Hill does not have a better reputation. He's probably best known for his commercial success with the 48 Hrs films, and his other brilliant features get criminally overlooked. He scored a cult hit with "The Warriors", he delivered one of the best westerns ever with "The Long Riders", and put all other car chase movies to shame with the ultra cool "The Driver." As anyone who has seen these films should realise, Hill should be mentioned in the same breath as Peckinpah, Woo and Rodriguez when it comes to slow-mo gunplay."Last Man Standing" doesn't rival these earlier works, but it is a tough, gritty film with some fantastic shootouts. It doesn't hold itself back in terms of blood and violence, something current US films of the genre are guilty of doing. It has everything an action film needs; tough antihero, loath able bad guys, a creepy main villain and plenty of cannon fodder. As long as you don't get hung up on technicalities (ie the guns fire ten times more ammo than they hold) you should be entertained.It doesn't feel like any effort went into the screenplay, but Hill adds some nice touches to the film in terms of nods towards the source material. I particularly like the opening where Bruce spins his empty whisky bottle on the ground to decide which road to take; a clear reference to Toshiro Mifune throwing a stick into the air to decide on his path. There is also an interesting cast; there's earlier Hill collaborator Bruce Dern (The memorable villain from The Driver), William Sanderson (Blade Runner) and of course Christopher Walken, who chews the scenery talking tough with his hoarse accent and threatening people with a Tommy gun. His performance is really the most memorable thing about the film. Willis is not Mifune or Eastwood, but he does suit the mysterious drifter character well and this is one of his better action man roles.All things said, the film certainly doesn't come close to "Yojimbo", but it does give the more rough hewn "Fistful of Dollars" a run for its money. By no means a masterpiece, "Last Man Standing" should still provide enough for any action fans tired of watered down mainstream Hollywood nonsense that currently dilutes cinemas. It is certainly a lot better than its reputation makes out</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I literally just came back from a midnight screening of this and I had an amazing time. Craven's managed to reclaim the franchise with a worthy instalment that's a fantastic sequel as well as a quality slasher film in its own right. Honestly speaking, there aren't too many surprises to be had in Scream 4. No matter how mordantly self-aware the movies are (and believe me, Scream 4 gets a little tediously indulgent in its postmodern cleverness), there's an inevitable predictability to some of the proceedings but anybody who's a genre-savvy horror fan will appreciate how brilliantly everything is executed. The opening sequences, for example, are one of the best parts of the movie and are a perfect reintroduction to the franchise and while the bulk of the story lags a little, it's redeemed by the ballsy ending.The acting is great with the core trio (Campbell, Arquette and Cox) delivering their usual, strong performances and the rest of the cast, however limited their respective roles, are just as entertaining. All you TV buffs there will get a kick out of seeing actors from Heroes, Veronica Mars, True Blood, Mad Men and Community share the silver screen and camp it up. More importantly, the film is hilarious and just a whole lot of ridiculous fun. Craven isn't afraid to take the story to some beautifully insane places and the ending was, to me, perfect. All in all, it's a great, irreverent slice of horror that's hilarious and true to the franchise. Highly recommended</review>

 --- Review: I literally just came back from a midnight screening of this and I had an amazing time. Craven's managed to reclaim the franchise with a worthy instalment that's a fantastic sequel as well as a quality slasher film in its own right.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: "The boys dressed themselves, hid their accoutrements, and went off grieving that there were no outlaws any more, and wondering what modern civilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss. They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest than President of the United States forever." Mark Twain's Adventures of Tom Sawyer In 3:10 to Yuma, a few references to The Magnificent Seven and the idea of a train arriving at a specific time when good and bad guys converge, as in High Noon, made viewing this Glenn Ford remake from 1957 a pleasant one. And right I was but for even more good reasons.Not since Unforgiven and The Quick and the Dead have I been as excited about seeing a Western in its heroic and revisionist forms. 3:10 to Yuma is a true Western in the American film tradition about the 19th-century American West: It has clear heroes and villains (and a mixture of those), wide prairies, dirty towns, fast guns, weak lawmen, cunning murderers, kids on the cusp, and women marginalized, just for starters.Then ratchet up to the philosophical/post modern/post Eastwood reflections on the profession of being a gunman juxtaposed with being a responsible father, and you have an classic angst-filled clash where villain has a wee bit of heart and hero an equal measure of cowardice. Delightfully mix in a certifiable baddie in the Lee Van Cleef/Jack Palance tradition, Ben Foster (Alpha Dog) as Wade's amoral lieutenant Charlie Prince (as in "of darkness"). Best of all, it is nail-bitingly suspenseful and beautifully photographed.In order to pickup some home-saving cash, poor crippled farmer Dan Evans (Christian Bale) is helping transport murderer Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) to court via the 3:10 to Yuma from Bisbee, Arizona. Getting Wade to the station is no easy task, even for the several deputies, because Wade's evil gang is in hot pursuit and more importantly, Wade is psychologically working on them from within, alternately charming and brutal; just imagine his roguish smile behind an extremely fast gun and unscrupulous conscience.It's hard to believe a studio could dump such a winner in the dog days of summer. I will say only that if you have even a modicum of respect for this genre, see 3:10 to Yuma and relive the golden days of straight-up shoot-em ups with rough-hewn characters, electric plot, and revisionist attitude about the romance of being an outlaw or a farmer.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: It's Jet Li vs. Jason Statham in War, an exciting martial arts action film. An FBI agent out for revenge pursues a notorious assassin named Rogue who's come to San Francisco to instigate a war between the Triads and the Yakuza. The storytelling is rather good, especially in creating suspense and intrigue. And, the fight sequences are particularly impressive. However, the characters aren't given much depth and seem more like stereotypes. While War is pretty much a typical revenge film, it's entertaining and has a good cast</review>

 --- Review: It's Jet Li vs. Jason Statham in War, an exciting martial arts action film. An FBI agent out for revenge pursues a notorious assassin named Rogue who's come to San Francisco to instigate a war between the Triads and the Yakuza. The storytelling is rather good, especially in creating suspense and intrigue. And, the fight sequences are particularly impressive. However, the characters aren't given much depth and seem more like stereotypes. While War is pretty much a typical revenge film, it's entertaining and has a good cast
 --- Viewers reactions: It's good movie to watch ... For the fan boys ... Reasons to see WAR ... "War"--The title gives it away ... It's Mayhem, Pure-And-Simple</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: You are probably not going to see this film for riveting story-lines and in depth character studies. The RE series has about action and fun sequences. Leaving aside all the ridiculous plot points and lazy screen writing, the editing of this movie is going to become legendary for it's awfulness.I've never seen a full budgeted movie get hacked up so poorly that the expensive action scenes are pretty much butchered to the max. This movie needs to be studied in film school for how NOT to edit a movie. Every single action is shot with countless shakes, moves, and camera switches. A simple action of, say, putting away your knife, takes 3- 4 camera edits. I was counting them by 15 minutes in per shot. It was insane. A fight sequence will be nothing but a countless series of quick edits form close up, medium and far away shots mashed together so it's impossible to follow what's going on. Shaky cam is one thing, but this is shaky cam plus strobe effect editing. Every single punch or shot requires 4-6 edits and quick cuts. It will give you a headache to figure out what's happening in any fight or sequence. Even mundane actions like people standing on top of a building looking down takes 5-6 edits and quick cuts? Bring the puke bag.I guess they tried to film some neat locations and the costumes are pretty and sets, but you wont even notice with the multiple edits jarring your eyes</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Firefox isn't your usual Eastwood film, he's almost branching out into Star Wars territory here with this Sci-Fi heavy Cold War Spy thriller. The effects like every 80's film have dated badly but for a movie made in 1982 they are rather good. Eastwood directs himself in what is a pretty average performance by his own high standards. The majority of the cast is made up by British character actors. Warren Clarke is really good but Freddie Jones and Nigel Hawthorne are pretty hammy. Also Raiders of the Lost Ark fans can spot Ronald Lacey playing Semelovsky a Jewish scientist. The first half of the film is a spy thriller and can be pretty nail biting at times as Clint gets his papers checked at regular intervals. Also he's suffering from the same post Vietnam War disorder that John Rambo had in First Blood and that really adds to the tension. The second half is more like Star Wars and is really great stuff. So better ice up at a cold one and enjoy Firefox for what it is, Cold War entertainment at it's best</review>

A lot of people didn't like this movie, but I did and I would recommend it
 --- Viewers reactions: Transformers ... It's our fault, really... ... What I expected ... Could have been better, but could have been much worse! ... Seriously...what happened?</review>

This film revolves around Jessica(Kim Basinger) she was kidnapped, and she dials a random number which is Ryan's number (Chris Evans) who being coward person , he avoids helping people too .Howeve Ryan will launch in an incredible race against time to save Jessica, as well as he has no idea about what await him.The film was very amusing,exciting and entertaining. Besides i was well written,well acted and well directed. We as Moroccan people we can watch it with our parents, that's means that this movie does no include scenes which are inappropriate, so "Cellular" can be watched by all age categories.Personally I think that this film transmit an important message to boys, especially to careless boys.All in all, I really enjoyed watching this captivating film</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: First off, everyone is entitled to their own opinions, but most of the low ratings I am seeing are criticizing "The Mummy" because of it's "weak plot" or someone even said that this movie could have been written by the person's dog!Does anyone realize that there is different movie genres? If you go to see "The Mummy" and expect to see "The Departed", "The Godfather", or "Shawshank Redemption" then yes, of course you will be disappointed. This is not a drama, it's an action/adventure movie! Everyone has commented on the fun of this movie, that is what this movie is all about! Personally, I think the story is very good, and interesting. There is a lot to like here: it has elements of action, adventure, comedy, fantasy, mythology, horror, and tells a pretty well made tale (seriously, how many movies manage to pull all of these things off? And pull them off well!). And, it manages to do all of this in style, with amazing special effects and action sequences. No, it's not perfect (what movie is?) but this movie kills most movies in the same genre! I have never seen a movie that can contain so many different elements while still being coherent. This movie is a technical marvel is many aspects!Rachel Weisz is great and looks beautiful as well playing as Evelyn. Yes, she is something like a "typical damsel in distress", but she brings humor, intelligence, and a strong will to the part. It's hard to integrate so many qualities into a believable character, but she does it well.Brendan Fraser as Rick O'Connell: After seeing him in so many goofy movies, playing an equally goofy character, I thought he was always going to be cast in lame movies such as "Encino Man" and "Monkeybones". He was the reason why I had doubts I would like the movie because I could not picture him being more than a one-dimensional actor (able to pull goofy-charismatic off only). Not only does he act the part with stride, but he nails every aspect of his character: He is cool, yet has humor and he really surprised me with how much depth he can add to a role that really doesn't need it! Rick O'Connell wields his dual guns with flair, and I will never doubt Fraser again! I just hope they keep him utilized more and more like this. I was really impressed with him most because he surpassed all expectations!Everyone else did their parts extremely well, they always stay in character, and add to the elements of the story. This movie has a lot to offer, and lots of different ways to get your interest, especially if the Ancient Egyptian mythology fascinates you. This movie does have elements of horror: it will most likely scare younger kids more than adults, but putting yourself in the characters places you would be quite afraid. Imhotep is very scary, mostly because of all the different abilities he possesses, as well as forms he can take. I could not recommend this movie enough, especially if you have a HDTV and have the High Definition version, you will be blown away! Just don't expect a character driven drama, you're not looking for that with this either</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: It is one of the best movies made by director Martin Scorsese. It is perhaps the best movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Honestly speaking, it is one of the greatest films of the decade. DiCaprio featured in two movies in 2010, the other one being "Inception". Both were excellent. To this day, they are some of the best cinematic experience I have ever had. That being said, I found "Shutter Island" to be much more superior, as "Inception" feels a little bit of a mumbo jumbo many times.Good."Shutter Island" is simply a masterpiece. The beginning of the movie suggests a very basic plot of a detective story, possibly a thriller. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes bigger and bigger with more and more complexity added to it. The way this happens is incredible. The pacing is really good. That is what makes the movie so interesting. And, even though the movie gets more complex, it is not difficult to keep up with the major plot points. And, the final twist is one of the best plot twists I have ever seen. I did not expect it at all. And, like the main character portrayed by DiCaprio, we are not ready to believe what is being told until a lot of reveals finally convince us. There are a lot of many things that might seem to be pointless before the final twist which are totally relevant with the story that is actually being told. The character of Edward Daniels is superbly written. We get to know where the character is coming from and we can get behind the character - yet another excellent thing about this movie. There are some dream sequences that seems like a filler, but is a major indication to the reveal. There are quite many "illusions" which feel very real, but carry no real meaning in the end. There are many additional things which may seem like a diversion from the story being told, but are actually enhancing it. Some dialogues between the main character and an imprisoned character get a very different interpretation after it's all set and done. So much of a complex story, yet no giant inconsistencies at all. It's just superbly written and directed and acted. It's totally different from "Memento" (2000) but still, has a lot of similarities. We get into the main character's head and we just get his interpretations, different types though. Towards the end, we don't want to step fully outside his head, but when we finally do, it's mind blowing. The ending moments were conceived by many to be confusing. But, if you keep up with the entire story, it's meaning is quite obvious. The movie is dark and psychologically engrossing. Yet it does have a short lived and very brief happy moment with the tiny plotline involving Dr. Cawley's motives. That's all I can say without getting into complete spoilers. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsly have given some of the great performances till date. I don't have anything that bugged me. So no mixed or bad aspects of the film.Conclusion.On the whole, for me, it's the movie of the decade. The decade is almost over, and still I have not got any movie in the league of "Shutter Island". It's a very engaging and thrilling movie. It's one of those films I consider to be an all time great.Rating.Score : absolute 10/10Grade : A+</review>

 --- Review: It is one of the best movies made by director Martin Scorsese. It is perhaps the best movie starring Leonardo DiCaprio. Honestly speaking, it is one of the greatest films of the decade. DiCaprio featured in two movies in 2010, the other one being "Inception". Both were excellent. To this day, they are some of the best cinematic experience I have ever had. That being said, I found "Shutter Island" to be much more superior, as "Inception" feels a little bit of a mumbo jumbo many times.Good."Shutter Island" is simply a masterpiece. The beginning of the movie suggests a very basic plot of a detective story, possibly a thriller. As the movie progresses, the plot becomes bigger and bigger with more and more complexity added to it. The way this happens is incredible. The pacing is really good. That is what makes the movie so interesting. And, even though the movie gets more complex, it is not difficult to keep up with the major plot points. And, the final twist is one of the best plot twists I have ever seen. I did not expect it at all. And, like the main character portrayed by DiCaprio, we are not ready to believe what is being told until a lot of reveals finally convince us. There are a lot of many things that might seem to be pointless before the final twist which are totally relevant with the story that is actually being told. The character of Edward Daniels is superbly written. We get to know where the character is coming from and we can get behind the character - yet another excellent thing about this movie. There are some dream sequences that seems like a filler, but is a major indication to the reveal. There are quite many "illusions" which feel very real, but carry no real meaning in the end. There are many additional things which may seem like a diversion from the story being told, but are actually enhancing it. Some dialogues between the main character and an imprisoned character get a very different interpretation after it's all set and done. So much of a complex story, yet no giant inconsistencies at all. It's just superbly written and directed and acted. It's totally different from "Memento" (2000) but still, has a lot of similarities. We get into the main character's head and we just get his interpretations, different types though. Towards the end, we don't want to step fully outside his head, but when we finally do, it's mind blowing. The ending moments were conceived by many to be confusing. But, if you keep up with the entire story, it's meaning is quite obvious. The movie is dark and psychologically engrossing. Yet it does have a short lived and very brief happy moment with the tiny plotline involving Dr. Cawley's motives. That's all I can say without getting into complete spoilers. Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo and Ben Kingsly have given some of the great performances till date. I don't have anything that bugged me. So no mixed or bad aspects of the film.Conclusion.On the whole, for me, it's the movie of the decade. The decade is almost over, and still I have not got any movie in the league of "Shutter Island". It's a very engaging and thrilling movie. It's one of those films I consider to be an all time great.Rating.Score : absolute 10/10Grade : A+

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Because Closer is, in a way, like sneaking a peek behind the closed doors of people we know, or more so, like looking in a mirror when we are at our most base and humanly human, some people seem to be viscerally turned off by it, as is apparent by a few of its more negative reviews.To me, the very fact that it opens the door to such "voyeurism", if you will, is part of its deep emotional appeal.Who among us can say we have never been tempted to be lured away from what we believe is love, by what we momentarily believe to be love? In closer, however these moments go beyond temptation, into lies, deceit, infidelity, misery, painful truths, abandonment, tears and suffering. "Love", in Closer, is shown to be against everything we've been taught to believe it should be, such as: honest/truthful, enduring, constant ... and faithful.In short, it is a rabidly anti-romantic film, where, unbelievably, somewhere within each of these broken, self-serving, selfish, emotionally-underdeveloped people, brilliantly played by Jude Law, Julia Roberts, Clive Ovens and Natalie Portman, we find beauty, and in the end, a deep satisfaction upon seeing that love of self can lead to release and rebirth.It had been a while since I watched this, and I am happy to say that I loved it this time around as much as the first time I laid eyes on it. And isn't that the mark of real love? That it endures?Closer, is one of my favorite films.9.5</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: "Eat, Pray, Love" is about a wealthy, over-privileged woman who has a mid-life crises and instead of buying a sports car, she divorces her husband, has some affairs, and spends a boat-load of money.I guess the moral of the story is that money can buy happiness.This is the type of movie that makes people want to join the "occupy" movement. The whole point of the movie is that over-indulging is the way to find yourself and be happy.And just to pour salt in the wound, in the scene where she is eating pasta in Italy is done to the music of Mozart's German opera "The Magic Flute." I guess nobody associated with this piece of trash was smart enough to tell the difference between Italian and German.Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage</review>

 --- Review: "Eat, Pray, Love" is about a wealthy, over-privileged woman who has a mid-life crises and instead of buying a sports car, she divorces her husband, has some affairs, and spends a boat-load of money.I guess the moral of the story is that money can buy happiness.This is the type of movie that makes people want to join the "occupy" movement. The whole point of the movie is that over-indulging is the way to find yourself and be happy.And just to pour salt in the wound, in the scene where she is eating pasta in Italy is done to the music of Mozart's German opera "The Magic Flute." I guess nobody associated with this piece of trash was smart enough to tell the difference between Italian and German.Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage
 --- Viewers reactions: I Guess Money Can Buy Happiness ... The greatest emotion I felt from the film was hunger (for Italian pizza), thirst (for Italian wine) ... Watch, sleep, forget ... What planet is she from? ... This. Movie. Sucks.</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: First of all, Seven Years In Tibet is a very aesthetically pleasing film. The snowy Himalayas, the Tibetan villages, and the amazing costumes and religious ceremonies are all filmed beautifully, with rich colours and lighting. The music by John Williams is also excellent, and it's fascinating to hear how it blends with the unusual Tibetan music.It's not all surface though, there's depth here too. Don't believe the negative comments about Brad Pitt's acting. Admittedly his accent slips a bit in places, but he does a great job as Heinrich, both the unpleasant, arrogant character at the beginning, and the more gentle and wise man that he becomes as the film progresses. His relationship with the young Dalai Lama (a very impressive actor) is an unusual one and refreshingly unsentimental. The film is well edited; scenes are not drawn out any longer than they need to be. As a whole, it is fast paced but also peaceful, tender and moving. You don't get bored but you're not bombarded with pointless action scenes either.It's a pleasant surprise to see a Hollywood film where women and other cultures aren't treated as objects, and are allowed to be full, complex characters. It could be argued that this film has a Western perspective, but after all, it is adapted from a book written by a European living in Tibet, and intended for Western audiences. It treats the Tibetan culture with a great deal of respect, so I don't really see a problem with that. Similarly, those who have complained that it doesn't tell you enough about the Dalai Lama and too much about Heinrich, ultimately it is Heinrich's story, and that is its strength: that it is one man's tale, and not a political polemic. It gives you a great sense of how people's stories intersect and how the whole world is connected.Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: A few years ago I saw this remake of the sixties classic with the Mini Coopers for the first time and I remember liking it a lot. Now, about two years later it was shown on television and I just wanted to know whether I would still like it as much as when I saw it in the cinema. Well, the answer is yes.The movie is about a team of robbers that will do one final job in Venice, Italy. The plan is flawless and the execution perfect. They escape and won't have to work for the rest of their lives. But there is one problem they didn't take into account: Someone within their own ranks doesn't like to split the loot, but wants to keep it all for himself, even when that means he will have to kill the rest of the crew. But all but one survive and they are out for revenge. One year later, in Los Angeles this time, the surviving team members create a smart and devious plan to steal back the gold and get their revenge on the traitor...The story on itself is of course not very original, since this is a remake of the original 1969 movie, but it has plenty of goodies to offer to make you forget about that. This is a typical heist / action movie but it certainly is one of the better ones in its kind. The action is very nice, the landscapes and Venice are real eye-candy, the story is OK and the special effects are stunning. Even the acting is very good, something which you'll not often see in an action movie. I must admit that I really liked what I saw and I give this movie a well deserved 7.5/10</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Boogie Nights is perhaps one of the greatest examples any would-be filmmaker should take a long hard look at. Sure, you could spend loads of quality time reviewing the clasics from Hitchcock to Scorsese; but lets follow suit for the modern generation and study half-heartedly.Where to begin, I suppose one could look at the film as simply a story, perhaps even docudrama which focuses on the late 1970's porn industry-and what an industry it was! The other half could focus on the incredible detail one brillant filmmaker can achieve simply by using polyester and *ahem* rubber. But honestly, Boogie Nights brings back the pure, no-bul!shi$, in your face kind of cinema I haven't experienced since the film greats of the 1970's...ironic...or stroke of genius. The story is full of richly detailed characters, all of which you either can relate too, love, or hate; but the impact is clear-you are feeling something for them. Among the characters the two performances which stand out are: Burt Reynolds as Director Jack Horner, and Mark Wahlberg as Eddie Adams/Dirk Diggler. Julianne Moore is also brillant, as is Heather Graham...but if I focus on any one actor it would have to be John C. Reilly. John's performance is a perfect balance of comedic timing and character driven emotion...I'm a sucker for the line "Ever see the movie Star Wars?...People say I look like Han Solo." Anyway, the look of the film is incredible, the Director of Photography and Director/Writer/Producer, have come up with a vibrant colour, and flashy style that compares to Martin Scorsese, and Stanley Kubrick(in terms of his perfection of his craft); but with creating his own unique look, and pushing the edge with the longest single shot I'ver ever seen...that being the New Year's party sequence.The music, like in any great film, is a character of its own. At times, it consumes oneself with sorrow or grief...but mainly its all about fun, dancing, and having a good time; the spirit of the 1970's. OK, back to the performances.Burt Reynolds plays the character of Jack Horner, a porn director who feels the burden of what the future of "film" means to his genre. The awful transition from shooting on film to recording on magnetic tape. The lose of his art, as it were...and the changes in mentality to the people he works with. Walhberg adds the perfect blend of innocense and sexual bravado needed for the character. For all those individuals who have seen Burton's Planet of the Apes, pay no attention to the performance of Wahlberg in that film...rent boogie nights and see what a difference a good script can make!Julianne Moore plays the would-be mother to all, and with that comes the torment and anguish she feels, as life imitates art; and she loses all those close to her. Heather Graham is the eye-candy, but later holds her own, and steals some of the scenes from even the great Mr. Reynolds himself. Each character is multidimensional, rich with life, and performed by actors that seem to be picture perfect for the part.The film itself is often funny, tragic, exciting, and provides a uncompromising look into the turblulant lifestyle of the fast-pace 1970's. It makes no excuses, and tells no lies; and offers the audience a trip back. But even more importantly, the movie gives us a grand example of how films should be made; and a new director whose bold visions bring back art in film</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: "Eat, Pray, Love" is about a wealthy, over-privileged woman who has a mid-life crises and instead of buying a sports car, she divorces her husband, has some affairs, and spends a boat-load of money.I guess the moral of the story is that money can buy happiness.This is the type of movie that makes people want to join the "occupy" movement.

      <value>From IMDb : 3.7/5</value>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: First of all, Seven Years In Tibet is a very aesthetically pleasing film. The snowy Himalayas, the Tibetan villages, and the amazing costumes and religious ceremonies are all filmed beautifully, with rich colours and lighting. The music by John Williams is also excellent, and it's fascinating to hear how it blends with the unusual Tibetan music.It's not all surface though, there's depth here too. Don't believe the negative comments about Brad Pitt's acting. Admittedly his accent slips a bit in places, but he does a great job as Heinrich, both the unpleasant, arrogant character at the beginning, and the more gentle and wise man that he becomes as the film progresses. His relationship with the young Dalai Lama (a very impressive actor) is an unusual one and refreshingly unsentimental. The film is well edited; scenes are not drawn out any longer than they need to be. As a whole, it is fast paced but also peaceful, tender and moving. You don't get bored but you're not bombarded with pointless action scenes either.It's a pleasant surprise to see a Hollywood film where women and other cultures aren't treated as objects, and are allowed to be full, complex characters. It could be argued that this film has a Western perspective, but after all, it is adapted from a book written by a European living in Tibet, and intended for Western audiences. It treats the Tibetan culture with a great deal of respect, so I don't really see a problem with that. Similarly, those who have complained that it doesn't tell you enough about the Dalai Lama and too much about Heinrich, ultimately it is Heinrich's story, and that is its strength: that it is one man's tale, and not a political polemic. It gives you a great sense of how people's stories intersect and how the whole world is connected.Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended</review>
    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 0120102, Title: Seven Years in Tibet, Starrating: 3.7/5 
 --- Description: Directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud.  With Brad Pitt, David Thewlis, BD Wong, Mako. True story of Heinrich Harrer, an Austrian mountain climber who became friends with the Dalai Lama at the time of China's takeover of Tibet. 
 --- Director: Jean-Jacques Annaud, Heinrich Harrer, Becky Johnston, njsolicitor, Reaching the Summit of Human Conscience and Consciousness
 --- Actors: Brad Pitt (role=Heinrich Harrer), David Thewlis (role=Peter Aufschnaiter), BD Wong (role=Ngawang Jigme), Mako (role=Kungo Tsarong), Danny Denzongpa (role=Regent), Victor Wong (role=Chinese 'Amban'), Ingeborga Dapkunaite (role=Ingrid Harrer), Jamyang Jamtsho Wangchuk (role=Dalai Lama, 14 Years Old), Lhakpa Tsamchoe (role=Pema Lhaki), Jetsun Pema (role=Great Mother), Ama Ashe Dongtse (role=Tashi), Sonam Wangchuk (role=Dalai Lama, 8 Years Old)
 --- Review: First of all, Seven Years In Tibet is a very aesthetically pleasing film. The snowy Himalayas, the Tibetan villages, and the amazing costumes and religious ceremonies are all filmed beautifully, with rich colours and lighting. The music by John Williams is also excellent, and it's fascinating to hear how it blends with the unusual Tibetan music.It's not all surface though, there's depth here too. Don't believe the negative comments about Brad Pitt's acting. Admittedly his accent slips a bit in places, but he does a great job as Heinrich, both the unpleasant, arrogant character at the beginning, and the more gentle and wise man that he becomes as the film progresses. His relationship with the young Dalai Lama (a very impressive actor) is an unusual one and refreshingly unsentimental. The film is well edited; scenes are not drawn out any longer than they need to be. As a whole, it is fast paced but also peaceful, tender and moving. You don't get bored but you're not bombarded with pointless action scenes either.It's a pleasant surprise to see a Hollywood film where women and other cultures aren't treated as objects, and are allowed to be full, complex characters. It could be argued that this film has a Western perspective, but after all, it is adapted from a book written by a European living in Tibet, and intended for Western audiences. It treats the Tibetan culture with a great deal of respect, so I don't really see a problem with that. Similarly, those who have complained that it doesn't tell you enough about the Dalai Lama and too much about Heinrich, ultimately it is Heinrich's story, and that is its strength: that it is one man's tale, and not a political polemic. It gives you a great sense of how people's stories intersect and how the whole world is connected.Overall, an unusual film, very involving and emotional without sentimentality, with wonderful music and outstanding cinematography. Highly recommended

    <review type="text">IMDb review: An entertaining romantic drama by Buz Luhrmann, old-Hollywood style.The movie is set in the Northern Territory of Australia in the years previous to the involvement of Japan in the WW II, and tells the story of Sarah Ashley -an English lady who goes to Australia to try to get her husband back to England and ends becoming the head of their Australian cattle farm-, Drover -an independent free-spirited cattle and horse drover that works for her- and Nullah -a half-caste Aboriginal child who lives in the farm and struggles to live in a world in which he's alien to both blacks and whites.This is one of those movies that you can say it is done as the movies of the golden era of Hollywood used to be - flashy wonderfully well-looking movie stars, great scenery and great studio settings, detailed recreation of the era's fashion, decoration, atmosphere, etc., , and a simple epic plot with a great love story. Australia has all of this, but also a little bit of corn, a thin plot, weak characters and flaws that are even more noticeable in a super-production like this.The script is uneven and Manichean (with angels and demons) and mixes several movie genres (romantic comedy, romantic drama, war movie, western movie, and Aboriginal movie) with different degrees of success. The characters are descriptive and without emotional depth, and that affects the acting. However, I loved the depiction of the magic and wisdom of Aboriginal Australians, which is really well presented, with its magic beliefs and philosophical and environmental approach to the world. I think that part is truly genuine and real and reaches the viewer. I also loved that Lady Ashley's character is the one of a true modern woman, as she is a strong-willed free woman, a boss, the boss of her man, a woman who always leads, never submissive or afraid of being alone if she doesn't get what she wants. That's a post-modern woman, so rare to see in cinema nowadays.The acting is unconvincing on the part of the leading actors. Hugh Jackman's performance is just OK in his role, while Nicole Kidman disappoints in the comic part of the movie, as she seems not to relax when she does so, but she warms up to her usual self when the story becomes more dramatic; she looks beautiful in this movie, like a 50s movie star, although those inflated siliconed lips were a distraction... Jackman and Kidman make a great couple, but their chemistry on camera was nothing memorable and you see yourself seeing two actors playing a couple, not a real couple on screen.Most supporting actors are good in their roles, especially the Aboriginal ones, who really shine in this film. David Gulpilil is simply terrific, completely believable and inspired in his role of the Aboriginal Elder King George. Brandon Walters, despite his youth, offers a memorable performance, and his face really lights up the screen. Also great is the actor who plays Drove's Aboriginal pal, who also offers a solid performance. They are the ones who really give soul to the movie.Despite what you might expect, the cinematography is poor. I was expecting the rare beauty of the Northern Territory to be captured by the always stylish and colorful Luhrmann. However, the part of the movie that happens during the dry season is completely opaque and colorless, ugly to watch, while the scenes happening during the rainy season are again limited in colors.To my disenchantment, many of the most colorful and beautiful scenes are digitally created or enhanced, while others seem to have been shot in big studios. Just the Mission island seems to convey that luxurious real feeling of the NT vegetation. Some of the most beautiful bits of the real land, the aerial vistas, look like if they had been taken for a documentary for National Geographic. Where is the emotional connection of the story with the land? In other words, the viewer doesn't go beyond what the eyes see. So, one wonders, why the movie was called Australia and why it was sold as a movie that captured the spirit of this country. To be honest, I thought that most scenes in the movie could have been shot anywhere in the world not in Australia.The movie is a little too long. Most of the first half an hour could have been removed , condensed or presented in another way to give the non-Aboriginal characters more emotional background and depth. For example, we barely know why Neil Fletcher wants so badly Sarah's farm, and why he's so wicked in general but he loves a lovable sweet good- hearted woman. He is just an archetypal bad-guy, period.Despite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie, especially the second hour and a half, and that heaven of a man that is Hugh Jackman. God Bless him and his holy body</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I've owned this movie for a while, and only needed to see it once before deciding to run to the store to buy it. As a matter of fact, I'm watching it right now, but I got on here and looked it up because I wanted to see what other movies the writer had written (unfortunately---it's the only one.) After looking at the ratings and comments I had to voice my own opinion."The Wedding Planner" has everything you could ask from a romantic comedy. Predictability is always a factor, but come on! Do we really watch these types of movies expecting to be surprised at the ending? This film is quirky; all the actors and actresses don't miss a beat and they keep it real. No matter how many times I watch it, I still find something to laugh or smile at.I haven't yet met a MAN that likes this movie, but if you're a girl that wants something sweet, funny, entertaining, and the "romantic dream"..... in other words: a flick you watch with a pint of ice cream ( =P ) then this is the one for you.The directing is great, the dialog is entertaining, the acting is enjoyable, the movie over-all is fantastic. It's just sweet...even my mom likes it! O_OHonestly, stop judging the movie like you're some kind of almighty critic, and watch it for what it is.

This is rather dark, without charm or humor and totally ruins one of the greatest villains of Marvel comics. sure, the special effects are decent and there is potential for a somewhat good film here or there but the stereotypes and lack of an intriguing plot entirely ruin any chance of a redeeming movie experience. Very disappointing</review>

 --- Description: Directed by Josh Trank, Stephen E. Rivkin.  With Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell.

 --- Director: Josh Trank, Stephen E. Rivkin, Jeremy Slater, Simon Kinberg, Josh Trank
 --- Actors: Miles Teller (role=Reed Richards), Michael B. Jordan (role=Johnny Storm), Kate Mara (role=Sue Storm), Jamie Bell (role=Ben Grimm /), Toby Kebbell (role=Victor Von Doom /), Reg E.

 --- Review: Unfortunately for everyone involved and especially the audience, the creators of this reboot had no idea what the F4 stand for, or what their stories should be about. This is rather dark, without charm or humor and totally ruins one of the greatest villains of Marvel comics. sure, the special effects are decent and there is potential for a somewhat good film here or there but the stereotypes and lack of an intriguing plot entirely ruin any chance of a redeeming movie experience. Very disappointing
 --- Viewers reactions: Very disappointing ... Fantastic Flop ... That's all? ... Now This Is Some High Quality Crap!!!! ... fantastic four = fantastic bore</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Hook is another childhood favorite that still holds up well today. It runs a little long and there are some missteps (e.g. Julia Roberts as Tinkerbell), but it really does appeal to the child in me. And watching it as an adult has given me a whole new perspective on Peter Banning - including his shortcomings, fears and joys as a father. Plus, who doesn't love the imaginary banquet scene? This is a fun movie</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: "My Girl" is one of those small treasures that, on outward appearance, seems like something it is not. Any general synopsis of the film would lead most people (including myself) to excuse the film as a dine-a-dozen coming-of-age drama with first kisses, raging hormones, and middle school bullies. The truth is, "My Girl" has all of those elements (except for the latter; the film takes place during summertime). It isn't the most original story, and it doesn't try to be a masterpiece. Its goal is to entertain the younger viewer and to remind the older viewer of the nostalgic days of innocence and the heartbreaking first encounters with the loss of it. Summer, 1972. Vada Sultenfuss (Anna Chlumsky) is a plucky 11-year-old who spends her summer days with her best pal, Thomas J. (Macaulay Culkin, who is far better here than anything else he's ever done). She dotes on her father, Harry (Dan Aykroid), who works as an in-house mortician. Subsequently, the Sultenfuss house (a grand old Victorian, naturally) is filled with the stench of death, made only worse by Vada's grandmother (Ann Nelson) whose only way of communicating is through her sporadic breaks into popular songs from the 1940s. It's only natural that Vada is also a hypochondriac who often believes she is dying. This is, of course, the summer that Vada grows up. Signs of change first begin when a new woman shows up. Her name is Shelly De Voto (Jamie Lee Curtis), and she works as a makeup artist for the dead bodies. At first she is discouraged by the fact that her clientele are deceased, but when sees that Harry and Vada need an outlet, she gladly takes the job (`They're dead. All they have are their looks,' she cheerfully gleams.) Vada likes Shelly, but when she sees that Harry has developed a crush on her, she feels threatened. She does not want Shelley to take the place of her late mother, who died two days after Vada was born. Her only outlet is Thomas J., with whom she rides her bike to the lake and discusses all of the Big Issues (the meaning of life, love, death, which 70s TV family they'd live with.) The other momentous event of the summer is Vada developing her first crush. It isn't Thomas J. (who idolizes her), but her teacher, Mr. Bixler (Griffin Dunne). He teaches a summer writing class at the local college, and Vada enrolls. Besides being the youngest in the class, she is also the only one who hasn't been taken over by 1970s psychedelia (one day, the class takes part in a group meditation.) The strength of "My Girl" isn't its story, but its little nuances of innocent bliss. Vada willingly shows a group of glowing boys a dead body. As the ride their bikes, Vada and Thomas J. sing `The Name Game'. When writing poems `from the soul', Vada writes an ode to ice cream. The relationship between Harry and Shelly is sweet, too. Before their first date, Harry's womanizing brother points out that since Harry's last date, a sexual revolution has occurred. Of course, Shelly only desires a proper and old-fashioned gentleman, which very much complicates their first date. Well, I loved this film. As a viewer, I try to watch for inconsistencies in the performances and the script, but this film had none. Dan Aykroid and Jamie Lee Curtis bring a low-key charm to their roles. Both have their flaws, and it sometimes seems they have nothing in common. But for some inexplicable reason, they are brought together and their encounters are tactful, witty, and very real. As for Anna Chlumsky, it can only be said that this young actress sets the standard for all child performances. This is not a performance, in a traditional manner; she eludes all cutesy standards of the traditional child performance, and becomes a complex, multi-dimensional person with true needs. This little girl is extremely intelligent, and when Chlumsky delivers lines beyond her years, she doesn't do it with sarcasm or adorability, but with the oblivious nature that 11-year-olds find themselves in. The world may be changing around her, but she tries her hardest to maintain her sanity and cheerfulness. Though "My Girl" is advertised as a kid's film, and kids would probably like it, this film is for adults. It isn't always a happy film, and there is a major tragedy toward the end of the film. But rather than sentimentalize, the tragedy serves as a bridge for young Vada in between the realms of innocence and childhood and the real world of loss and sadness. And as dark as "My Girl" may sometimes be, there is always a sense of charm and warmth brought to the screen by the characters. This is a wonderful, wonderful film</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I am among those who have not read the book and I found it to be initially confusing and boring but the film picks up after Lyra is taken into Mrs. Coultier's lavish house. The pace picks up but it may seem a little too rushed. The ending was sort of continuous, requiring a sequel. I would have liked to see the second movie but unfortunately, there is a rumour that it may not happen which is quite a pity because I thought 'The Golden Compass' was going somewhere. It is not the best movie of its kind but I thought it was not so bad either. The special effects are good. The characters are lively. I loved the daemons. It's got quite a stellar cast but only Nicole Kidman gets enough screen time to be noticed. Gorgeous, glamorous and deceitful, could not picture anyone else for the part of Mrs. Coultier. (I am almost sure that the rest were promised a lengthier role in the sequels). Daniel Craig only has about 15 minutes but he makes the best of it. Sam Elliot is funny. Dakota Blue Richards is a confident young actress and she carries off Lyra well. Overall I enjoyed the world that was created in this movie and the characters. Too bad that it's left incomplete</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: What is it with this sudden surge of penguin movies appearing? Or penguins appearing in movies? I've always found watching penguins on real life TV programmes to be very entertaining because they just seem, well there's no other word for it, cute. But just recently Hollywood has seemed to start to overuse them a tiny bit. March of the Penguins I suppose really kicked it all off. I can't see what all the fuss was about that documentary and quite why it was the success it was. But it was an interesting movie. Then came along Madagascar, while admittedly not completely about penguins the penguins that did feature were undoubtedly the best things in the entire movie. Since then penguin items, TV shows and penguins on our screens have been appearing like crazy. It reached its pinnacle in my eyes last year when Happy Feet arrived on our big screens. Now I really wanted to love Happy Feet, when I first watched it I actually did adore it. But after multiple viewings I realised something, it was actually pretty boring, and way too depressing at times for my liking. Its animations was beautiful, but it just didn't live up to its potential. When the first trailers for Surf's Up arrived I didn't know what to make of it. Dancing penguins is one things, surfing penguins is just plain ludicrous. I felt like Sony were merely cashing in on this penguin phenomenon. So what a pleasant surprise to find that Surf's Up is not only a movie that'll appeal to both kids and adults, but also the best animated movie of the year so far! The fact that its a surfing penguin movie didn't make it as good as it is, no the movie succeeds for daring to try something different. A mockumentary style movie somewhat reminiscent of Creature Comforts, trust me if you like Creature Comforts you will adore this movie. The script is well written, the voice cast absolutely brilliant, hell even the animation surprised me for being very well done. If it has one fault its that its obligatory sentimental streak felt a little bit too forced for my liking. Nevertheless this is a small fault in an otherwise enjoyable and very well made animated movie.The voice cast of the movie are particularly brilliant. Shia Labeouf leads the cast as surfer wannabe Cody. Labeouf was until recently one of the few actors I could not stand to see on a screen. My past experiences with him on movies were usually films that cast him as the annoying kid. For this reason I couldn't stand him. However, then he starred in Transformers and changed my mind completely. He is actually a great actor, he can deliver a joke easily, he's easily likable and he just does everything in such a great way. This shines through again with his performance here, and because of his work in this movie I would be quite happy to see him lead another animated movie some time in the future. His character is always funny, he definitely gets some of the best lines and moments in the movie. Jeff Bridges is pretty good in his role, he works best in the funny moments of the films, when it comes to the sentimental stuff I just found his voice work to be not as good. Jon Heder almost runs off with the movie as Chicken Joe, who got the biggest laugh from the audience. Zooey Deschanel was average I suppose, her character deals more with the icky stuff towards the end than the great comedy stuff. James Woods seems to be having a great time as Reggie, he also gets some great comedy moments.The actual comedy side of Surf's Up is perhaps the movie greatest success. The mockumentary style allows us to see a different way of making animated movies. The movie of course has to switch to a more movie-ish feel at some points, its in these moments the movie isn't at its best. Whenever they're doing the documentary style the movie is as perfect as you could hope for. Meeting Cody's family at the beginning is pretty hilarious, and meeting all the other supporting characters, especially Tank who has the best scene of the movie with his trophies, is definitely the movies highlights. If you are planning to see this I highly suggest you watch the characters in the background more so than the characters in the foreground, they made me laugh all the time to see them waving at the camera or pulling faces behind the other characters backs. Chicken Joe is definitely best comically, the best scene with him involves a hot tub and the natives, its pretty hilarious, a shame most of the joke is ruined in the trailers.So what are the negatives of the movie then? Well I suppose if I look at this from a kids point of view then I realise that there are a lot of jokes that might leave the kids a bit cold. The kids will still be entertained for the majority of the movie, especially during the very cool looking surfing sequences, but some of the humour is more directly aimed at adults than anyone else. Also the sentimentality factor obviously starts to kick in towards the end. While its never sickly like a lot of other animated movies are, it still feels a tad forced. I wish for once we could have a kids movie without all the obligatory kiss and make up feel at the end of it. Why can't everyone just still hate each other or something like that? Anyway the sentimentality never makes the film bad at all, its still a great movie</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Okay so, the original was awesome, watched it when I was 6. I always thought the movie would have great potential for a sequel and it would be also just as good to be a standalone movie. I completely forgot about Surf's Up for a long time. It was only a few weeks ago that I just found out that a sequel came out months ago. I was really excited, and I didn't know what to expect! Watched online... It didn't turn out as good as I thought it would be. The story completely removes the first movies original story. Having Cody say that he was always looking up to the Hang 5, which is a group of surfers voiced by WWE stars. In the first movie, Cody always looked up to Big Z. Basically, the movie was still watchable, but it's not the sequel anyone had wanted. The story does not really coexist with the original story. I am really bummed out due to the fact that this movie was not the sequel I wanted</review>

I completely forgot about Surf's Up for a long time. It was only a few weeks ago that I just found out that a sequel came out months ago. I was really excited, and I didn't know what to expect! Watched online... It didn't turn out as good as I thought it would be. The story completely removes the first movies original story. Having Cody say that he was always looking up to the Hang 5, which is a group of surfers voiced by WWE stars. In the first movie, Cody always looked up to Big Z. Basically, the movie was still watchable, but it's not the sequel anyone had wanted. The story does not really coexist with the original story. I am really bummed out due to the fact that this movie was not the sequel I wanted
 --- Viewers reactions: This movie removes the original story from the 1st movie. ... basic straight to video sequel ... THIS IS BAD, JOHN CENA ... A pathetic attempt ... Not even that bad.</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: It's been a while since an Asterix animation film has been released in cinema's, and as a fan of the series I was very thrilled when I heard the news about a new one. But with the last two live-action movies about this crazy yellow moustached Gaul, my hopes weren't that high.Well, let me first put your minds at ease, this movie is way WAY better than the live-action flicks about asterix! It's been a while since I laughed more than 10 times with the humour in an animation film, but this one did the job exceptionally well. There is a good mixture of jokes, both for kids and adults. The story is based on comic-book nr. 17 (Le Domaine des Dieux). The story isn't very original, but is stays interesting enough and it is fast-paced, without any dull moments. However, I recommend that you know something about the world of Asterix before seeing this movie, because you get literally thrown in to the movie without any background-story. It is truly a movie for the fans of the comic books, viewers who never heard of Asterix will not always get the jokes or puns because they don't know the background-story.The visuals are stunning and the look of the characters are very recognizable without any unnecessary changes to them. It was a pleasant surprise to see Asterix, Obelix and the rest of the gang again in such a positive way, and I hope to see a sequel of the same quality soon :)! it does an great job in catching the spirit of the comics and the older animation films. I recommend it ! 8/10</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I don't usually write reviews but this was such a disappointment that I felt I had to put something. Most of the good jokes were shown in the trailers, so if you've seen the trailer then it's probably not worth the money. There were 3 of us watched this and although we all loved the despicable movies none of us enjoyed this. My son (11) said it felt like it was 2 hours long it was so boring. I can't really explain why it came across as so poor - but it just seemed really lazy and without Gru to play against the Minnions were just to simple. It was slapstick with no soul. The music although quite good didn't really seem to fit the film - just seemed to be tacked on at bit were they felt they should have a soundtrack and a famous song. Buy yourself a copy of despicable me and watch it again and again. Much better value for money!

This movie made my heart happy more than anything.I understand the movie had to tackle the dreaded "R" word and it hurt hearing the word tossed out by a child at the beginning but Zaks response was legendary and I will never forget it!It did a great job of shedding light on people with Down Syndrome and the struggles SOME go through. Unfortunately there are still people out there who don't know the joy of having a person with Down Syndrome can truly bring into they're lives.All in all an amazing movie that makes perfect sense.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I have no regrets that I watched this film. He is bright, cheerful and memorable. This is such a rarity in our time, when in a comedy melodrama there is not a single gram of vulgarity. The plot is very curious, and in general the film is made at a fairly high level. But it seemed to me that in the script and direction there are annoying flaws - the characters are outlined very schematically. This affected the game of leading actors. The characters are quite charming, but to create a full-fledged image, the actors did not have the background of their characters, which is why some of their actions look artificially and unconvincing</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: When I saw the flick today, from the very first minutes of the movie I saw people talking and acting like today's people, set into some 1930s stage. I don't know if it's just the bad acting or the bad director that made the movie so implausible to follow.The actors neither speak or act like people spoke or behaved back in the 1930s.Within the first 10 minutes the words "Nazi" and "Hitler" were uttered several times - completely omitting that, back then, the true apprehended menace was the local authorities. Back then, the politics wasn't perceived as being the result of just one single mad man. It was a huge and, back then, popular organization that was ruling the country. I haven't read the original book; probably it's written the same way, but if it does, then it's, too, not using the words that have been used back then and written from a retrospective. So to me, this flic is rather a fictional wannabe than a realistic biopic.Though I admit the film was portraying only a child's view on the situation, from my point of view it is emotionally quite vapid. All the important moments in the film that might have caused the slightest suspense or compassion were left out. Even the situation where the train conductor checks for the family name is depicted like they were just buying a pound of butter.Which brings me to mention the completely irrelevant and petty musical score. I wouldn't call the few dull notes in the movie a "score" anyway. The musical score didn't at all convey any emotion whatsoever.The depicted situations all were so nugatory staged and poorly scored, it was often utterly hard to bear. When the family left their mansion at the beginning of the movie I begged for some emotional musical score to convey the loss. But no, why bother viewers with emotion ...Then, dialogs were often spoken like being read from a text sheet. The intonation was horrible. Important words were hidden in a discharge of words. No pause was disturbing the spate.The only exception to the cast was the elder woman playing the housekeeper/nanny. She was acting marvellously, conveying emotions from every word and every micromotion. And I felt the actor depicting the son character acting quite authentic.Finally, I don't quite unterstand why French scenes were subtitled while the Swiss actors (even the children) were to talk German instead of Swiss German. The children even were dubbed. Well, as I wrote before, the flick was implausible to many regards.For everyone who wants to follow a year in a child's live bothered with some relocations but otherwise living a life everyone else lived back then, they will enjoy the movie. But for everyone else, expecting only a fraction of a quality flick like "Der Engel mit der Posaune", they will certainly be disappointed. To me this film is just a plain subsidied direct-to-video quality level production</review>

A little girl who had super natural powers, a sea captain ( her father) who was the king of a cannibal tribe, a horse who to some extent could talk, at least well enough that Pipi could umderstand him.There was also a flying motorcycle, and a flying machine that Pipi powered by twirling around with a broom.I wouldn't have enjoyed it near as much, had my grand kids not been there to ooh, ahh, and giggle, at what was taking place.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Being a lifelong fan of animation and ballet, 'Ballerina' seemed very appealing to me. Plus who doesn't love an underdog/person who wants to succeed at something they love against adversity story.While not up there with my favourite animated films, or one of my favourite films of 2016, 'Ballerina' is nonetheless charming with a lot of delights. It will delight the younger crowd, but fellow ballet fans will also be charmed and there should be enough for adults to find value. 'Ballerina' is much more than a film for "little girls" or "just for kids" and does a good job telling a type of story that would be relatable to anybody.Coming from somebody who overcame disabilities and bullying and wanted to sing professionally and get training and experience, it took a long time but I got there and have not looked back, 'Ballerina' clicked with me.Of course 'Ballerina' isn't immune to flaws. The story is very familiar and does get predictable, while the characters are very likable but slightly skim-surface archetypes. However, this may seem very nit-picky and can easily be ignored by people and only problems for the toughest of critics.Aside from these, there were also reservations with some of the soundtrack and one voice cast member. The music is often beautiful and infectious, with some genuine enchantment, but could have done with more classical music choices and less pop. A good deal of the pop tunes are very catchy, but more Tchaikovsky would have suited the film better and been more dynamic and a few others grate. Dane DeHaan doesn't sound right as Victor and doesn't fit, sounding too mature for a character clearly intended to be much younger, either he should have tried to sound younger and more boyish or the character should have been voiced by somebody in his late-teens.However, the animation is very good, often excellent, especially in the beautifully studied and meticulous background details and the intricate and graceful choreography that synchronises with the music very well and shows animators that have clearly done their homework. As said, the soundtrack does mostly work, while the script makes a real attempt to appeal to both children and adults (being a family film) and, with a nice mix of humour, pathos and life values and never being over-complicated or childish, it does succeed.The story, even with the familiarity and predictability, goes at a neat pace and as well as having a lot of charm and heart the messaging never comes over as preachy and very much valuable. It is also easy to see why anybody would find it inspiring and easy to relate to, as a young adult both were very easy for me. Even though archetypal, the characters are still likable, the title character has her flaws but it is easy to quickly warm to her. The voice acting, DeHaan aside, is strong, with Elle Fanning and Carly Rae Jensen bringing emotion and spirit to their characters and Maddie Ziegler stealing the show.In summary, a familiar film but a very charming one and one to be seen without prejudice. 7/10 Bethany Cox</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: The current (15th of August, 2018) IMDB description is absolutely wrong. The show doesn't have a character named Anastasia who's trying to save her sister from dying after drinking the blood of a dead person.It's about two half-vampire/half-human sisters who move with their parents, a vampire father and human mother, out of Transilvania to their mother's hometown in Germany. There, they attempt to live among the humans and keep it a secret that they're vampires.

 --- Review: The current (15th of August, 2018) IMDB description is absolutely wrong. The show doesn't have a character named Anastasia who's trying to save her sister from dying after drinking the blood of a dead person.It's about two half-vampire/half-human sisters who move with their parents, a vampire father and human mother, out of Transilvania to their mother's hometown in Germany. There, they attempt to live among the humans and keep it a secret that they're vampires. The two sisters try to deal with and adjust to normal human preteen/teenage life.I loved the movie, as said

We all enjoyed it immensely.It had everything it should have for a movie that was based on fantastic events. A little girl who had super natural powers, a sea captain ( her father) who was the king of a cannibal tribe, a horse who to some extent could talk, at least well enough that Pipi could umderstand him.There was also a flying motorcycle, and a flying machine that Pipi powered by twirling around with a broom.I wouldn't have enjoyed it near as much, had my grand kids not been there to ooh, ahh, and giggle, at what was taking place. It was a very enjoyable movie, and well worth spending my time watching. If you have kids to watch it with, it will be that much more enjoyable</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: One of the few more-modern animated films I still enjoy; maybe that's because it doesn't happen to revolve around "The power of friendship/love/whatever" and isn't some sappy love story, like many of Disney's drek has been (though it does have a minor, slightly sleazey love-ish story in the background). Dreamworks is a breath of fresh air in times like these, it would seem.The plot works on many levels; it's straightforward enough for the general kid to understand and enjoy, but is piled under levels of wit and more jokes that rely on understanding more of it, making it balanced and still funny the 150+th time I watch it.The songs are catchy (as can be well-expected from the good man Elton John), the characters are lovable yet total sleazeball con-men, and the humour is on many levels; and with it, it brings many good, memorable lines ("'For three days?!' 'YES! Don't even breathe!'" and "'You're buying your own con!' 'At least I'm not DATING mine!' '... oooh, low blow.'" come to mind).As a basic rundown, there's Miguel, the fun-loving, more light-hearted of the two con-men; he tends to appreciate the beauty in fun and people. Tulio, the other half of the duo, has a bit more preoccupation with material possessions and wealth, though he still remains human. Then there's Chel; the seducer from the city of gold, able to help the two (at a price). And our main antagonist? Tzekel Khan (spelling unsure), a rather nutsy high priest and speaker for the gods, who proves to be... well, a basket case.The animation pulls itself off well; the movie is bright and colourful, but not a kiddie flick at all- rather, it's humorous on all scales- my friend's 6-year-old-brother, I, and my 55-year-old dad agree. The Road to El Dorado is enjoyable on all accounts. If nothing else, consider renting it</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I realise that it may be premature to call this film overlooked, but with both Disney and DreamWorks sounding the death knell for cel animation, this film has yet to receive its due.First off, this is a gorgeous film to look at. The CG work may not be quite seamless, but this seems to be an intentional decision on the part of the directors, and it wasn't jarring in any way. The colour palette is well chosen, and the characters are well-drawn and stylised.Second, the voice performances are great. Brad Pitt has always been an underrated actor in my opinion, so his performance here was, no surprise, excellent, as were those of Joseph Fiennes, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Michelle Pfeiffer.Third, the pacing is great. This is a film that breezes by with plenty of action and a welcome lack of potty humour. There are scenes where vomit and bare bottoms are used, but not nearly to the same tasteless effect as most children's films these days.Finally, my kids loved it. They had a lot of fun, and so did my wife. This is not a crowd easily pleased by movies, so this is really saying something</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: As a loyal fan of the Back to the Future phenomenon, I long awaited a chance to publish my take on the series. It may be a bit surprising to some that I would choose to write my comments in the section specific to the last movie which has been considered to be the worst film of the trilogy.For many years, in consideration of this one trilogy which served to inspire and excite me as to possibilities of the motion picture industry, I would look with a disappointment on BTTF Part Three, believing it to be an unwelcome, unexciting film which ended the legacy.However, recently it came upon me to purchase the trilogy on VHS and re-experience it, as I had once did, though now from a more balanced perspective. I watched the first two Back to the Future movies avoided the third in the fear of being once again disappointed. Utter disappointment is no longer the feeling I can use to describe my take of the movie.Back to the Future 3 is a well-written, well-directed, well-balanced piece. With an incredible musical score, brilliant acting and excellent composition, the movie reminded me that Back to the Future was never about action. It was truly about the characters we came to know and love in the first movie. It was a return to the basics, the friendship between Marty and Doc and how each was thrown through time to change not only the future of Hill Valley, but also their own lives and their future choices.Robert Zemeckis' (the writer) decision to send the two friends back to 1885, in their final adventure, was brilliant. Imagery like the "famous Hill Valley courthouse under construction" and the "steam engine train wheeling up to the rear of the futuristic Delorean" was unforgettable. For example, the dancing at the Courthouse welcoming festivities contrasted with the action-laden scene (in BTTF2) between Griff and Marty at the same place just a century and a half later.All in all, Back to the Future Part Three was a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. To anyone who despises this film, I recommend another full watching. There are so many details which are kudos out to fans of the previous two movies. The movie successfully slowed the pace of the other two movies (in preparation for conclusion) without losing the loyalty of true fans. It captured the essence of what brought these fans to Back to the Future in the first place.If you haven't seen it, rent and enjoy :) If you have seen it and wasn't particularly pleased, I beg another viewing.L8r</review>

I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award "- winning team of Steven Spielberg" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car "DeLorean". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost "chewed every scenes" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs "The Power of Love," and "Earth Angel".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as " A Modern/Classic Masterpiece!</review>

Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs "The Power of Love," and "Earth Angel".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as " A Modern/Classic Masterpiece!

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Back to the Future Part II is an solid sequel to the first one which Back to the Future (1985) is a masterpiece. This is a fun travel science fiction comedy in the trilogy. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with Time machine Car "DeLorean" in to the future and back to the past again. This film is a 8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, like mostly viewers stated. I love "Back to the Future" trilogy it is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I grew up with this trilogy I have seen the first one on VHS as a kid. Years later I have seen the sequels on TV. I love this movie to death and it is my third favorite film in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong but I have enjoyed Back to the Future Part III more than part II and think the third film is the most underrated film in the trilogy and unappreciated. This film does have the comedy and the humor in it.I Love, Love this film so so so much, it is a great direction from Robert Zemeckis and brilliant writing from Bob Gale. Back to the Future Part II was nominated for an Oscar. I really did missed 21st October 2015 an important event date from this film in the trilogy that reached 30 year anniversary in the year 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray. Back to the Future Part II (1989)The story continues when Doctor Emmett Brown, Marty McFly and Jennifer traveling in to the future 2015 to fix Marty's and Jennifer's future in which Marty has to save his son from been jailed. His arch enemy Biff Tannen steals Marty's idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past November 12, 1955 to change the alternative time line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline in the year 1985. The same alternative timeline and paradox was also used in The Flash Season 3 Episode 1 Flashpoint. Than the story sets Marty and Doc on the hunt for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the year 1955 in which Biff is a teenager. The chase and a race on the road in which Marty is in Biff's car try's to get the Almanac back and Biff crashes with his car in the truck of manure is my favorite scene in the film. The Hoverboard scene in the future in which Griff chases Marty in the year 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Griff and his gang lands in the court in the opening scene is also my favorite scene in the film.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent in their performances. Michael J. Fox plays more than just one character, he even played Marlene McFly future daughter of Marty.Things I really didn't like about the film and that is why it hurts the film: the dark future created I didn't liked. I hated Thomas F. Wilson's character Biff trough in tier film he was irritating awful person. I didn't like the death of George McFly. I didn't like Biff marrying Loraine. Half of the film was more focusing on Biff than Doc and Marty I hated that idea. I did not like the filmmakers repeat the first movie again in the year 1955. They copied the first film I did not like that idea so sorry. I still hate Biff Tannen in this movie so damn much! I did not like the ending in which Doc was hit by a lightning with "DeLorean" and sent back 100 year in the past. The film didn't had a satisfying ending or a happy ending that we wished for. I didn't like older Marty McFly he acted like he is stupid in the movie that is why I prefer III over this film more. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover did not return to reprise their roles. I am surprised that actress Elisabeth Shue accept the role of Jennifer but she declined the role for The Karate Kid Part II weird. This film get's 8 "Back to the Future" is my favorite trilogy of all time and I love this movie to death. I hope they don't make Part IV because it will be disaster. It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss movies like this they don't make em' like this anymore</review>

It may be a bit surprising to some that I would choose to write my comments in the section specific to the last movie which has been considered to be the worst film of the trilogy.For many years, in consideration of this one trilogy which served to inspire and excite me as to possibilities of the motion picture industry, I would look with a disappointment on BTTF Part Three, believing it to be an unwelcome, unexciting film which ended the legacy.However, recently it came upon me to purchase the trilogy on VHS and re-experience it, as I had once did, though now from a more balanced perspective. I watched the first two Back to the Future movies avoided the third in the fear of being once again disappointed. Utter disappointment is no longer the feeling I can use to describe my take of the movie.Back to the Future 3 is a well-written, well-directed, well-balanced piece. With an incredible musical score, brilliant acting and excellent composition, the movie reminded me that Back to the Future was never about action. It was truly about the characters we came to know and love in the first movie. It was a return to the basics, the friendship between Marty and Doc and how each was thrown through time to change not only the future of Hill Valley, but also their own lives and their future choices.Robert Zemeckis' (the writer) decision to send the two friends back to 1885, in their final adventure, was brilliant. Imagery like the "famous Hill Valley courthouse under construction" and the "steam engine train wheeling up to the rear of the futuristic Delorean" was unforgettable. For example, the dancing at the Courthouse welcoming festivities contrasted with the action-laden scene (in BTTF2) between Griff and Marty at the same place just a century and a half later.All in all, Back to the Future Part Three was a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. To anyone who despises this film, I recommend another full watching. There are so many details which are kudos out to fans of the previous two movies. The movie successfully slowed the pace of the other two movies (in preparation for conclusion) without losing the loyalty of true fans. It captured the essence of what brought these fans to Back to the Future in the first place.If you haven't seen it, rent and enjoy :) If you have seen it and wasn't particularly pleased, I beg another viewing.L8r</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award "- winning team of Steven Spielberg" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car "DeLorean". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost "chewed every scenes" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs "The Power of Love," and "Earth Angel".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as " A Modern/Classic Masterpiece!</review>

Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award "- winning team of Steven Spielberg" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car "DeLorean". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost "chewed every scenes" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs "The Power of Love," and "Earth Angel".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as " A Modern/Classic Masterpiece!

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Back to the Future Part II is an solid sequel to the first one which Back to the Future (1985) is a masterpiece. This is a fun travel science fiction comedy in the trilogy. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with Time machine Car "DeLorean" in to the future and back to the past again. This film is a 8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, like mostly viewers stated. I love "Back to the Future" trilogy it is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I grew up with this trilogy I have seen the first one on VHS as a kid. Years later I have seen the sequels on TV. I love this movie to death and it is my third favorite film in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong but I have enjoyed Back to the Future Part III more than part II and think the third film is the most underrated film in the trilogy and unappreciated. This film does have the comedy and the humor in it.I Love, Love this film so so so much, it is a great direction from Robert Zemeckis and brilliant writing from Bob Gale. Back to the Future Part II was nominated for an Oscar. I really did missed 21st October 2015 an important event date from this film in the trilogy that reached 30 year anniversary in the year 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray. Back to the Future Part II (1989)The story continues when Doctor Emmett Brown, Marty McFly and Jennifer traveling in to the future 2015 to fix Marty's and Jennifer's future in which Marty has to save his son from been jailed. His arch enemy Biff Tannen steals Marty's idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past November 12, 1955 to change the alternative time line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline in the year 1985. The same alternative timeline and paradox was also used in The Flash Season 3 Episode 1 Flashpoint. Than the story sets Marty and Doc on the hunt for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the year 1955 in which Biff is a teenager. The chase and a race on the road in which Marty is in Biff's car try's to get the Almanac back and Biff crashes with his car in the truck of manure is my favorite scene in the film. The Hoverboard scene in the future in which Griff chases Marty in the year 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Griff and his gang lands in the court in the opening scene is also my favorite scene in the film.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent in their performances. Michael J. Fox plays more than just one character, he even played Marlene McFly future daughter of Marty.Things I really didn't like about the film and that is why it hurts the film: the dark future created I didn't liked. I hated Thomas F. Wilson's character Biff trough in tier film he was irritating awful person. I didn't like the death of George McFly. I didn't like Biff marrying Loraine. Half of the film was more focusing on Biff than Doc and Marty I hated that idea. I did not like the filmmakers repeat the first movie again in the year 1955. They copied the first film I did not like that idea so sorry. I still hate Biff Tannen in this movie so damn much! I did not like the ending in which Doc was hit by a lightning with "DeLorean" and sent back 100 year in the past. The film didn't had a satisfying ending or a happy ending that we wished for. I didn't like older Marty McFly he acted like he is stupid in the movie that is why I prefer III over this film more. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover did not return to reprise their roles. I am surprised that actress Elisabeth Shue accept the role of Jennifer but she declined the role for The Karate Kid Part II weird. This film get's 8 "Back to the Future" is my favorite trilogy of all time and I love this movie to death. I hope they don't make Part IV because it will be disaster. It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss movies like this they don't make em' like this anymore</review>

It may be a bit surprising to some that I would choose to write my comments in the section specific to the last movie which has been considered to be the worst film of the trilogy.For many years, in consideration of this one trilogy which served to inspire and excite me as to possibilities of the motion picture industry, I would look with a disappointment on BTTF Part Three, believing it to be an unwelcome, unexciting film which ended the legacy.However, recently it came upon me to purchase the trilogy on VHS and re-experience it, as I had once did, though now from a more balanced perspective. I watched the first two Back to the Future movies avoided the third in the fear of being once again disappointed. Utter disappointment is no longer the feeling I can use to describe my take of the movie.Back to the Future 3 is a well-written, well-directed, well-balanced piece. With an incredible musical score, brilliant acting and excellent composition, the movie reminded me that Back to the Future was never about action. It was truly about the characters we came to know and love in the first movie. It was a return to the basics, the friendship between Marty and Doc and how each was thrown through time to change not only the future of Hill Valley, but also their own lives and their future choices.Robert Zemeckis' (the writer) decision to send the two friends back to 1885, in their final adventure, was brilliant. Imagery like the "famous Hill Valley courthouse under construction" and the "steam engine train wheeling up to the rear of the futuristic Delorean" was unforgettable. For example, the dancing at the Courthouse welcoming festivities contrasted with the action-laden scene (in BTTF2) between Griff and Marty at the same place just a century and a half later.All in all, Back to the Future Part Three was a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. To anyone who despises this film, I recommend another full watching. There are so many details which are kudos out to fans of the previous two movies. The movie successfully slowed the pace of the other two movies (in preparation for conclusion) without losing the loyalty of true fans. It captured the essence of what brought these fans to Back to the Future in the first place.If you haven't seen it, rent and enjoy :) If you have seen it and wasn't particularly pleased, I beg another viewing.L8r</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award "- winning team of Steven Spielberg" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car "DeLorean". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost "chewed every scenes" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs "The Power of Love," and "Earth Angel".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time.

 --- Review: What can I say about this movie that was already said? It is my favorite time travel sci-fi, adventure epic comedy in the 80's and I love this movie to death! When I saw this movie I was thrown out by its theme. An excellent sci-fi, adventure epic, I LOVE the 80s. It's simple the greatest time travel movie ever happened in the history of world cinema. I love this movie to death, I love, LOVE, love it! I firstly saw this movie in the early 90's as a kid on VHS tape and I was blow away by the action and the score and the title back to the future. This movie is one of the best masterpiece time travel epic adventure film. Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are fantastic at acting. Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award "- winning team of Steven Spielberg" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car "DeLorean". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost "chewed every scenes" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Back to the Future Part II is an solid sequel to the first one which Back to the Future (1985) is a masterpiece. This is a fun travel science fiction comedy in the trilogy. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with Time machine Car "DeLorean" in to the future and back to the past again. This film is a 8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, like mostly viewers stated. I love "Back to the Future" trilogy it is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I grew up with this trilogy I have seen the first one on VHS as a kid. Years later I have seen the sequels on TV. I love this movie to death and it is my third favorite film in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong but I have enjoyed Back to the Future Part III more than part II and think the third film is the most underrated film in the trilogy and unappreciated. This film does have the comedy and the humor in it.I Love, Love this film so so so much, it is a great direction from Robert Zemeckis and brilliant writing from Bob Gale. Back to the Future Part II was nominated for an Oscar. I really did missed 21st October 2015 an important event date from this film in the trilogy that reached 30 year anniversary in the year 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray. Back to the Future Part II (1989)The story continues when Doctor Emmett Brown, Marty McFly and Jennifer traveling in to the future 2015 to fix Marty's and Jennifer's future in which Marty has to save his son from been jailed. His arch enemy Biff Tannen steals Marty's idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past November 12, 1955 to change the alternative time line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline in the year 1985. The same alternative timeline and paradox was also used in The Flash Season 3 Episode 1 Flashpoint. Than the story sets Marty and Doc on the hunt for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the year 1955 in which Biff is a teenager. The chase and a race on the road in which Marty is in Biff's car try's to get the Almanac back and Biff crashes with his car in the truck of manure is my favorite scene in the film. The Hoverboard scene in the future in which Griff chases Marty in the year 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Griff and his gang lands in the court in the opening scene is also my favorite scene in the film.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent in their performances. Michael J. Fox plays more than just one character, he even played Marlene McFly future daughter of Marty.Things I really didn't like about the film and that is why it hurts the film: the dark future created I didn't liked. I hated Thomas F. Wilson's character Biff trough in tier film he was irritating awful person. I didn't like the death of George McFly. I didn't like Biff marrying Loraine. Half of the film was more focusing on Biff than Doc and Marty I hated that idea. I did not like the filmmakers repeat the first movie again in the year 1955. They copied the first film I did not like that idea so sorry. I still hate Biff Tannen in this movie so damn much! I did not like the ending in which Doc was hit by a lightning with "DeLorean" and sent back 100 year in the past. The film didn't had a satisfying ending or a happy ending that we wished for. I didn't like older Marty McFly he acted like he is stupid in the movie that is why I prefer III over this film more. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover did not return to reprise their roles. I am surprised that actress Elisabeth Shue accept the role of Jennifer but she declined the role for The Karate Kid Part II weird. This film get's 8 "Back to the Future" is my favorite trilogy of all time and I love this movie to death. I hope they don't make Part IV because it will be disaster. It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss movies like this they don't make em' like this anymore</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: As a loyal fan of the Back to the Future phenomenon, I long awaited a chance to publish my take on the series. It may be a bit surprising to some that I would choose to write my comments in the section specific to the last movie which has been considered to be the worst film of the trilogy.For many years, in consideration of this one trilogy which served to inspire and excite me as to possibilities of the motion picture industry, I would look with a disappointment on BTTF Part Three, believing it to be an unwelcome, unexciting film which ended the legacy.However, recently it came upon me to purchase the trilogy on VHS and re-experience it, as I had once did, though now from a more balanced perspective. I watched the first two Back to the Future movies avoided the third in the fear of being once again disappointed. Utter disappointment is no longer the feeling I can use to describe my take of the movie.Back to the Future 3 is a well-written, well-directed, well-balanced piece. With an incredible musical score, brilliant acting and excellent composition, the movie reminded me that Back to the Future was never about action. It was truly about the characters we came to know and love in the first movie. It was a return to the basics, the friendship between Marty and Doc and how each was thrown through time to change not only the future of Hill Valley, but also their own lives and their future choices.Robert Zemeckis' (the writer) decision to send the two friends back to 1885, in their final adventure, was brilliant. Imagery like the "famous Hill Valley courthouse under construction" and the "steam engine train wheeling up to the rear of the futuristic Delorean" was unforgettable. For example, the dancing at the Courthouse welcoming festivities contrasted with the action-laden scene (in BTTF2) between Griff and Marty at the same place just a century and a half later.All in all, Back to the Future Part Three was a perfect ending to a perfect trilogy. To anyone who despises this film, I recommend another full watching. There are so many details which are kudos out to fans of the previous two movies. The movie successfully slowed the pace of the other two movies (in preparation for conclusion) without losing the loyalty of true fans. It captured the essence of what brought these fans to Back to the Future in the first place.If you haven't seen it, rent and enjoy :) If you have seen it and wasn't particularly pleased, I beg another viewing.L8r</review>

Music theme score by Alan Silvestri is excellent I could listen to it whole day.Back to the Future (1985) From the Academy Award "- winning team of Steven Spielberg" and Robert Zemeckis** comes the hilariously groundbreaking adventure that thrilled critics and audiences alike - and sparked one of the most successful movie trilogy ever! Directed by Robert Zemeckis the movie begins with Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) a teenager who has a really messed up family. His ultimate goal was to become a rock star which was heartened by his girl friend Jennifer Parker (Claudia Wells). But things went wrong when scientist Dr. Emmett Brown/Doc (Christopher Lloyd) wanted Marty's assistance for his new invention.At that night Marty went to assist Doc's invention the Time traveling Car "DeLorean". Marty was told to record Doc's first time travel to the future. At that instant they were attacked by some Libyan terrorists who were cheated by Doc for Plutonium.After killing Doc they turn towards to Marty and without any intention Marty enters the Time Traveling car. But it was previously set by Doc and when activated Marty gets transfer to 1955 from 1985.What will he do next, will he can come back to the future, or will he stuck back in the past for his rest of the life. More than that will his time travel make serious effects on the future? Dealing with time travel and time paradox Steven Spielberg presents this amazing journey of Marty set up in the time of 80's and 50's. Scripted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale for the story of Bob Gale himself, tells a science fiction adventure in a family oriented tone.They really work hard to sculpt that sci-fi thread into a thrilling, culture clashed family movie. A good story with a great script. Also the soul of the movie was given by the legend Alan Silvestri. His composition was all memorable especially in the chasing and emotional scenes. Over the top the theme music, it was the most dazzling and recognizable themes in the movie history.More than that the casting was simply brilliant, each and every actor is born to play their respected roles in this movie. Michael J. Fox was the only actor who can play the role of energetic Marty McFly, which was considered for numerous actors. Also Thomas F. Wilson was brilliant in his performance as the Bad boy Biff Tannen. Lea Thompson did a great work in portraying Lorraine Baines's two different life times, as a teenage girl and a matured mother. Well the extra talented Christopher Lloyd had almost "chewed every scenes" in the movie. Mr. Lloyd's versatile performance as the madman and genius scientist Dr. Emmett Brown is one of the great memorable roles in his carrier.Last but not the least, it was Crispin Glover who steal the show as the nerdy teenager/father as George McFly. It was an interesting portrayal as a boy who was transformed to a man. Crispin Glover lived in that part. I don't know whether the movie would be a masterpiece without his unique performance. Above all I want to remember this as a romantic movie and it couldn't be made without the songs "The Power of Love," and "Earth Angel".The rating I am giving is 10/10 the original and the best one of all time. I love this film, it is my favorite time travel movie of all time and I love it to death! All in all it is the greatest sci-fi, romantic movie of all time. It is the part of the great Movie History, which consider itself as " A Modern/Classic Masterpiece!</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Back to the Future Part II is an solid sequel to the first one which Back to the Future (1985) is a masterpiece. This is a fun travel science fiction comedy in the trilogy. It deals with paradox past traveling. From traveling with Time machine Car "DeLorean" in to the future and back to the past again. This film is a 8 in my opinion it doesn't deserve the hate, like mostly viewers stated. I love "Back to the Future" trilogy it is one of my all time favorite trilogy's of all time. I grew up with this trilogy I have seen the first one on VHS as a kid. Years later I have seen the sequels on TV. I love this movie to death and it is my third favorite film in the trilogy. Don't get me wrong but I have enjoyed Back to the Future Part III more than part II and think the third film is the most underrated film in the trilogy and unappreciated. This film does have the comedy and the humor in it.I Love, Love this film so so so much, it is a great direction from Robert Zemeckis and brilliant writing from Bob Gale. Back to the Future Part II was nominated for an Oscar. I really did missed 21st October 2015 an important event date from this film in the trilogy that reached 30 year anniversary in the year 2015 when the trilogy come out respectfully on a Blu-ray. Back to the Future Part II (1989)The story continues when Doctor Emmett Brown, Marty McFly and Jennifer traveling in to the future 2015 to fix Marty's and Jennifer's future in which Marty has to save his son from been jailed. His arch enemy Biff Tannen steals Marty's idea and steal's Gray's Sports Almanac only to travel back in to the past November 12, 1955 to change the alternative time line paradox in which Biff creates the timeline in the year 1985. The same alternative timeline and paradox was also used in The Flash Season 3 Episode 1 Flashpoint. Than the story sets Marty and Doc on the hunt for a Gray's Sports almanac from Biff in the year 1955 in which Biff is a teenager. The chase and a race on the road in which Marty is in Biff's car try's to get the Almanac back and Biff crashes with his car in the truck of manure is my favorite scene in the film. The Hoverboard scene in the future in which Griff chases Marty in the year 2015 and Marty outsmart them in which Griff and his gang lands in the court in the opening scene is also my favorite scene in the film.Michael J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd are excellent in their performances. Michael J. Fox plays more than just one character, he even played Marlene McFly future daughter of Marty.Things I really didn't like about the film and that is why it hurts the film: the dark future created I didn't liked. I hated Thomas F. Wilson's character Biff trough in tier film he was irritating awful person. I didn't like the death of George McFly. I didn't like Biff marrying Loraine. Half of the film was more focusing on Biff than Doc and Marty I hated that idea. I did not like the filmmakers repeat the first movie again in the year 1955. They copied the first film I did not like that idea so sorry. I still hate Biff Tannen in this movie so damn much! I did not like the ending in which Doc was hit by a lightning with "DeLorean" and sent back 100 year in the past. The film didn't had a satisfying ending or a happy ending that we wished for. I didn't like older Marty McFly he acted like he is stupid in the movie that is why I prefer III over this film more. Claudia Wells and Crispin Glover did not return to reprise their roles. I am surprised that actress Elisabeth Shue accept the role of Jennifer but she declined the role for The Karate Kid Part II weird. This film get's 8 "Back to the Future" is my favorite trilogy of all time and I love this movie to death. I hope they don't make Part IV because it will be disaster. It is rated PG for language throughout, some suggestive content and violence. I miss movies like this they don't make em' like this anymore</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: The Lodge has been a rather divisive point between critics and audiences, audiences have been more split on the film while critics have been more inclined to view the film favorably. This is not a movie made for a mass horror audience like the films made by Blumhouse or Atomic Monster, rather this is a character study with a no holds barred approach to its themes of lingering trauma and toxic religiosity. The film follows Aiden(Jaeden Martell) and Mia(Lia McHugh) who after the suicide of their mother Laura(Alicia Silverstone) live with their father Richard(Richard Armitage) and soon to be stepmother Grace (Riley Keough). Richard, needing to work through the holiday season arranges for the two to spend time with Grace at lodge in the woods that they frequent in the hopes that they will bond, but once there strange happenings coupled with the lingering resentment and bitterness felt by Aiden and Mia towards Grace for their mother's suicide a slow decent into terror begins.The Lodge as horror film is very effective at building its mood and atmosphere. The titular lodge becomes a character itself with its empty halls, surrounding frozen landscapes, and generally sense of foreboding created by its minimal lighting and cavernous nature. Be it in the dark of the night or the light of day there is never any sense of comfort felt while in the lodge and a general feeling of unease permeates the film.The characters aren't written with much in the way of depth, but they do effectively convey the feelings we expect given the circumstances. The crushing despair felt during the opening act's funeral, the mixture of boredom, restlessness, and unease felt during the second act, and finally the sheer terror and resignation that serves as the penultimate lead up to the films final moments. It's a movie where the minimalism is put to good use because it respects its audience enough not to through in a jump scare every few minutes.The overall narrative deals with heavy themes of grief and religion as the two kids, Aiden and Mia, are devout Catholics as raised by their deceased mother Laura. Grace herself has distanced herself from religion later in life as her involvement with a extremist Christian cult left her with lingering trauma that serves as another point of contention between herself and the children. A key point in which the religious themes come into play is because the children are Catholic they believe their mothers soul will never be able to find peace.The Lodge uses its themes of religiosity sparingly, and it's not so much of an indictment of religion itself, but more of the followers of said religions who twist what was once a well meaning doctrine into justification for acts of ugliness and barbarism that while not as explicitly graphic as your average Saw or Hostel film leave a haunting emptiness once we bear witness to the proceedings.With that said however this movie will not be to everyone's taste. The movie is a slow burn with long stretches broken up by the occasional nightmare or sudden noise and there's very little dialogue among the characters so the audience will need to actively look for character in subtle interactions rather than through conversation. The films use of religious iconography may also seem insulting to some who feel themselves to be among the faithful but with that said I don't believe this film to carry any ill will towards the majority of Christians and it's more about those who twist the doctrine as justification for heinous actions.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 7347846, Title: The Lodge, Starrating: 2.4/5 
 --- Description: Directed by Severin Fiala, Veronika Franz.  With Riley Keough, Jaeden Martell, Lia McHugh, Richard Armitage. A soon-to-be stepmom is snowed in with her fiancé's two children at a remote holiday village. Just as relations begin to thaw between the trio, some strange and frightening events take place. 
 --- Director: Severin Fiala, Veronika Franz, Sergio Casci, Veronika Franz, Severin Fiala
 --- Actors: Riley Keough (role=Grace), Jaeden Martell (role=Aiden Hall), Lia McHugh (role=Mia Hall), Richard Armitage (role=Richard Hall), Alicia Silverstone (role=Laura Hall), Danny Keough (role=Aaron Marshall), Lola Reid (role=Young Grace), Philippe Ménard (role=Boy), Jarred Atkin (role=Priest at Funeral), Wally the Dog (role=Grady the Dog), Anzor Alem (role=Aaro)
 --- Review: The Lodge has been a rather divisive point between critics and audiences, audiences have been more split on the film while critics have been more inclined to view the film favorably. This is not a movie made for a mass horror audience like the films made by Blumhouse or Atomic Monster, rather this is a character study with a no holds barred approach to its themes of lingering trauma and toxic religiosity. The film follows Aiden(Jaeden Martell) and Mia(Lia McHugh) who after the suicide of their mother Laura(Alicia Silverstone) live with their father Richard(Richard Armitage) and soon to be stepmother Grace (Riley Keough). Richard, needing to work through the holiday season arranges for the two to spend time with Grace at lodge in the woods that they frequent in the hopes that they will bond, but once there strange happenings coupled with the lingering resentment and bitterness felt by Aiden and Mia towards Grace for their mother's suicide a slow decent into terror begins.The Lodge as horror film is very effective at building its mood and atmosphere. The titular lodge becomes a character itself with its empty halls, surrounding frozen landscapes, and generally sense of foreboding created by its minimal lighting and cavernous nature. Be it in the dark of the night or the light of day there is never any sense of comfort felt while in the lodge and a general feeling of unease permeates the film.The characters aren't written with much in the way of depth, but they do effectively convey the feelings we expect given the circumstances. The crushing despair felt during the opening act's funeral, the mixture of boredom, restlessness, and unease felt during the second act, and finally the sheer terror and resignation that serves as the penultimate lead up to the films final moments. It's a movie where the minimalism is put to good use because it respects its audience enough not to through in a jump scare every few minutes.The overall narrative deals with heavy themes of grief and religion as the two kids, Aiden and Mia, are devout Catholics as raised by their deceased mother Laura. Grace herself has distanced herself from religion later in life as her involvement with a extremist Christian cult left her with lingering trauma that serves as another point of contention between herself and the children. A key point in which the religious themes come into play is because the children are Catholic they believe their mothers soul will never be able to find peace.The Lodge uses its themes of religiosity sparingly, and it's not so much of an indictment of religion itself, but more of the followers of said religions who twist what was once a well meaning doctrine into justification for acts of ugliness and barbarism that while not as explicitly graphic as your average Saw or Hostel film leave a haunting emptiness once we bear witness to the proceedings.With that said however this movie will not be to everyone's taste. The movie is a slow burn with long stretches broken up by the occasional nightmare or sudden noise and there's very little dialogue among the characters so the audience will need to actively look for character in subtle interactions rather than through conversation. The films use of religious iconography may also seem insulting to some who feel themselves to be among the faithful but with that said I don't believe this film to carry any ill will towards the majority of Christians and it's more about those who twist the doctrine as justification for heinous actions. However the ending may leave some wondering where the film stands given where we eventually end up, but it does make a good topic of conversation for people to explore their differing views.The Lodge is an effectively unsettling slow burn horror film that uses its minimalist aesthetics economically and effectively. From its effective performances to its barren landscapes and claustrophobic cinematography it'll leave viewers in a state of unease that makes them feel as though they're stuck in the titular lodge along side the characters
 --- Viewers reactions: It won't be for everyone, but The Lodge is an effective exercise in slow descending isolation and insanity ... In all honesty ... Textbook style over substance case. ... cold, atmospheric and terrifying ... Horror "fans" are very fussy apparently</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Bille August's "Smilla's Sense of Snow" starts off with great promise. An opening sequence that's a terrific hook segues into an introduction of the character of Smilla Jasperson, played perfectly by the lovely Julia Ormond. Smilla is self-isolated, deeply unhappy, and unapproachable. Her only real friend is the young Inuit boy, Isaiah, who dies suddenly under suspicious circumstances, and Smilla determines to uncover the reasons for his death. For the first two reels, this film is a terrific mystery story with good pacing, fine acting, and evocative cinematography. Characters with uncertain motives come and go as the story unfolds, most played by a fine stable of talented actors. But then in the third reel, the film collapses. I'm not talking about a slow descent into mediocrity here; I'm talking about a precipitous nosedive. Out of the blue, the story suddenly switches to an action/thriller format that is poorly written, directed, and edited. New, undeveloped characters are suddenly thrown into the mix, each a deus ex machina as the increasingly unrealistic plot requires. The film's denouement, in which the underlying mystery is revealed, is so scientifically ridiculous both in terms of biology and especially in physics that I felt thoroughly cheated. It's as if the entire enterprise were rushed to completion due to a looming shortage of time, money, and interest. What a pity. Even so, the first two thirds of the film stand up well on their own, and my rating is based on that. Rating: 7/10</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: A former pro-hockey player must fend for himself after becoming stranded on a mountainJosh Hartnett may be the George Raft of this generation, known by the roles turned down. More than ten years since he passed up opportunities to play Spiderman, Batman, and Superman, Hartnett is Eric LeMarque.A former pro hockey player, LeMarque has struggled with retirement and is facing a drugs charge when he goes up the mountain with his snowboard. A reckless decision to take an unsupervised course during a storm leaves LeMarque stranded and exposed to the elements.A lasting problem of 6 Below is how rote the plot is; there is not a single moment in the film that comes as a real surprise. The film's subtitle Miracle on the Mountain belies the fact that this is not to be a tragedy, and that we the audience are going through the motions of Josh Hartnett feeling cold for ninety minutes.Director Scott Waugh makes heavy use of GoPros and drones for filming snowboarding shots, yet however he captures the shots there is rarely an inventiveness on screen. The persistent whiteness of the mountain over-saturates the eyes, and the constant choral drowns the ears.This is a shame as Waugh uses his experience with stuntwork and directing Need For Speed to assemble a number of the set pieces with aplomb. Most notably this includes helicopter search and rescue sequences in which Sarah (Sarah Dumont) at base camp comes tantalisingly close to finding LeMarque.There are a few points of immersion in the story, notably a moment that ignited my own greatest fears when LeMarque falls through ice. Yet as a character LeMarque doesn't confront his situation with any particular imagination. He's never forced into the horrifying self-sacrifice of Aron Ralston (James Franco) in 127 Hours, and nor does the film have the terrifying resourcefulness and consuming morbidity of Touching the Void. LeMarque suffers because he has to, in a manner often no more engaging than a rat on a sinking ship.If the bulk of the mountainside action is taking a blue square route, this is an improvement on the flashbacks dotted throughout the film. As with the mountainside, its all filmed flatly, both visually and thematically.The domineering father and long-suffering mother are familiar tropes, and how this relationship might evolve as LeMarque grows up isn't explored. In the drive to tell an all- American tale of redemption 6 Below also leaves out interesting tidbits, such as the real life LeMarque using his dual citizenship to represent France in the '94 Olympics. A point of connection as LeMarque wastes away on the mountain should be mother Susan (Mira Sorvino) who clearly loves him very much, but she has come across as so soppy and one-dimensional it's hard to avoid a vague irritation with her. I was more interested by Sarah and the mountain operation, and would hope to see Dumont in expanded roles in the future.If you're a lover of inspirational memes or fancy the idea of Josh Hartnett nibbling bits of himself, this film is for you. Otherwise 6 Below will provide you with very little sustenance.christophermarchant.wordpress.com @BrianInvincible</review>

A reckless decision to take an unsupervised course during a storm leaves LeMarque stranded and exposed to the elements.A lasting problem of 6 Below is how rote the plot is; there is not a single moment in the film that comes as a real surprise. The film's subtitle Miracle on the Mountain belies the fact that this is not to be a tragedy, and that we the audience are going through the motions of Josh Hartnett feeling cold for ninety minutes.Director Scott Waugh makes heavy use of GoPros and drones for filming snowboarding shots, yet however he captures the shots there is rarely an inventiveness on screen. The persistent whiteness of the mountain over-saturates the eyes, and the constant choral drowns the ears.This is a shame as Waugh uses his experience with stuntwork and directing Need For Speed to assemble a number of the set pieces with aplomb. Most notably this includes helicopter search and rescue sequences in which Sarah (Sarah Dumont) at base camp comes tantalisingly close to finding LeMarque.There are a few points of immersion in the story, notably a moment that ignited my own greatest fears when LeMarque falls through ice. Yet as a character LeMarque doesn't confront his situation with any particular imagination. He's never forced into the horrifying self-sacrifice of Aron Ralston (James Franco) in 127 Hours, and nor does the film have the terrifying resourcefulness and consuming morbidity of Touching the Void. LeMarque suffers because he has to, in a manner often no more engaging than a rat on a sinking ship.If the bulk of the mountainside action is taking a blue square route, this is an improvement on the flashbacks dotted throughout the film. As with the mountainside, its all filmed flatly, both visually and thematically.The domineering father and long-suffering mother are familiar tropes, and how this relationship might evolve as LeMarque grows up isn't explored. In the drive to tell an all- American tale of redemption 6 Below also leaves out interesting tidbits, such as the real life LeMarque using his dual citizenship to represent France in the '94 Olympics. A point of connection as LeMarque wastes away on the mountain should be mother Susan (Mira Sorvino) who clearly loves him very much, but she has come across as so soppy and one-dimensional it's hard to avoid a vague irritation with her. I was more interested by Sarah and the mountain operation, and would hope to see Dumont in expanded roles in the future.If you're a lover of inspirational memes or fancy the idea of Josh Hartnett nibbling bits of himself, this film is for you. Otherwise 6 Below will provide you with very little sustenance.christophermarchant.wordpress.com @BrianInvincible

    <review type="text">IMDb review: The Lodge has been a rather divisive point between critics and audiences, audiences have been more split on the film while critics have been more inclined to view the film favorably. This is not a movie made for a mass horror audience like the films made by Blumhouse or Atomic Monster, rather this is a character study with a no holds barred approach to its themes of lingering trauma and toxic religiosity. The film follows Aiden(Jaeden Martell) and Mia(Lia McHugh) who after the suicide of their mother Laura(Alicia Silverstone) live with their father Richard(Richard Armitage) and soon to be stepmother Grace (Riley Keough). Richard, needing to work through the holiday season arranges for the two to spend time with Grace at lodge in the woods that they frequent in the hopes that they will bond, but once there strange happenings coupled with the lingering resentment and bitterness felt by Aiden and Mia towards Grace for their mother's suicide a slow decent into terror begins.The Lodge as horror film is very effective at building its mood and atmosphere. The titular lodge becomes a character itself with its empty halls, surrounding frozen landscapes, and generally sense of foreboding created by its minimal lighting and cavernous nature. Be it in the dark of the night or the light of day there is never any sense of comfort felt while in the lodge and a general feeling of unease permeates the film.The characters aren't written with much in the way of depth, but they do effectively convey the feelings we expect given the circumstances. The crushing despair felt during the opening act's funeral, the mixture of boredom, restlessness, and unease felt during the second act, and finally the sheer terror and resignation that serves as the penultimate lead up to the films final moments. It's a movie where the minimalism is put to good use because it respects its audience enough not to through in a jump scare every few minutes.The overall narrative deals with heavy themes of grief and religion as the two kids, Aiden and Mia, are devout Catholics as raised by their deceased mother Laura. Grace herself has distanced herself from religion later in life as her involvement with a extremist Christian cult left her with lingering trauma that serves as another point of contention between herself and the children. A key point in which the religious themes come into play is because the children are Catholic they believe their mothers soul will never be able to find peace.The Lodge uses its themes of religiosity sparingly, and it's not so much of an indictment of religion itself, but more of the followers of said religions who twist what was once a well meaning doctrine into justification for acts of ugliness and barbarism that while not as explicitly graphic as your average Saw or Hostel film leave a haunting emptiness once we bear witness to the proceedings.With that said however this movie will not be to everyone's taste. The movie is a slow burn with long stretches broken up by the occasional nightmare or sudden noise and there's very little dialogue among the characters so the audience will need to actively look for character in subtle interactions rather than through conversation. The films use of religious iconography may also seem insulting to some who feel themselves to be among the faithful but with that said I don't believe this film to carry any ill will towards the majority of Christians and it's more about those who twist the doctrine as justification for heinous actions. However the ending may leave some wondering where the film stands given where we eventually end up, but it does make a good topic of conversation for people to explore their differing views.The Lodge is an effectively unsettling slow burn horror film that uses its minimalist aesthetics economically and effectively. From its effective performances to its barren landscapes and claustrophobic cinematography it'll leave viewers in a state of unease that makes them feel as though they're stuck in the titular lodge along side the characters</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: There has been next to no fanfare for the release of this murder mystery. Which is surprising, considering the talent involved in front of the camera (Jeremy Renner, Elizabeth Olsen) and behind it (writer-director Taylor Sheridan). Fresh from joining the ranks of top-tiered screenwriters after the amazing one-two punch of Sicario and Hell or High Water, Sheridan continues his stellar run with a heart-wrenching study of loss and grief wrapped in a taut crime thriller narrative. Also having a crack at directing, Sheridan allows the snowy Wyoming setting to completely envelope the characters in a world that feels like it has no exits, both physically and emotionally. When this Native American community is hit with a homicide it feels like another tragedy in a long line of tragedies; their shock is replaced with deeper sorrow, their outrage is replaced with solemn defeat. Entering the scene like a fish out of water, Olsen's junior FBI agent Jane Banner must traverse the tricky cultural complexities if she's to understand the clues in front of her. Luckily she has Renner's local hunter Cory Lambert to assist, himself battling with a past family disaster. Renner and Olsen are both in terrific form, the former hiding his grief under a stoic veneer, the latter balancing big-city attitude with a genuine desire to find justice for the victim. Veteran character actor Gil Birmingham is also superb as a father unsure of how to deal with his earth-shattering loss. If this all sounds a bit heavy, well it is, but Sheridan's careful to inject a healthy dose of suspense and mild action to keep the drama gripping rather than overbearing; the finale in particular turns the movie on its head in an unpredictable but extremely effective manner. An intelligent, slow burning and provocative viewing that enthrals from start to finish, Wind River is an understated gem that deserves an audience</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Its about time we get a great show like this! It reminds me so much of The Wonder Years (One of my favourite shows of all times). It is funny, all the actors are fantastic and have great chemistry together. After 3 episodes it quickly became my new favourite show. At the end of each episode there is a clip of the real family it is based on (Adam Goldberg) which I love. I think this is why the show works so great, is because its based on a real family and real stories. So many shows and movies you watch and there isn't anything realistic about it, so they are entertaining but not something you can relate to. That is not the case with this show, and that is why it reminds me so much of The Wonder Years. It mixes comedy with story telling. I can't rave about this show enough, and I will be FURIOUS if it gets cancelled</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Its about time we get a great show like this! It reminds me so much of The Wonder Years (One of my favourite shows of all times). It is funny, all the actors are fantastic and have great chemistry together. After 3 episodes it quickly became my new favourite show. At the end of each episode there is a clip of the real family it is based on (Adam Goldberg) which I love. I think this is why the show works so great, is because its based on a real family and real stories. So many shows and movies you watch and there isn't anything realistic about it, so they are entertaining but not something you can relate to. That is not the case with this show, and that is why it reminds me so much of The Wonder Years. It mixes comedy with story telling. I can't rave about this show enough, and I will be FURIOUS if it gets cancelled</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Outstandig german comedy serie.The first 5 or so seasons are somewhat conventional comedy with standalone episodes (all of about 30mins). With continuity what concerns the actors and figures, but lesser what concerns the overall story. Nevertheless, it is not the usual comedy delivering cheap laughs every 2 minutes. The hole serie has excellent and very elaborated scripts with good stories, which slowly build up to fewer funny moments. In this regard it is an intelligent comedy with limited, but mature jokes that are really funny. No cheap, cheesy sketch-like usual stuff, nor the usual sitcom-like rushed action. Also the background stories do reflect a variety of everyday human conditions.Season 8 was a somewhat different approach with fewer explicit comedy elements, more focused on telling an odd and strange story, I still liked it.Season 9 switched to complete continuity of the story and IMO excels also with a somewhat hidden criticism of the shallow productions of the german TV, which in fact is very dependant on the contributions of the state TV under public law and fees.A very good serie. And it has to be said, within german standards, absolutely outstanding. An exception within the flood of conventional, political correct and boring german series, where there seems to be truly a conspiracy for a focus on the inflational production of mediocre or average BS.An insider tip for foreigners settling in the german language area and getting used to it</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Breaking news - this is not a documentary. For anyone looking for a highly realistic show about firefighters or paramedics, police or doctors, this is not the show for you. This is a show designed to entertain not inform. It is a spin off from Grey's Anatomy so you're looking at the same level of melodrama that has kept that show on air for 13 years.I have thoroughly enjoyed every episode of the first season. I have loved the charater development and the interactions between the characters. I wonder if some people have an issue with this show because it features so many strong female characters and they feel uncomfortable with the concept that women are people too and highly capable of doing the same jobs as men. Sometimes they even do that while other women also occupy positions in the same department. Shocking, I know.If you're looking for something not too serious to entertain you then this is a good option. While I wouldn't take it too seriously it does touch on a few important issues and there's a few tearjerker moments. Can't wait for season 2</review>

 --- Review: Breaking news - this is not a documentary. For anyone looking for a highly realistic show about firefighters or paramedics, police or doctors, this is not the show for you. This is a show designed to entertain not inform. It is a spin off from Grey's Anatomy so you're looking at the same level of melodrama that has kept that show on air for 13 years.I have thoroughly enjoyed every episode of the first season. I have loved the charater development and the interactions between the characters. I wonder if some people have an issue with this show because it features so many strong female characters and they feel uncomfortable with the concept that women are people too and highly capable of doing the same jobs as men. Sometimes they even do that while other women also occupy positions in the same department.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I personally have been waiting to see a show based on spooky plots and this show delivers. Supernatural is somewhat endearing in that the main characters (the only ones who will be recurring) are brothers, however, the writing makes the characters more believable. They are different from each other, each with their own take on life and things that are not typical. I think as the show goes on it will continue to get better,though it is great now. I can't wait to see more of this show! Another plus is the little bits of humor placed here and there, which, when done right, is always a plus. Some of the best shows/movies are ones in which one minute you are sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nails and the next you are laughing at some irony or funny statement/joke a character has said. Also, having two very attractive men in the cast doesn't hurt, either ;)</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I personally have been waiting to see a show based on spooky plots and this show delivers. Supernatural is somewhat endearing in that the main characters (the only ones who will be recurring) are brothers, however, the writing makes the characters more believable. They are different from each other, each with their own take on life and things that are not typical. I think as the show goes on it will continue to get better,though it is great now. I can't wait to see more of this show! Another plus is the little bits of humor placed here and there, which, when done right, is always a plus. Some of the best shows/movies are ones in which one minute you are sitting on the edge of your seat biting your nails and the next you are laughing at some irony or funny statement/joke a character has said. Also, having two very attractive men in the cast doesn't hurt, either ;)</review>

 --- Viewers reactions: Supernatural is a dream for everyone who loves the horror/suspense genre ... Two stars for Misha and Jensen, ... Thank Chuck it's over ... Mark Sheppard and Misha Collins deserved better ... And I said "Always keep fighting", you know, like a liar.</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Outstandig german comedy serie.The first 5 or so seasons are somewhat conventional comedy with standalone episodes (all of about 30mins). With continuity what concerns the actors and figures, but lesser what concerns the overall story. Nevertheless, it is not the usual comedy delivering cheap laughs every 2 minutes. The hole serie has excellent and very elaborated scripts with good stories, which slowly build up to fewer funny moments. In this regard it is an intelligent comedy with limited, but mature jokes that are really funny. No cheap, cheesy sketch-like usual stuff, nor the usual sitcom-like rushed action. Also the background stories do reflect a variety of everyday human conditions.Season 8 was a somewhat different approach with fewer explicit comedy elements, more focused on telling an odd and strange story, I still liked it.Season 9 switched to complete continuity of the story and IMO excels also with a somewhat hidden criticism of the shallow productions of the german TV, which in fact is very dependant on the contributions of the state TV under public law and fees.A very good serie. And it has to be said, within german standards, absolutely outstanding. An exception within the flood of conventional, political correct and boring german series, where there seems to be truly a conspiracy for a focus on the inflational production of mediocre or average BS.An insider tip for foreigners settling in the german language area and getting used to it</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: This show proves that - despite much doubt - German television can be entertaining, intelligent, and extremely funny. DER LETZTE BULLE is truly excellent and can easily compare to international productions. It gives you just the right combination of splendid humur, entertaining story lines, and a strong human factor. Authors, directors, and the whole cast and crew really do a wonderful job: The dialog is absolutely outstanding.The characters are deep, unique and hugely likable. Although the basic idea of the series has been somewhat exhausted after two seasons, the interesting development of Mick, Andreas and the others keeps you hooked. The brilliant use of the 80s/90s-Soundtrack also adds to the fun. Great work</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: A lot of people laugh at David Hasselhoff and write Knight Rider off as a corny piece of 80s television. I still think this is one of the coolest shows ever, and I freely admit that Knight Rider can be pretty idiotic at the same time. The series was basically a cartoon and that can make it hard for some people to revisit when they grow up. I think that Knight Rider is one of the best unintentionally hilarious shows ever created. The silly aspects of the series make it just that much more entertaining in adult life. Knight Rider is an endearing and nostalgic series that finds a way to entertain you despite how ridiculous it can all be. "Michael &amp; KITT", how can you not feel the tug of the old days back in the 80s when you hear that? We all grew up with this show back in the 1980's as kids, the appeal of a cool looking black sports car that could TALK was irresistible back then. Today I guess we look back at Knight Rider and wonder "wtf". It might make us recoil, and get pretty damn embarrassed with some of the out there stuff we used to think was so cool. The immense flaws of logic and continuity that plagued Knight Rider were easily hidden to a casual child viewing the show back in 1982 (I was 5 years old), but they really stick out like a sore thumb when viewed through adult eyes. The same damn stock footage was used ad nauseum, the frames were sped up to make a car going 20 mph look like it was zipping along at 400 mph, blue filters were always used to make it look like it was night time; and as others have mentioned, the fight scenes were never, ever believable. I don't think they even had any kind of trained fight specialist on Knight Rider, it always seemed like the director just told Hasselhoff or the stunt doubles to simply go out there and just make up some crap that could pass for jujitsu or tae-kwon-do. But again, this is what makes Knight Rider so fun.This series is loaded with all kinds of unintentional hilarity. Some of my favorites are when David Hasselhoff's stunt double wears a mustache in a take, or the episode when the stunt double's Michael Knight afro wig accidentally flew off while he was doing one of those patented "Hasselhoff-Fu" roundhouse karate kicks. It seemed like Michael Knight could take down any bad guy with one well placed karate kick to the head. Let's all be honest with ourselves, a big reason this show was popular was because it featured a really cool looking black car with that cool looking red scanner mounted in the front. Everyone loved that car, and there is no doubt that is the reason Knight Rider is a part of American pop cultural lore. I'm 26 1/2 years old today and I still like this show because it's my childhood, and because it's from the 80's that we all love and grew up in. Things would get so stupid, you often wondered if there would be a button on KITT's dashboard that would say "Drive Very Fast" instead of "Super Pursuit Mode". The show didn't magically become any more nerdier in the 2000's then it was in the 1980s. Even back in the early-mid 80s most people over the age of 15 had a tendency to laugh at Knight Rider. It was always cool to children that didn't pick apart the series, but not so to anyone above the 9th grade. The prime target audience was boys that were roughly 9 years of age. So if you were already over the age of 13 back in 1982 when Knight Rider first aired, then you were likely going to always be too cool for a show like this that leaned on being a live action cartoon. Yes it is amazing that this series lasted on NBC's prime time for 4 years. But aren't we glad it did</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I LOVE this show, LOVE it, its just the shot in the arm TV needs, its the complete antithesis of most of the other American shows we get here in the UK and its such a welcome contrast.There are some superb TV shows on offer at the moment, Breaking Bad, Mad Men, genre shows like Dexter, Tru Blood and Walking Dead, all diverse, all excellent top draw entertainment.Its the success of these shows that makes Five-0 such a great alternative, its fast paced, funny, has plenty of crash, bang, wallop and it looks great.A guilty pleasure you say ? NO, this exactly what TV should be doing, offering choice, i hate reality and talent shows with every fibre of my being, but they cater to people who do like them, so i feel that i deserve an action packed cop show now and again.Choice is the key factor in everything we do for recreation today, TV like it or not is a big part of peoples recreation, so its right that it should be offering a diversity of shows that appeal to all tastes.As to the issue of remakes/boots, whatever, this tired argument ran out of steam on Battlestar Galactica, i ranted against the new one, then sat and watched it and realised that, you can like both, the hypocrisy cops are not going to kick your door down. If you like it, good, if you don't like it, good, but ranting about the revisiting of classics is like arguing with the weather. I used to watch the original Five-0 here in the UK (Saturday nights, ITV, late on) loved it, but i can find some room for the new one too.This show has to get a second series, this is flat out brilliant TV, in the middle of a worldwide recession, political and social upheaval rife, the upbeat, take no prisoners, ass kicking note of Hawaii's favourite Five-0 unit is just the tonic</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Its about time we get a great show like this! It reminds me so much of The Wonder Years (One of my favourite shows of all times). It is funny, all the actors are fantastic and have great chemistry together. After 3 episodes it quickly became my new favourite show. At the end of each episode there is a clip of the real family it is based on (Adam Goldberg) which I love. I think this is why the show works so great, is because its based on a real family and real stories. So many shows and movies you watch and there isn't anything realistic about it, so they are entertaining but not something you can relate to. That is not the case with this show, and that is why it reminds me so much of The Wonder Years. It mixes comedy with story telling. I can't rave about this show enough, and I will be FURIOUS if it gets cancelled</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: For those still in withdrawal from the cancellation of Arrested Development, let me write you a prescription: Modern Family. The comparisons are obvious and with good reason. The postmodern comedy for the 21 century was ushered in by The Office(UK) and Arrested Development, but I, for one, doubted something could come along and satiate my longing for another truly, original comedy. Albeit, you may initially be wary to see yet another mockumentary-style show, but by the end of the pilot, you'll be smiling/laughing way too hard to stay cynical. Thus far, the plot lines have been really fresh and the characters are so, for lack of a better word, lovable. This show fulfills all my comedy needs, and I feel like I must resort to the listing of relevant adjectives: Witty, dry, smart, outlandish, silly, clever, cute, sarcastic, subtle, not-so subtle. HILARIOUS. I hate to say it, but the laugh tracks and raw goofyness of classic sitcoms like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends' are obsolete and leave something to be desired. You will find that something in Modern Family. And who knows, maybe some of the more painfully funny and poignant scenarios will reveal insight into the changing dynamics of both the modern family and modern comedy. Great show. Period. And let's get it right this time around: don't cancel good TV shows. Pretty please</review>

Albeit, you may initially be wary to see yet another mockumentary-style show, but by the end of the pilot, you'll be smiling/laughing way too hard to stay cynical. Thus far, the plot lines have been really fresh and the characters are so, for lack of a better word, lovable. This show fulfills all my comedy needs, and I feel like I must resort to the listing of relevant adjectives: Witty, dry, smart, outlandish, silly, clever, cute, sarcastic, subtle, not-so subtle. HILARIOUS. I hate to say it, but the laugh tracks and raw goofyness of classic sitcoms like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends' are obsolete and leave something to be desired. You will find that something in Modern Family. And who knows, maybe some of the more painfully funny and poignant scenarios will reveal insight into the changing dynamics of both the modern family and modern comedy. Great show. Period. And let's get it right this time around: don't cancel good TV shows. Pretty please</review>

 --- Review: For those still in withdrawal from the cancellation of Arrested Development, let me write you a prescription: Modern Family. The comparisons are obvious and with good reason. The postmodern comedy for the 21 century was ushered in by The Office(UK) and Arrested Development, but I, for one, doubted something could come along and satiate my longing for another truly, original comedy. Albeit, you may initially be wary to see yet another mockumentary-style show, but by the end of the pilot, you'll be smiling/laughing way too hard to stay cynical.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: A lot of people laugh at David Hasselhoff and write Knight Rider off as a corny piece of 80s television. I still think this is one of the coolest shows ever, and I freely admit that Knight Rider can be pretty idiotic at the same time. The series was basically a cartoon and that can make it hard for some people to revisit when they grow up. I think that Knight Rider is one of the best unintentionally hilarious shows ever created. The silly aspects of the series make it just that much more entertaining in adult life. Knight Rider is an endearing and nostalgic series that finds a way to entertain you despite how ridiculous it can all be. "Michael &amp; KITT", how can you not feel the tug of the old days back in the 80s when you hear that? We all grew up with this show back in the 1980's as kids, the appeal of a cool looking black sports car that could TALK was irresistible back then. Today I guess we look back at Knight Rider and wonder "wtf". It might make us recoil, and get pretty damn embarrassed with some of the out there stuff we used to think was so cool. The immense flaws of logic and continuity that plagued Knight Rider were easily hidden to a casual child viewing the show back in 1982 (I was 5 years old), but they really stick out like a sore thumb when viewed through adult eyes. The same damn stock footage was used ad nauseum, the frames were sped up to make a car going 20 mph look like it was zipping along at 400 mph, blue filters were always used to make it look like it was night time; and as others have mentioned, the fight scenes were never, ever believable. I don't think they even had any kind of trained fight specialist on Knight Rider, it always seemed like the director just told Hasselhoff or the stunt doubles to simply go out there and just make up some crap that could pass for jujitsu or tae-kwon-do. But again, this is what makes Knight Rider so fun.This series is loaded with all kinds of unintentional hilarity. Some of my favorites are when David Hasselhoff's stunt double wears a mustache in a take, or the episode when the stunt double's Michael Knight afro wig accidentally flew off while he was doing one of those patented "Hasselhoff-Fu" roundhouse karate kicks. It seemed like Michael Knight could take down any bad guy with one well placed karate kick to the head. Let's all be honest with ourselves, a big reason this show was popular was because it featured a really cool looking black car with that cool looking red scanner mounted in the front. Everyone loved that car, and there is no doubt that is the reason Knight Rider is a part of American pop cultural lore. I'm 26 1/2 years old today and I still like this show because it's my childhood, and because it's from the 80's that we all love and grew up in. Things would get so stupid, you often wondered if there would be a button on KITT's dashboard that would say "Drive Very Fast" instead of "Super Pursuit Mode". The show didn't magically become any more nerdier in the 2000's then it was in the 1980s. Even back in the early-mid 80s most people over the age of 15 had a tendency to laugh at Knight Rider. It was always cool to children that didn't pick apart the series, but not so to anyone above the 9th grade. The prime target audience was boys that were roughly 9 years of age. So if you were already over the age of 13 back in 1982 when Knight Rider first aired, then you were likely going to always be too cool for a show like this that leaned on being a live action cartoon. Yes it is amazing that this series lasted on NBC's prime time for 4 years. But aren't we glad it did</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Its about time we get a great show like this! It reminds me so much of The Wonder Years (One of my favourite shows of all times). It is funny, all the actors are fantastic and have great chemistry together. After 3 episodes it quickly became my new favourite show. At the end of each episode there is a clip of the real family it is based on (Adam Goldberg) which I love. I think this is why the show works so great, is because its based on a real family and real stories. So many shows and movies you watch and there isn't anything realistic about it, so they are entertaining but not something you can relate to. That is not the case with this show, and that is why it reminds me so much of The Wonder Years. It mixes comedy with story telling. I can't rave about this show enough, and I will be FURIOUS if it gets cancelled</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: For those still in withdrawal from the cancellation of Arrested Development, let me write you a prescription: Modern Family. The comparisons are obvious and with good reason. The postmodern comedy for the 21 century was ushered in by The Office(UK) and Arrested Development, but I, for one, doubted something could come along and satiate my longing for another truly, original comedy. Albeit, you may initially be wary to see yet another mockumentary-style show, but by the end of the pilot, you'll be smiling/laughing way too hard to stay cynical. Thus far, the plot lines have been really fresh and the characters are so, for lack of a better word, lovable. This show fulfills all my comedy needs, and I feel like I must resort to the listing of relevant adjectives: Witty, dry, smart, outlandish, silly, clever, cute, sarcastic, subtle, not-so subtle. HILARIOUS. I hate to say it, but the laugh tracks and raw goofyness of classic sitcoms like 'Seinfeld' and 'Friends' are obsolete and leave something to be desired. You will find that something in Modern Family. And who knows, maybe some of the more painfully funny and poignant scenarios will reveal insight into the changing dynamics of both the modern family and modern comedy. Great show. Period. And let's get it right this time around: don't cancel good TV shows. Pretty please</review>

    <title lang="xx">La dernière folie de Claire Darling</title>
    <title lang="pl">Pamiątki Claire Darling</title>
    <desc lang="xx">Directed by Julie Bertuccelli.  With Catherine Deneuve, Chiara Mastroianni, Alice Taglioni, Laure Calamy. In Verderonne, a small village in the Oise, it's the first day of summer and Claire Darling wakes up convinced to live her last day - She then decides to empty her house and brade everything without distinction, Tiffany lamps to the collection clock. The objects so loved echo her tragic and flamboyant life. This last madness brings back Mary, her daughter, whom she has not seen for 20 years.</desc>
    <desc lang="pl">Claire Darling (Catherine Deneuve) jest ekscentryczną matroną, której od pewnego czasu dokucza samotność. Pewnego dnia otrzymuje - jak jej się wydaje - znak od samego Boga, że czas już położyć kres swojemu wypełnionemu zbytkami życiu. Starsza kobieta postanawia posłuchać intuicji i wystawia na trawniku przed swoim domem nieomal całą jego zawartość - absurdalnie przecenione antyki i rodzinne pamiątki. Każdy z nich otwiera Claire drogę do w większości bolesnych wspomnień. Tymczasem córka Claire, Marie (Chiara Mastroianni), poinformowana przez koleżanki z dawnych lat o dziwnym zachowaniu matrony, powraca w rodzinne strony. Musi dowiedzieć się, jakie motywy kierują Claire. Nielinearna opowieść o trudnych relacjach między matką i córką w reżyserii cenionej Julii Bertuccelli, nominowanej do Europejskiej Nagrody Filmowej. Twórczyni była niegdyś asystentką Krzysztofa Kieślowskiego.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Perhaps because I'm somewhat depressed and have been for some time and probably will be for some time more, this film was perfect. In my early sixties I'm midway between the ages of the mother and the daughter so I obviously could relate. I was expecting it to be a slightly lighthearted romp through the journey of a mother and daughter as they grapple with the mother's onset of dementia. But actually it was a serious, poignant, eloquent and moving telling of a sad family story. The music was perfect and I was able to listen to it on my way home in the car thanks to Spotify.

    <desc lang="pl">Katherine Newbury (Emma Thompson) jest wygadaną i przebojową prowadzącą nocnych talk-show. Po dwudziestu pięciu latach zawrotnej kariery oglądalność jej programu, dotychczas cieszącego się ogromną popularnością, zaczyna w końcu spadać. Prowadząca zastanawia się nad rozwiązaniami tego problemu i w końcu dochodzi do wniosku, że należy wzbogacić zespół, złożony z samych pewnych siebie mężczyzn, o nowego członka - kobietę. Jej wybór pada na charyzmatyczną i pełną niepohamowanego entuzjazmu Molly (Mindy Kaling). Chociaż kobieta nie ma doświadczenia w zawodzie, potrafi pochwalić się niemal encyklopedyczną wiedzą o pracy Newbury. Niesztampowa komedia z wyróżnioną dwoma Oscarami Emmą Thompson w roli głównej.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I very much enjoy this installment of the series. Not very fond of any of the others. The Return of the Pink Panther just has it all in my opinion. You get a crime story, funny/stupid humor, Clouseau who still has no idea of what's going on(this just makes the movie what it is).The fight between Clouseau and Kato in the apartment is hilarious. One has to wonder how long Kato was waiting in the refrigerator. The fight is just very slapstick and clumsy that it makes me and my girlfriend laugh every time we see it. Another great point of the film is the numerous cars that Clouseau goes through. Loosing a few into a pool. The mental breakdown of Herbert Lom's character is also one of the film's fine points. This is -- my opinion -- the funniest of the series. I have always enjoyed it, and most likely will always enjoy it</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: The inimitable Peter Sellers strikes again as Chief Inspector Jacques Clouseau, in this fourth installment of the classic `Pink Panther' series, `The Pink Panther Strikes Again,' directed by Blake Edwards. Given the fact that the assessment of comedy is intrinsically subjective, this film is arguably laugh for laugh and sight gag for sight gag the funniest of the five (followed closely by the second of the series, the hilarious farce, `A Shot In The Dark). In this one, former Chief Inspector Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) is about to be released from the mental hospital-- in which he has resided since being driven crazy by Clouseau-- when on the very afternoon of his hearing he is visited by none other than Clouseau himself, who has come to speak on behalf of his former boss. Suffice to say that by the time Clouseau is through `helping,' he is driven from the premises by the relapsed, raving madman, Dreyfus. And it's only the beginning of the inept French Inspector's antics that, before it is over, will include a trip to the Ocktoberfest, encounters with a dozen hit-men from around the world, a beautiful Russian spy named Olga (Lesley-Anne Down), a surprise Egyptian spy (who will remain nameless) and a one-man assault on a castle. As Laurel and Hardy proved so many times before, for every action there is a reaction; a theorem of which proof is unequivocally provided here by the relationship between Sellers and Lom. This was the film in which Edwards and his stars not only further devised, but honed to perfection, their foolproof formula for laughs: After the `first wave' of hilarity provided by Sellers, it is followed up-- in just enough instances to be totally effective-- by Lom's reaction to 1.) Sellers directly (as in the first, classic scene at the mental hospital), or 2.) Lom's reaction to Seller's antics as they are related to him by a third party. It's a one-two punch that never fails and which, in effect, derives twice the fun from a single gag. And it's brilliant. But at the end of the day, it must be noted that there is one element above all else that accounts for the success of this film, and that, of course, is the Man himself, Peter Sellers. Sellers must be regarded as-- if not `the,' then at least one of the-- funniest actors ever to grace the silver screen. There was no end to the ways he could make you laugh; from the subtlest expression-- an eye averted or perhaps the slight raising of an eyebrow-- to the broadest slapstick, it was all within his personal domain, and he was the Master. Physically, practically all he had to do to get a laugh was show up; consider the scene in which he arrives at the hospital to visit Dreyfus: As he saunters across the lawn of the vast grounds surrounding the buildings, a croquet mallet and ball lying to one side catches his eye; there is just the slightest hesitation in his step, the subtlest change of expression in his eyes and the merest inclination of the head. And there, in that briefest of moments upon the screen, you know-- beyond the shadow of a doubt-- what is about to transpire. And you're right; a moment later Clouseau has the mallet in his hand and his foot on the ball, and even as it's happening-- just as you knew it would in that split second before it did-- he has you on the floor laughing. That was the gift-- and the genius-- of Peter Sellers. Was every film he made a classic? A great film? Of course not; but you would be hard put to find a single performance of his, even in a bad film (Like 1970's `There's A Girl In My Soup'), that did not embody that unique spark that defined him. It was certainly alive in his portrayal of Clouseau (possibly the definitive Seller's character), and in retrospect, what a shame it seems that there were only five `Panther' movies ever made. But so it is, and shall ever be. The supporting cast includes Burt Kwouk (as the ever faithful and attacking manservant, Cato), Andre Maranne (Francois), Colin Blakely (Alec Drummond), Leonard Rossiter (Inspector Quinlan), Richard Vernon (Dr. Fassbender), Briony McRoberts (Margo) and Michael Robbins (Jarvis). A funny movie that showcases one of Cinema's truly unique and funny actors, `The Pink Panther Strikes Again' is a side-splitting, fun movie you can watch over and over and never grow tired of. The best of the series, it stands as a glowing tribute to the comedic genius of Peter Sellers. I rate this one 10/10</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: What a dire spectacle this was!The film succeeds in providing a glimpse into the grotesque Bulgarian reality of today. Ignorance, crude behaviour and manners, dishonesty and utter lack of empathy pervade every aspect of life; throughout the whole film you will not hear the words "please" or "thank you", as if they have been erased from the language. Harking back to the inherited values from 50 years of the "Socialist paradise" and thrown into acute focus, you see the disinterested police force, which nevertheless doesn't fail to be brutish, the corrupt doctors who defraud the health system, the unscrupulous new age mystic charlatans praying on the poor, the brainless "cultural workers" of the socialist age, the incompetent new "professionals" who can't turn in a piece of quality work....all this is convincingly bound together through the incessant lies of the son and the imbecilic delusions of the father.Cinematically, the film is sound, with good all round performances and unsparing cinematography, but as a Bulgarian myself I wish I had not seen it; it disheartens you so</review>

    <title lang="pl">Godziny</title>
    <desc lang="xx">Directed by Stephen Daldry.  With Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore, Stephen Dillane. The story of how the novel "Mrs. Dalloway" affects three generations of women, all of whom, in one way or another, have had to deal with suicide in their lives.</desc>
    <desc lang="pl">Anglia, lata 20. Pisarka Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) po kolejnym załamaniu nerwowym wraca do męża i ich domu położonego nieopodal Londynu. Kobieta zaczyna pracować nad swoją nową powieścią, w której opisuje jeden dzień z życia Clarissy Dalloway. Cały czas zmaga się z chorobą psychiczną. Los Angeles, początek lat 50. Laura Brown (Julianne Moore), żona i matka małego Richiego, oczekuje kolejnego dziecka. Czyta powieść Woolf "Pani Dalloway", która uświadamia jej, jak wielką pustkę czuje w swoim życiu. Rola gospodyni domowej przytłacza kobietę, a pozorne rodzinne szczęście budzi w niej rozpacz. Powoli pogrąża się w depresji. Nowy Jork, 2001 rok. Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep) przygotowuje przyjęcie na cześć swojego przyjaciela Richarda - poety, który umiera na AIDS. Niczym powieściowa pani Dalloway kupuje kwiaty, spotyka przyjaciół, rozmyśla nad swoim życiem nie do końca takim, jakie sobie wymarzyła....Wielowątkowa opowieść jest adaptacją prozy Michaela Cunninghama. Kobiety, żyjące w różnych epokach, łączy powieść Virginii Woolf oraz poczucie osamotnienia, depresja, wrażliwość i zagubienie. Obsypany nagrodami obraz, wśród których są Oscar i Złoty Glob dla Nicole Kidman.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: "The Hours" more than lives up to its critical praise. If nothing else it is a must see for the originality of the technique. The film (and the book by Michael Cunningham) is structured around the process of linking up three stories set at different points in time. Each story concerns a woman trying to define herself, to identify what she needs, and to find a way to get it.The 1920's story concerns Virginia Woolf's (Kidman) efforts to write her first successful novel, "Mrs. Dallaway"; which is the story of one day in the life of a woman named Clarissa Dallaway. The story set in the early 1950's concerns Laura Brown (Moore), a woman who is reading "Mrs. Dallaway". Finally the contemporary story concerns Clarissa Vaughn (Streep) who is essentially living Mrs. Dallaway's life in modern NYC. All three performances are extraordinary in their own unique ways and there are wonderful performances from all members of the supporting cast. It is as if each member of the ensemble brought out the best in each other.Some interesting and not always obvious things to look for as you watch "The Hours" are:Each story begins with the husband/lover of each woman leading the camera to the woman. All three women are found in bed and this begins a match cut process that will repeat itself throughout the film as the director and editor work to connect and unify the three separate stories. Woolf writes: "Mrs. Dallaway said she would buy the flowers herself" just as Laura Brown reads that sentence and Clarissa speaks that sentence.Kidman's Woolf is an amazing character. She is a psychological mess, making life difficult for those around her and full of torment and despair. Yet she has a subtle charm that helps you to understand why people found her fascinating. Like "The Big Chill", this is an ambitious character study film with many characters. By necessity, both films rely more on behavioral language than dialogue in revealing the personality of its characters. Note Laura Brown's (Moore) neatness obsession as she readies her house and herself prior to leaving for the hotel.Woolf began the book "Mrs. Dallaway" with the intention of basing it on a society woman she knew who unexpectedly committed suicide. Brown describes the book to her neighbor as: "Oh, it's about this woman who's incredibly - well, she's a hostess and she's incredibly confident and she's going to give a party. And, maybe because she's confident, everyone thinks she's fine... but she isn't".At its core this is a movie about art but it is a broad definition of art, writing a book-baking a cake-giving a party. Each woman/artist is driven and frustrated by a need for unattainable perfection. There is a touch of irony to each situation. For example, Laura Brown is where she is because her husband has pulled her into the great American dream without realizing that it was the worse thing he could do to her. Although all three women love their children/child/niece, those relationships do not give them what they need.There is a visitor and a kiss in each story central to the self-definition process each woman is going through. Virginia kisses her sister Vanessa (brilliantly played by Miranda Richardson who looks amazingly like she could have been Kidman's sister), desperately trying to force a better connection with her. Vanessa understands this, she is not shocked by the kiss but by the implication that her sister needs this so desperately.Sophie Wyburd who plays Virginia's young niece was obviously cast for her haunting voice and her ability to display such a focused intensity. Each woman has a child picking up on their needs, which the adults around them do not seem to be aware of. Watch the scene where Laura's husband is urging her to come to bed. Moore's voice does not betray the revulsion or the internal struggle which only viewers can see on her face. In fact at this point each woman's partner is urging her to go to bed but each must first a make choice. Then watch for the great match cut, Virginia announces that she has decided that the poet will die in her novel and they cut to little Richard lying in his bed. Moore's expression finally tells us that she has decided to leave her family. Streep's kiss signifies her recognition of the preciousness of what she still has in her life and her choice to embrace it and move forward.Ultimately this film is about the increasing difficulty we have as we get older in making choices. This is because as we discover who we are, we also experience loss and accumulate grief over the course of our lives, making us ever more aware of the cost of our choices. Like the Moonlight Graham character in "Field of Dreams" (who assumed he would have more than one major league at bat), Clarissa looks back on a short moment that she thought was the beginning of happiness and realizes that it was her only moment of actual happiness.There are some criticisms of this film. That it is not political enough but rather is for the elite and about the elite, or conversely that it is condescending to the masses with too obvious a message told in an unnecessarily simplistic way, and finally that it is a success of structure rather than ideas. Whatever the validity of these issues, the very fact that discussions are at this elevated level is the best testimonial the film could have. My only criticism was a production design issue, young Richard gets his Lincoln logs out of a Erector Set box</review>

    <desc lang="pl">Anglia, początek XX wieku. Nastolatek John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (Nicholas Hoult) niespodziewanie traci ojca, a wkrótce matkę. Osieroconego chłopca opieką otacza Kościół katolicki i zamożna pani Faulkner. Dzięki stypendium uczy się w elitarnej szkole Króla Edwarda w Birmingham. Razem ze szkolnymi przyjaciółmi, Geoffreyem Smithem (Anthony Boyle), Christopherem Wisemanem (Tom Glynn-Carney ) i Robertem Gilsonem (Patrick Gibson), zakłada klub literacki. Zakochuje się w starszej od siebie Edith Bratt (Lily Collins). Dziewczyna odwzajemnia jego uczucia. Nieco później Tolkien rozpoczyna studia lingwistyczne na Oksfordzie, gdzie zaczyna pasjonować się najpierw greką, a potem językiem walijskim i staroangielskim. Skłania go to do tworzenia własnego języka. Gdy wybucha I wojna światowa, jedzie na front. Bierze udział w brutalnych walkach, podczas których zapada na gorączkę okopową. Te przeżycia inspirują go do napisania "Władcy Pierścieni". Krewni Tolkiena wystosowali oficjalne oświadczenie, że nie byli włączeni w pracę nad filmem ani w żaden sposób go nie wspierają.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I am a huge Tolkien fan and after reading some of the critics reviews I was a bit wary of seeing this film. I do not know which film the "critics" have seen but from their conclusions I do not recognise this film. I have literally just left the cinema, I found it so moving that I found myself in floods of tears. Beautifully acted, and set against the backdrop of WW1 the sense of loss and the harrowing reality of what war is came across in such depth. I loved the focus on language and the weight it can carry, It made me feel that words are in their own right living creatures.

    <desc lang="pl">30-letnia Billi (Awkwafina), która jako dziecko przeniosła się z rodzicami z Chin do Stanów Zjednoczonych, przechodzi trudny okres w życiu: dowiaduje się, że nie przyznano jej stypendium, właścicielka mieszkania wypowiada jej najem, a zza oceanu dociera do niej wiadomość o poważnej chorobie ukochanej babci Nai Nai (Shuzhen Zhou). Wnuczka chce jak najszybciej wsiąść do samolotu, by ją odwiedzić. Dowiaduje się jednak, że rodzice i krewni zdecydowali się zataić przed cierpiącą na nowotwór staruszką przykrą informację. Chcą pożegnać chorą, której zostało zaledwie kilka miesięcy życia, ale nie przekazywać jej smutnej prawdy i do końca pozostawić ją w błogiej nieświadomości. Wymyślają więc pretekst dla rodzinnego zjazdu - ślub kuzyna. Oparta na wątkach autobiograficznych opowieść Lulu Wang, zmuszająca do wzruszeń, śmiechu i refleksji, z nagrodzoną Złotym Globem rolą Awkwafiny w kategorii najlepsza aktorka w komedii lub musicalu.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: The Farewell is a bittersweet Chinese tragicomedy that has the potential to become an Academy Award winner for Best International Feature Film. The movie revolves around an elderly Chinese lady who suffers from an incurable cancer. Her sister however hides this information from her and instead tries to bring all the family together for one last time. A hastily arranged wedding between a grandson and his Japanese girlfriend serves as purpose for the family members abroad to come back to Changchun. However, the burden of this lie is heavy and conflicts, confusion and misunderstandings soon occur.The most interesting question about this movie is how you would deal with a situation such as the one portrayed in this film if someone close to you were concerned and how you would like to be treated if you were in a similar situation yourself. The family members in this film try to carry the burden together and decide to not tell the aged grandmother that she is dying. There is no right way to deal with such a difficult decision. If you hide the truth, you might prevent the other person to live every day as if it were the last day and to say farewell. If you tell the truth, you will cause an immense emotional burden to the concerned person who will live in fear of dying every single day. The Farewell offers much food for thought and also shows how differently Western and Eastern cultures approach such a scenario.The acting performances in this film are outstanding. Every character has its own identity from the drunk war veteran who was in love with the elderly lady over the chubby grandchild who is addicted to technology to the deaf housemate who is the only one to mind his own business. Lead actress Nora Lum convinces as concerned granddaughter who disagrees with her family's strategy of hiding the truth from her grandmother and who also has some financial and social problems of her own. Shuzhen Zhao steals the show in her very first movie as headstrong elderly lady with a heart of gold.The movie portrays the differences between Western and Eastern cultures cleverly and also portrays how the Chinese society is changing. People have become greedy capitalists looking for financial opportunities abroad but also try to embrace their ethnic heritage at the same time. Changchun has developed from a rather small city with less than a million citizens to a gigantic city with close to eight million citizens in only fifty years. The movie shows how gigantic buildings and monuments have replaced small houses and gardens.The Farewell also has alight-hearted side and manages to cheer its audience up despite numerous heartbreaking moments. The subtle humour works very well and includes drunk war veterans declaring their romantic feelings, hilarious karaoke performances during the wedding and several running jokes in form of the careless deaf housemate and the disconnected overweight grandson.In the end, The Farewell is an emotional tragicomedy with a profound message: to spend as much time with your loved ones as you can while you can. As someone who is living abroad and far away from his family, I can truly empathize with the movie's meaningful message. Give this movie the chance to inspire your brain and warm your heart</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I saw it as a religious film. Not only for the end but for fine, wise reflection of vulnerability, fears and courage. For a sort of special poetry. And for the inspired performance of Valentin Novopolskij. A film reflecting the West from the perspectives of East people . Good portraits of characters, wise use of symbols and a precise message. A film about illusions and fears. A real good one and, maybe, useful for its bitterness and eye of hope</review>

 --- Actors: Valentin Novopolskij (role=Oleg), Dawid Ogrodnik (role=Andrzej), Anna Próchniak (role=Malgosia), Guna Zarina (role=Zita), Adam Szyszkowski (role=Krzysztof), Marcos Adamantiadis (role=Detective), Ronald Beurms (role=Policeman), Paulius Cizinauskas (role=Worker at the meat factory), Toussaint Colombani (role=Interpreter), Jean-Henri Compère (role=Inspector), Jurijs Djakonovs (role=Sergejs), Valentinas Krulikovskis (role=Romanian)
 --- Review: I saw it as a religious film. Not only for the end but for fine, wise reflection of vulnerability, fears and courage. For a sort of special poetry. And for the inspired performance of Valentin Novopolskij. A film reflecting the West from the perspectives of East people . Good portraits of characters, wise use of symbols and a precise message. A film about illusions and fears. A real good one and, maybe, useful for its bitterness and eye of hope
 --- Viewers reactions: portraits from East ... A good debut film worthy of its major awards at 5 minor film festivals</review>

    <desc lang="pl">Anglia, początek XX wieku. Nastolatek John Ronald Reuel Tolkien (Nicholas Hoult) niespodziewanie traci ojca, a wkrótce matkę. Osieroconego chłopca opieką otacza Kościół katolicki i zamożna pani Faulkner. Dzięki stypendium uczy się w elitarnej szkole Króla Edwarda w Birmingham. Razem ze szkolnymi przyjaciółmi, Geoffreyem Smithem (Anthony Boyle), Christopherem Wisemanem (Tom Glynn-Carney ) i Robertem Gilsonem (Patrick Gibson), zakłada klub literacki. Zakochuje się w starszej od siebie Edith Bratt (Lily Collins). Dziewczyna odwzajemnia jego uczucia. Nieco później Tolkien rozpoczyna studia lingwistyczne na Oksfordzie, gdzie zaczyna pasjonować się najpierw greką, a potem językiem walijskim i staroangielskim. Skłania go to do tworzenia własnego języka. Gdy wybucha I wojna światowa, jedzie na front. Bierze udział w brutalnych walkach, podczas których zapada na gorączkę okopową. Te przeżycia inspirują go do napisania "Władcy Pierścieni". Krewni Tolkiena wystosowali oficjalne oświadczenie, że nie byli włączeni w pracę nad filmem ani w żaden sposób go nie wspierają.</desc>

Because of a complicated and ultimately stupid legal battle between distributors involving this and other films this film got so lost that the only promotional material available to the theater I saw it in was a picture from a newspaper, which they pasted into a much too big poster holder. To add insult to injury despite getting raves from the New York papers, all of which wondered why the distributor was dumping a wonderful "children's" film, a new distributor, Disney released it on video after changing its name to tie into their amusement park ride, there by confusing those of us who saw this as the Wind in the Willows.This film is a great film. Its simply a fantastic film comedy, never mind the stupid label of children's or family film, this is just great movie making.The only people I know who are disappointed in it are people expecting a Monty Python film. Although it pretty much reunites all of the surviving Pythons only Jones and Eric Idle are in it for any length of time, Cleese has one scene as a lawyer and Palin is fleetingly seen as the sun. The film is light years from Python, despite having just a touch of Python's madness.The humor is gentle and loving and keeping both with the period and with modern tastes. The songs are wonderful.

    <desc lang="pl">Ośmioletni Samuel (Lukas Haas) jest świadkiem zabójstwa dokonanego na dworcu autobusowym w Filadelfii. Dochodzenie w tej sprawie prowadzi detektyw John Book (Harrison Ford). Na posterunku chłopiec wskazuje na policjanta Jamesa McFee (Danny Glover) jako mordercę. Book nabiera podejrzeń i zaczyna śledzić Jamesa. McFee go rani, na szczęście niegroźnie. Detektyw zdaje sobie sprawę, że niebezpieczeństwo grozi nie tylko jemu, lecz także Samuelowi i jego matce (Kelly McGillis). Postanawia osobiście eskortować ich do domu w Pensylwanii. Rachel i jej syn należą do wspólnoty amiszów, chrześcijan rygorystycznie przestrzegających zasad wiary, którzy odrzucają większość osiągnięć cywilizacji. Gdy Book odwozi Rachel i jej syna do wspólnoty, spotyka się z chłodnym przyjęciem. Jego pobyt w domu wdowy przeszkadza Danielowi (Alexander Godunov), który chciałby poślubić kobietę. Gdy Book odzyskuje siły, kontaktuje się z przyjacielem, policjantem. Ten go ostrzega, aby nie wracał do Filadelfii... Film Petera Weira otrzymał dwa Oscary i sześć nominacji do tej nagrody. Reżyser, twórca "Stowarzyszenia Umarłych Poetów" czy "Truman Show", jak zawsze z precyzją buduje opowieść, w której nie do końca wiadomo, co jest prawdą. Widza czeka więc wiele niespodzianek.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: This is one of those movies whose virtues and subtleties become more and more apparent with subsequent viewings. The crime story is nothing more than a pretense - a "MacGuffin", in Hitchcock's phrase - on which to hang this sensitive and insightful story of the conflict between modernity and the culture of the Amish, which is portrayed here with admiring respect and not a hint of condescension. Harrison Ford's portrayal of John Book is perhaps his finest work on screen so far. In particular, Book's struggle to suppress his rising attraction for Rachel, and his tormented realization that a relationship between them is not possible, is achingly portrayed. Ford's effort is well-matched by Kelly McGillis, whose beauty here is almost breathtaking. The erotic interplay between them, because it is unconsummated, radiates an almost painful tension, and the easily lampooned "running through the field" scene - because it has been led up to so convincingly - is almost heartbreaking. The character of Eli Lapp, wonderfully played by Jan Rubes, is richly multifaceted. His suspicion of the "English" outsider and his anger at Rachel's attraction to him, is surmounted by an underlying humanity. His parting words to Book, "You be careful out there among them English," are moving testimony to his acceptance of him. His stern yet loving dialogue to his grandson about renouncing hatred and violence is a treasured moment. Both direction and cinematography are splendid. The simplicity of Amish interiors is shot in a way that makes its austerity almost beautiful, and the barnraising scene is an exercise in cinematic lyricism.It would be easy to fault the movie for the facile scene in which the punks taunting of Book's newfound friends and protectors drives him over the edge (Eli: "It's not our way, Book" / Book: "No, but it's MY way."), but his gift to the young thug of a bloody nose is mighty satisfying to behold.My one criticism is with the music; certainly not with the venerable Maurice Jarre's score itself, but with its paltry synthesized realization. They should have found the money to spring for a full orchestra.In short, a highly satisfying, richly themed, and multifaceted film which is well worth watching</review>

Jako dziecko miał sposobność poznać smak tradycyjnej kuchni dzięki babci, która się nim opiekowała. Z biegiem lata Elias szlifuje swoje kulinarne umiejętności. Pewnego dnia spotyka się z jednym z najwybitniejszych paryskich kucharzy, Julienem Blankiem (Olivier Sitruk). Aprobata mistrza sprawia, że amator gotowania postanawia spróbować swoich sił we Francji.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: This movie is an example of what is evidently emerging as a new sub-genre in film: movies about young people who develop an interest and talent in some aspect of gastronomy, want to pursue it at the highest level, but have to leave home to do so and therefore deal with family members who do not understand why the young man can't be satisfied with the same-old same-old that is good enough for everyone else.The first, very successful example of this sub-genre that I saw - and very much enjoyed - was The Hundred-Foot Journey (2014), about a young Indian who starts by cooking traditional Indian food in his father's transplanted Indian restaurant, but eventually aspires to cook in a great Parisian restaurant. More recently there has been Uncorked (2020), about a young American who grew up working in his family's Memphis ribhouse but developed a fascination with fine wine that leads him to want to become a sommelier rather than carry on the simple rib restaurant his grandfather and father had developed.Now, in this movie, which dates from 2018, we find the odyssey of a young Moroccan who wants to do more than just cook standard Moroccan fare in a small-town Moroccan restaurant, aspiring to try new dishes in a great French restaurant that values creativity. He too has to deal with all the locals who can't understand why he can't just go on making what they have always eaten.I very much enjoyed the first half of this movie, set in a small Moroccan town. The protagonist, Elias, has to deal with the closed-mindedness of those around him, people who, as in the other movies, can't accept one person's desire to do something different as just that without interpreting - and resenting - it as a dismissal of what they themselves have always done. What I would have liked here would have been some exploration of what made his grandmother's, and then his cooking different from what everyone was used to.The second half of the movie, which deals with Elias' time in Paris, I found less satisfying. It is less focused, and skips over some very important elements (how Elias got to Paris, then how he and his friend finally become a success). It often reminded me of the less interesting, though certainly very moving, parts of a similar French movie, Fahim (2019), dealing with the miserable life of a Bangladeshi chess player and his father who go - illegally - to Paris so that the son can study with a chess master there. The love interest in this movie, never very satisfying even in the first part, just peters away in the second half.This is certainly worth watching, but I found it less involving after the protagonist left Morocco</review>

And a solution, ecentric at the first sigh, painfull and degradating at whole, but the only option. Siberian atmosphere, admirable acting - especially Evgeny Tsiganov, wise use of silence and fresco of a very tough way. In essence a magic - Christian story about the solution against fate and the others</review>

 --- Review: It seems a parable. A man too close by his death. A woman telling to him a tale. And a solution, ecentric at the first sigh, painfull and degradating at whole, but the only option. Siberian atmosphere, admirable acting - especially Evgeny Tsiganov, wise use of silence and fresco of a very tough way. In essence a magic - Christian story about the solution against fate and the others
 --- Viewers reactions: the goose in dust ... very brave and successful</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Rizsard Kapuscinsky is one of the most important reporters of the XX Century, and someone who witnessed some of the biggest war crimes in Europe, Latin America and Africa. His books and reportages are ineludible documents to understand all the interests behind war, invasions and geopolitics. It is not surprise that any American viewer say nothing about this animated documentary. It is very probably that American audiences doesn't like at all what Kapuscinski has written, and the way he is portrayed on here. Very far from the way are portayed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate affair. In that case, there is no ideology. America film and history are made to believe that what both Washington Post reporters it is what investigative journalism is all about. This is, for say the least, an arrogant point of view. America is not the world, nor even the center of the word. Is one pole. The other is Russia, and the former USSR.This animated documentary involves both poles from the Cold War, and is not, and cannot be by any means precisely a fruit of objectivity. But, as Kapuscinski put it in many other of his reporter works, and is put it that way on here, his job is to give word to those are condemned to be forgotten, those who usually die amidst oblivion and never are listen, those who are needed and poor, just like Jesus say on his preach, which not means I compared Jesus with Kapuscinski.Animation is awesome on this documentary, the way are blended original footage and pictures of many of the depicted characters is just amazing, and shows how American power is capable of the worst atrocities only to support its foreing policy of destruction and empoverity entire countries. The Angola conflict is one of those defeites that American doesn't want to remember, after Vietnam. Of course, it would be naïve to consider that this documentary support openly Russian interventionism, since they abandon too Angola, only to see how Cuba took their place in the conflict and made it to succeed.There is no such a thing called neutral interventionism, but Kapuscinski knows that he has to be the voice of those who hasn't and seem condemned to be crashed by any outside political power. "This is the way I look" is a frase repeated several times in the documentary, as if little people raise his voice to be remeber in the future and not fall into oblivion. That's the very point on what Kapuscinski was doing all his life, and for that will be remembered as one of the biggest and more influential reporters of the last century.A very impressive documentary, a must see to unveil our prejudices about interventionism</review>

    <desc lang="pl">Meksyk, lata 20. XX wieku. Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek) od dzieciństwa cierpi na problemy zdrowotne. Gdy ma sześć lat, choruje na polio. Jako nastolatka uczestniczy w poważnym wypadku drogowym, w którym doznaje bardzo ciężkich obrażeń. W efekcie przez wiele miesięcy jest przykuta do łóżka. Z bólem będzie się jednak zmagać już do końca życia. Cierpienie i odosobnienie staje się dla niej inspiracją do tworzenia. Po okresie rekonwalescencji Frida pokazuje swoje prace słynnemu malarzowi, rewolucjoniście Diego Riverze (Alfred Molina), prosząc o ich ocenę. On jest pod dużym wrażeniem nie tylko malarstwa dziewczyny, ale także jej uroku i urody. Mimo różnicy wieku rodzi się między nimi płomienne uczucie. Pobierają się, choć artysta ma reputację kobieciarza. Liczne kochanki męża stają się elementem życia Fridy. Ona sama również nie stroni od romansów, także z kobietami. Kiedy jednak odkrywa, że Diego ma romans z jej ukochaną siostrą (Mía Maestro), żąda rozwodu. Niebawem mężczyzna znów pojawia się w jej życiu, prosząc o ważną przysługę. Scenariusz filmu powstał na podstawie biografii malarki autorstwa Haydena Herrery. O przeniesienie jej na ekran przez lata zabiegała również pochodząca z Meksyku Salma Hayek. Obraz został uhonorowany Oscarami za muzykę i charakteryzację.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Salma Hayek (uni-brow and all) gives a genuinely great performance as `Frida,' the Mexican artist who is more famous, perhaps, as the wife of Diego Rivera than as a painter in her own right - although Rivera himself always insisted that it was Frida who had the greater talent.Frida Kahlo was a woman who endured a life of crippling pain caused by a trolley accident in her youth, yet her innate energy, passion and love of life - as well as her enormous abilities as a painter - allowed her to overcome that daunting obstacle to achieve a measure of fame and recognition. What she was not quite so successful in overcoming was her strenuous love/hate relationship with Rivera, which came to occupy her time and her life almost as much as her painting. In many ways, `Frida' is a typical artist bio, highly reminiscent of other recent films in the genre such as `Pollock' and `Surviving Picasso,' both of which also dealt with the serial philandering of their male artist figures. `Frida,' however, since it is focused more intensely on the woman's perspective, offers a few new insights into that seemingly inevitable theme. Frida, in many ways, prides herself on her independent, fiery nature, yet when Rivera becomes a part of her life, she quickly succumbs to his seductive charms. She marries Rivera even though she knows he is constitutionally incapable of remaining faithful to her. Thus, she sets herself up for a life of misery with a man she is utterly incapable of living without. That the relationship is one of utter co-dependency is demonstrated by the fact that Rivera, even after their numerous breakups, keeps coming back to his one true love.Based on the Hayden Herrera biography, the Clancy Sigal/Diane Lake/Gregory Nava/Anna Thomas screenplay doesn't paint Frida as some sort of passive victim of her own weaknesses nor as some sort of plaster saint martyr who was entirely guiltless in her own troubled life. We see, for instance, the hypocrisy inherent in her own romantic dalliances, principally her bisexual flings with other women and even the affair she conducts with none other than Trotsky himself during the period of his exile in Mexico (right before his assassination). We empathize with Frida because she functions as such a compelling figure in the context of the story, but we are never allowed to forget that she is a flawed human being, as capable of making a mess of her life as any of the men who generally occupy the lead position in these stories.If for no other reason, `Frida' is worth seeing for the marvelous sense of history it provides, chronicling the turbulent period of the 1920's and 1930's when socialism was the `in' cause for the art world to rally around - at least until the arrival of Stalin when the pipe dream of a worker's state and a classless society fell victim to the murderous brutality of a regime more totalitarian in nature than the one it had replaced. Director Julie Taymor keeps the political issues of the era front and center, perfectly integrating them with the tumultuous relationship at the story's core. We witness, for instance, Rivera's struggle with Nelson Rockefeller when the latter commissions Rivera to paint a mural in one of his buildings. When Rockefeller, the personification of capitalism, balks at Rivera's glorification of Lenin in the painting, Rivera is forced to reexamine his own commitment to the cause he so vehemently espouses (the film makes an interesting companion piece to `The Cradle Will Rock' from a few years back). We also get to see some of the lip service paid by these artists to the socialist cause, as they live the good life among the elite pampered classes, often at the expense of the very workers whose rights they so loudly proclaim in their work.As Frida, Hayek literally carries the film. Tender and vulnerable one moment, she can become fiery and self-confident the next. Hayak also captures much of the excruciating physical torment that Frida was forced to endure during her lifetime - and which often became the central subject of much of her art. Alfred Molina makes of Rivera a fascinatingly understated figure. His seeming world-weariness camouflages a tenderness and ability to love deeply, which, apparently, few in his life - apart from Frida - were ever able to see. Ashley Judd does a nice turn as one of Rivera's socialite devotees and Antonio Banderas makes his mark in his very brief appearance as David Siqueiros, a passionate socialist who accuses Rivera of kowtowing to the powers-that-be whom he claims to despise (Banderas is so good in the role that one regrets he isn't given more screen time). Geoffrey Rush, unfortunately, is not given enough time or good material to make much of an impression as Trotsky.Taymor has had mixed results integrating Frida's works into the story. The director occasionally dabbles in surrealism by having Frida and Diego literally enter into the world of her paintings. Sometimes it works; sometimes it serves merely as a fancy distraction. Still, Taymor at least deserves credit for boldness in such scenes.All in all, `Frida' provides a fascinating portrait of its heroine - and one of the best performances of the year to go along with it</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: As a German born and socialized in the western part and having lived in the eastern part for more than 17years now, I feel like this is quite some masterpiece. One year after the initial theatre campaign many people seem to relate to the movie, as a concert of Gundermann's songs performerd by director Dresen and lead actor Scheer yesterday in Leipzig was sold out.The authentic interpretation of Gerhard Gundermanns poetic and mostly deep songs is the most fascinating part of the movie, closely followed by the makeup departments stunningly exact remodeling of Gundermann's face. Even his widow has said in interviews it was spooky to look into the face of her deceased husband just as she remembered it from 15 years ago.In fact both Dresen's singing and his looks are so close to the original that I have to listen closely when hearing a song from the movie to distinct it from one of the original works of the popular East German songwriter who as many had to find a way of dealing with the profound changes of 1990. the big turning point in Germany's most recent history.The film also achieves an unbiased perspective leaving it to the spectator to find a point of view towards Stasi activities and SED ideology. A fascinating and totally underrepresented movie on this platform. Just see for yourself</review>

    <desc lang="pl">Mieszkający na przedmieściach Bostonu dwudziestoletni Will Hunting (Matt Damon) jest sierotą. Przeżycia z dzieciństwa odcisnęły na nim swoje piętno, często popada więc w konflikty z prawem. Inteligentny i oczytany chłopak pracuje jako woźny na miejscowej uczelni. Wolny czas spędza głównie z przyjacielem Chuckiem (Ben Affleck). Pewnego razu rozwiązuje zapisane na tablicy w korytarzu szkoły zadanie matematyczne, z którym nie poradził sobie żaden student. Profesor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard) z zaskoczeniem odkrywa, że woźny jest matematycznym geniuszem. Tymczasem Will trafia do aresztu za udział w bójce. Profesor stara się mu pomóc. Na wstępie stawia jednak pewne warunki. Chłopak ma rozpocząć kurs matematyki oraz zacząć uczęszczać na sesje terapeutyczne. Will nie godzi się na spotkania z psychoanalitykiem. Profesor Lambeau prosi o pomoc swojego szkolnego kolegę, psychologa Seana Maguire'a (Robin Williams). Dochodzi do starcia dwóch silnych osobowości. Film okazał się wielkim sukcesem kasowym.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Sure, this film's plot is fairly predictable. Sure, if you boiled it down to its essential components it wouldn't amount to much. Sure, Will Hunting's genius is profoundly unrealistic.Yet I'm giving this one 10 out of 10.I don't know whether Matt and Ben have ever been in therapy, but they certainly understand a lot about the human psyche, how it ducks responsibility, and pushes blame onto others, how it dismisses the real gifts it has and concentrates on running itself down. How many of us suffer from the same problems as Will? Only those who deny their own vulnerability will remain unaffected by this film.Not only is the script powerful, but the dynamics between the characters - all of them selfish, even Skylar - is vividly and plausibly executed. The film just about manages to avoid easy answers, preferring to acknowledge (indeed, highlight) the complexity and pain of personal growth and self-realisation.You could read a lot of self-help books, but they won't bring across to you as powerfully as this film what it's like to be scared, what it's like to experience loss, how difficult it is to shake off your old ways of thinking, how important honesty to yourself is. If this is the kind of revelation Matt and Ben are going to come up with, I look forward to their future efforts.The first time I saw it, I felt moved as the credits rolled. On my way home from the cinema, I felt sombre. When I got home, I finally burst into tears. This film burns slowly, inside you.As cinema, it's fair to middling. The performances are all first class.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Rizsard Kapuscinsky is one of the most important reporters of the XX Century, and someone who witnessed some of the biggest war crimes in Europe, Latin America and Africa. His books and reportages are ineludible documents to understand all the interests behind war, invasions and geopolitics. It is not surprise that any American viewer say nothing about this animated documentary. It is very probably that American audiences doesn't like at all what Kapuscinski has written, and the way he is portrayed on here. Very far from the way are portayed reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein on the Watergate affair. In that case, there is no ideology. America film and history are made to believe that what both Washington Post reporters it is what investigative journalism is all about. This is, for say the least, an arrogant point of view. America is not the world, nor even the center of the word. Is one pole. The other is Russia, and the former USSR.This animated documentary involves both poles from the Cold War, and is not, and cannot be by any means precisely a fruit of objectivity. But, as Kapuscinski put it in many other of his reporter works, and is put it that way on here, his job is to give word to those are condemned to be forgotten, those who usually die amidst oblivion and never are listen, those who are needed and poor, just like Jesus say on his preach, which not means I compared Jesus with Kapuscinski.Animation is awesome on this documentary, the way are blended original footage and pictures of many of the depicted characters is just amazing, and shows how American power is capable of the worst atrocities only to support its foreing policy of destruction and empoverity entire countries. The Angola conflict is one of those defeites that American doesn't want to remember, after Vietnam. Of course, it would be naïve to consider that this documentary support openly Russian interventionism, since they abandon too Angola, only to see how Cuba took their place in the conflict and made it to succeed.There is no such a thing called neutral interventionism, but Kapuscinski knows that he has to be the voice of those who hasn't and seem condemned to be crashed by any outside political power. "This is the way I look" is a frase repeated several times in the documentary, as if little people raise his voice to be remeber in the future and not fall into oblivion. That's the very point on what Kapuscinski was doing all his life, and for that will be remembered as one of the biggest and more influential reporters of the last century.A very impressive documentary, a must see to unveil our prejudices about interventionism</review>

    <title lang="pl">Frida</title>
    <desc lang="xx">Directed by Julie Taymor.  With Salma Hayek, Alfred Molina, Geoffrey Rush, Mía Maestro. A biography of artist Frida Kahlo, who channeled the pain of a crippling injury and her tempestuous marriage into her work.</desc>
    <desc lang="pl">Meksyk, lata 20. XX wieku. Frida Kahlo (Salma Hayek) od dzieciństwa cierpi na problemy zdrowotne. Gdy ma sześć lat, choruje na polio. Jako nastolatka uczestniczy w poważnym wypadku drogowym, w którym doznaje bardzo ciężkich obrażeń. W efekcie przez wiele miesięcy jest przykuta do łóżka. Z bólem będzie się jednak zmagać już do końca życia. Cierpienie i odosobnienie staje się dla niej inspiracją do tworzenia. Po okresie rekonwalescencji Frida pokazuje swoje prace słynnemu malarzowi, rewolucjoniście Diego Riverze (Alfred Molina), prosząc o ich ocenę. On jest pod dużym wrażeniem nie tylko malarstwa dziewczyny, ale także jej uroku i urody. Mimo różnicy wieku rodzi się między nimi płomienne uczucie. Pobierają się, choć artysta ma reputację kobieciarza. Liczne kochanki męża stają się elementem życia Fridy. Ona sama również nie stroni od romansów, także z kobietami. Kiedy jednak odkrywa, że Diego ma romans z jej ukochaną siostrą (Mía Maestro), żąda rozwodu. Niebawem mężczyzna znów pojawia się w jej życiu, prosząc o ważną przysługę. Scenariusz filmu powstał na podstawie biografii malarki autorstwa Haydena Herrery. O przeniesienie jej na ekran przez lata zabiegała również pochodząca z Meksyku Salma Hayek. Obraz został uhonorowany Oscarami za muzykę i charakteryzację.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Salma Hayek (uni-brow and all) gives a genuinely great performance as `Frida,' the Mexican artist who is more famous, perhaps, as the wife of Diego Rivera than as a painter in her own right - although Rivera himself always insisted that it was Frida who had the greater talent.Frida Kahlo was a woman who endured a life of crippling pain caused by a trolley accident in her youth, yet her innate energy, passion and love of life - as well as her enormous abilities as a painter - allowed her to overcome that daunting obstacle to achieve a measure of fame and recognition. What she was not quite so successful in overcoming was her strenuous love/hate relationship with Rivera, which came to occupy her time and her life almost as much as her painting. In many ways, `Frida' is a typical artist bio, highly reminiscent of other recent films in the genre such as `Pollock' and `Surviving Picasso,' both of which also dealt with the serial philandering of their male artist figures. `Frida,' however, since it is focused more intensely on the woman's perspective, offers a few new insights into that seemingly inevitable theme. Frida, in many ways, prides herself on her independent, fiery nature, yet when Rivera becomes a part of her life, she quickly succumbs to his seductive charms. She marries Rivera even though she knows he is constitutionally incapable of remaining faithful to her. Thus, she sets herself up for a life of misery with a man she is utterly incapable of living without. That the relationship is one of utter co-dependency is demonstrated by the fact that Rivera, even after their numerous breakups, keeps coming back to his one true love.Based on the Hayden Herrera biography, the Clancy Sigal/Diane Lake/Gregory Nava/Anna Thomas screenplay doesn't paint Frida as some sort of passive victim of her own weaknesses nor as some sort of plaster saint martyr who was entirely guiltless in her own troubled life. We see, for instance, the hypocrisy inherent in her own romantic dalliances, principally her bisexual flings with other women and even the affair she conducts with none other than Trotsky himself during the period of his exile in Mexico (right before his assassination). We empathize with Frida because she functions as such a compelling figure in the context of the story, but we are never allowed to forget that she is a flawed human being, as capable of making a mess of her life as any of the men who generally occupy the lead position in these stories.If for no other reason, `Frida' is worth seeing for the marvelous sense of history it provides, chronicling the turbulent period of the 1920's and 1930's when socialism was the `in' cause for the art world to rally around - at least until the arrival of Stalin when the pipe dream of a worker's state and a classless society fell victim to the murderous brutality of a regime more totalitarian in nature than the one it had replaced. Director Julie Taymor keeps the political issues of the era front and center, perfectly integrating them with the tumultuous relationship at the story's core. We witness, for instance, Rivera's struggle with Nelson Rockefeller when the latter commissions Rivera to paint a mural in one of his buildings. When Rockefeller, the personification of capitalism, balks at Rivera's glorification of Lenin in the painting, Rivera is forced to reexamine his own commitment to the cause he so vehemently espouses (the film makes an interesting companion piece to `The Cradle Will Rock' from a few years back). We also get to see some of the lip service paid by these artists to the socialist cause, as they live the good life among the elite pampered classes, often at the expense of the very workers whose rights they so loudly proclaim in their work.As Frida, Hayek literally carries the film. Tender and vulnerable one moment, she can become fiery and self-confident the next. Hayak also captures much of the excruciating physical torment that Frida was forced to endure during her lifetime - and which often became the central subject of much of her art. Alfred Molina makes of Rivera a fascinatingly understated figure. His seeming world-weariness camouflages a tenderness and ability to love deeply, which, apparently, few in his life - apart from Frida - were ever able to see. Ashley Judd does a nice turn as one of Rivera's socialite devotees and Antonio Banderas makes his mark in his very brief appearance as David Siqueiros, a passionate socialist who accuses Rivera of kowtowing to the powers-that-be whom he claims to despise (Banderas is so good in the role that one regrets he isn't given more screen time). Geoffrey Rush, unfortunately, is not given enough time or good material to make much of an impression as Trotsky.Taymor has had mixed results integrating Frida's works into the story. The director occasionally dabbles in surrealism by having Frida and Diego literally enter into the world of her paintings. Sometimes it works; sometimes it serves merely as a fancy distraction. Still, Taymor at least deserves credit for boldness in such scenes.All in all, `Frida' provides a fascinating portrait of its heroine - and one of the best performances of the year to go along with it</review>

Para ma dwie córki i oczekuje kolejnego dziecka. Oboje liczą na to, że będzie to syn, ponieważ lokalne prawo głosi, że jeśli nie doczekają się męskiego potomka, czeka ich eksmisja. Na przekór ogromnym nadziejom rodzi się trzecia córka. Małżonkowie są przerażeni i bliscy desperacji. Przyjaciółka Johanny, Livia (Livia Millhagen), dochodzi do wniosku, że brak męskiego potomka jest winą partnera. Według niej spłodzenie syna byłoby możliwe z innym mężczyzną. Esmar kurczowo łapie się tej myśli i wskazuje pewnego francuskiego kapitana. Żadne z nich nie ma pojęcia, z jakimi konsekwencjami tej decyzji przyjdzie im się zmierzyć...

    <review type="text">IMDb review: SPOILER: "But I can't forever carry them kids and my mom, not without that house."Winter's Bone is a stark, almost documentary-like movie about a poor teenage girl named Ree in the Ozarks who supports her near-catatonic mother and two younger siblings during her meth-cooking father's many brushes with the law. When he disappears before a court date and the family's home is at risk if he doesn't show up, Ree (Jennifer Lawrence) investigates amongst the locals to find out where he might be. But, some people don't like the questions she's asking, and her life may be at risk, along with her family home. The plain, unobtrusive way that the camera observes events really helped draw me into the movie, to the point where I honestly forgot that I was watching a movie, at all. This effect was heightened by some excellent performances; especially from Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes (Teardrop). Lawrence had a star-making (and award worthy) performance, in my opinion. Ree is probably my favorite movie character of the year (well, perhaps next to Hit Girl), and Lawrence plays her with a realism and stubborn toughness that makes you believe that this seventeen year-old girl wouldn't wilt under the kind of circumstances that would overwhelm most adults. Her love for her family seems completely genuine, and there's never a word or a glance where she seems like she's "acting".  It's all very natural, and I was beyond impressed.The plot was quite tense and engrossing, as Ree pursues the mystery of where her father is with a dogged intensity, despite the fact that it leads her into some very dangerous (and violent) situations. The sparse, beautiful winter settings are a perfect backdrop for the story. It's been a while since I've seen a movie that does as good a job as this one in communicating a sense of place.Winter's Bone may not be for everyone, though. There are no shoot-outs or florid romantic scenes. The moments of happiness are small, fleeting, and poignant; like a gift of generosity from a neighbor who knows you're in need, or the quiet assurances of an older sister to her younger siblings. In Winter's Bone, our world is never in danger...but one family's certainly is.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Bringing out the Dead, unfortunately, has fewer fans than it deserves. Why? Because this isn't simply a "New York" movie, or a movie about a paramedic, or about euthenasia, despite the ostensible setting and plot points.Instead, Scorsese has created a cinematic myth about how haunted modern existence can be, and what it takes to be "saved" and find grace in a seemingly godless world. His vision of New York is all literate existential comedy, not a window into the rotten Big Apple. Mere satiric commentary on the tragedy of life in New York is for journeyman directors; Scorsese is doing something else entirely here.In other words, this is that really rare beast--a literate film that is, first and foremost, still a great movie. In the plot and its implications, there's more here of Flannery O Conner or Virginia Woolf than there is here of, say, Tom Wolf. More pariticularly, Bringing out the Dead does with masterful filmmaking what Joyce's The Dead did in prose. This film is a truly eye-opening investigation into how the living exist in the shadow of the dead and dying.The film accomplishes this incredibly difficult task on many levels--the cinematography alone should give you a clue that this is definitely not Taxi Driver or Goodfellas--there's something more sublime here (the beauty that American Beauty explains wonderfully is shown everywhere in this film, but Bringing out the Dead is less mundane, simple and "character" oriented). Every shot is right, and the numerous computer effects here--on display almost for their own sake in The Matrix--are here poetically put together by a master director.So, just for it's approach to a subject that few movies or directors would even attempt, this film will be a classic. Oddly enough, one of the few movies it can be compared with is Hitchcock's Vertigo, which confronts the same issues in a different way. Scotty's (Jimmy Stewart) desire to "raise" the dead is as strong as Frank's, and audiences didn't much like Vertigo when it was released either.The acting, the music, the incredible photography--they're all great, if you realize you are watching a literate, funny, well-plotted (as opposed to simply plotted) meditation on the ghosts that increasingly inhabit our technocratic dwellings.Too good for a grade: see it on the biggest, best screen you can while you can.

 --- Description: Directed by Martin Scorsese.  With Nicolas Cage, Patricia Arquette, John Goodman, Ving Rhames. Haunted by the patients he failed to save, an extremely burned-out Manhattan ambulance paramedic fights to maintain his sanity over three fraught and turbulent nights. 
 --- Director: Martin Scorsese, Joe Connelly, Paul Schrader, JRoberts, A brilliant film
 --- Actors: Nicolas Cage (role=Frank Pierce), Patricia Arquette (role=Mary Burke), John Goodman (role=Larry), Ving Rhames (role=Marcus), Tom Sizemore (role=Tom Wolls), Marc Anthony (role=Noel), Mary Beth Hurt (role=Nurse Constance), Cliff Curtis (role=Cy Coates), Nestor Serrano (role=Dr. Hazmat), Aida Turturro (role=Nurse Crupp), Sonja Sohn (role=Kanita), Cynthia Roman (role=Rose)
 --- Review: Bringing out the Dead, unfortunately, has fewer fans than it deserves. Why? Because this isn't simply a "New York" movie, or a movie about a paramedic, or about euthenasia, despite the ostensible setting and plot points.Instead, Scorsese has created a cinematic myth about how haunted modern existence can be, and what it takes to be "saved" and find grace in a seemingly godless world. His vision of New York is all literate existential comedy, not a window into the rotten Big Apple. Mere satiric commentary on the tragedy of life in New York is for journeyman directors; Scorsese is doing something else entirely here.In other words, this is that really rare beast--a literate film that is, first and foremost, still a great movie. In the plot and its implications, there's more here of Flannery O Conner or Virginia Woolf than there is here of, say, Tom Wolf. More pariticularly, Bringing out the Dead does with masterful filmmaking what Joyce's The Dead did in prose. This film is a truly eye-opening investigation into how the living exist in the shadow of the dead and dying.The film accomplishes this incredibly difficult task on many levels--the cinematography alone should give you a clue that this is definitely not Taxi Driver or Goodfellas--there's something more sublime here (the beauty that American Beauty explains wonderfully is shown everywhere in this film, but Bringing out the Dead is less mundane, simple and "character" oriented). Every shot is right, and the numerous computer effects here--on display almost for their own sake in The Matrix--are here poetically put together by a master director.So, just for it's approach to a subject that few movies or directors would even attempt, this film will be a classic. Oddly enough, one of the few movies it can be compared with is Hitchcock's Vertigo, which confronts the same issues in a different way. Scotty's (Jimmy Stewart) desire to "raise" the dead is as strong as Frank's, and audiences didn't much like Vertigo when it was released either.The acting, the music, the incredible photography--they're all great, if you realize you are watching a literate, funny, well-plotted (as opposed to simply plotted) meditation on the ghosts that increasingly inhabit our technocratic dwellings.Too good for a grade: see it on the biggest, best screen you can while you can. BTW--it's better the second time
 --- Viewers reactions: A brilliant film ... Hard To Watch, But Worth It ... A very under looked film ... Excellent movie ... Bringing Out the Dead is another Scorsese Masterpiece</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: This film is much better than it has any right to be and that all comes from writing and characterisation. They clearly didn't have the budget or time to put together something truly polished, but what they made is pretty much better than many horrors out there today.The fact that you actually care about the characters and what happens to them is remarkable, and it doesn't have to rely on a crazy villain or nudity to get your attention. The dialogue is immature, but it is meant to be, seeing as how the leads are all adolescents. The only real downside is the pacing and editing as both are a little jarring and detract from the overall quality of the production.Overall I would definitely recommend this movie to any comedy horror fan.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: A box office phenomenon at the time (this was one of those movie that people reportedly waited in line for hours to see), LOVE STORY has continued to be ridiculed by cynics and adored by romantics for decades. The secret to the film's ultimate effectiveness is in it's simplicity. Director Arthur Hiller wisely films Eric Segal's screenplay (an adaptation of his own best-selling novel) in a concise and straightforward manner, allowing audiences to become enamored with the characters and involved with their plight. The film even manages to make subtle commentary on class struggles, personal identity, and even the changing attitudes of religion, all of which while never appearing preachy or obvious under Hiller's unpretentious direction.Ali MacGraw brings an undeniable spunk to her characterization here which helps undercut the potential sentimentality of the picture, and lends the finale a greater emotional punch. The natural handsomeness and effortless charm of Ryan O'Neal is used to exceptional effect, and the supporting performances of Ray Milland and John Marley (as two very different types of fathers) are terrific. This is a film that never attempts to disguise it's own thematic manipulations, which may very be why it remains so effective.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I guess I'll be the first with a negative review for this movie. Scoring this movie with the highest score possible is just ridiculous. A perfect ten means to me that you could watch this movie over and over without being bored so I challenge everybody that scored it with a ten to watch it three times in a row. It's a movie you just watch once and than forget everything about it within the week. There are some 'good' scenes, mostly music scenes, where I smiled but overal it's just not worth your time. The acting wasn't that great either. It's low budget and it just shows</review>

    <desc lang="pl">Koniec XIX wieku. Esmar (Rudi Köhnke) i Johanna (Vigdis Hentze Olsen) to małżeństwo mieszkające na dzierżawionej farmie gdzieś na smaganych wiatrem klifach Wysp Owczych. Para ma dwie córki i oczekuje kolejnego dziecka. Oboje liczą na to, że będzie to syn, ponieważ lokalne prawo głosi, że jeśli nie doczekają się męskiego potomka, czeka ich eksmisja. Na przekór ogromnym nadziejom rodzi się trzecia córka. Małżonkowie są przerażeni i bliscy desperacji. Przyjaciółka Johanny, Livia (Livia Millhagen), dochodzi do wniosku, że brak męskiego potomka jest winą partnera. Według niej spłodzenie syna byłoby możliwe z innym mężczyzną. Esmar kurczowo łapie się tej myśli i wskazuje pewnego francuskiego kapitana. Żadne z nich nie ma pojęcia, z jakimi konsekwencjami tej decyzji przyjdzie im się zmierzyć...

Their solution is to get it with another man, which sets the stage for a package full of drama in the years following.The messages this film conveys are very effective and thought through (especially the symbolism regarding the titular birds), and the sense that family is something you choose rather than neccesarily those you are born with is ever present. The cast is amazing (evident by its Swedish Guldbagge nomination), and you really feel for the characters in this movie, no matter which side of a particular conflict they are on - it is truly a fantasticly written feature.The twists and turns are endless, and Richard Hobert, who has already proven himself a great director in the past, once again nails it and shows that he is able to pick up in the Nordic relationship genre that Ingmar Bergman experted in before him.It is a story that should be experienced for yourself, and I can't recommend it enough!I give it a 9 out of 10</review>

    <desc lang="pl">Potężna eksplozja wstrząsa Baltimore podczas rozgrywek futbolowej superligi. Wkrótce okazuje się, że to zamach, którego celem są nie tylko Stany Zjednoczone, ale bezpieczeństwo całego świata. Brytyjski arystokrata Richard Dressler (Alan Bates), przywódca neonazistowskiej organizacji, postanowił doprowadzić do wybuchu trzeciej wojny światowej, prowokując konflikt pomiędzy USA a Rosją. Amerykanie są zdezorientowani. Tymczasem w Rosji następuje nieoczekiwana zmiana polityczna - dotychczasowy prezydent ustępuje, a jego miejsce zajmuje nieznany szerzej polityk Nemerov (Ciarán Hinds). Jedyną osobą, która od początku śledzi jego polityczną karierę jest pracujący dla CIA historyk i analityk Jack Ryan (Ben Affleck). Razem z dyrektorem CIA Williamem Cabotem (Morgan Freeman) i grupą ekspertów jedzie do Moskwy. Niestety, rozmowy z rosyjskim prezydentem nie przynoszą oczekiwanych rezultatów. Amerykańscy politycy, w tym i sam prezydent (James Cromwell), są przekonani, że Rosja będzie dążyć do otwartego konfliktu z Ameryką. Ryan stara się uspokoić wojenne nastroje i zabiega o to, aby nie ustał dialog między dwoma światowymi mocarstwami. Porozumienie między nimi jest jedyną nadzieją na uniknięcie światowego konfliktu. Tylko w ten sposób agenci mogą również pokonać niebezpiecznych terrorystów - grupę bezwzględnego Dresslera. Ekranizacja powieści mistrza sensacji Toma Clancy'ego.</desc>

IF... you are able to forget that you read a book by the same title who's author was the executive director of the film. If you are able to separate the two you will enjoy the film. I found that I was able to enjoy the film but had long discussions and was bothered by many inconsistencies from the book. The location of the action (Baltimore), the time (2002), the time the activity took place in Jack Ryan's life (early), the level of his position within the CIA (low), the lack of any other fears to sum up, all were very different from the book and while I was able to enjoy the film as I watched it is has been bothering me more as I reflect on it.So my recommendation is see the movie then read the book, I have found that to be true with most of Clancy's work.

I really felt for his character's situation it's not all laughs.FYI: to earlier comments that cataplexy doesn't cause narcolepsy,and that its a symptom. That was a mistake in the description that was corrected. In the movie they state that he has narcolepsy with cataplexy so it makes it clear that it is a symptom that not everyone with narcolepsy has and that it's not necessarily the same for everyone with the illness</review>

    <desc lang="pl">Mike (Tom Hanks) opowiada kilkuletnim synom o swoim smutnym dzieciństwie. Cofa się pamięcią do czasów, gdy był małym chłopcem. Mike (Elijah Wood) wraz z młodszym bratem Bobbym (Joseph Mazzello), matką Mary (Lorraine Bracco) i ojczymem, mechanikiem zwanym Kingiem (Adam Baldwin), przeprowadza się na przedmieścia. Dzieci poznają opowieść o odważnym chłopcu, Fisherze, który marzył o lataniu. Na znajdującym się w okolicy niewielkim lotnisku udało mu się na chwilę wznieść w powietrze na swoim rowerze. Choć przypłacił tę przygodę kalectwem, wśród okolicznych mieszkańców jego wyczyn stał się legendą. Tymczasem nadużywający alkoholu King często staje się agresywny i znęca się nad Bobbym. Nie mogąc znieść jego cierpienia, Mike obmyśla pewien plan. Zainspirowany historią Fischera wraz z bratem buduje samolot, mając nadzieję, że maszyna przeniesie Bobby'ego w bezpieczne miejsce.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: This bittersweet slice of magic realism had a checkered production history (director/writer replaced) and tanked at the box office, but it's a helluva film.Elijah Wood and Joseph Mazzello are pre-teen brothers whose flaky mom (Lorraine Bracco) shacks up with a mean-spirited alcoholic (Adam Baldwin). During his drinking bouts, Baldwin physically abuses Mazzello and manipulates him into remaining silent about his situation. But when Wood cottons on to what's happening, the boys put their heads together and hatch a fantastique solution to Mazzello's devastating dilemma.I love films that mix fantasy and dark reality. They are rarely successful financially ("Lawn Dogs" is a similar example), but they are usually original and intriguing.The drunk Baldwin is shot from a low, child's perspective and his head is deliberately lopped off below the top of frame. This device allows us to judge him purely by his actions and as a totally physicalized beast. Both Wood and Mazzello are excellent, and they pull us effortlessly into their dark, frightening world.The "radio flyer" of the title is a small red wagon kids transport their belongings in. Here it transports a dream.Seriously interesting stuff</review>

    <desc lang="pl">Łowca skarbów przeszukuje wrak "Titanica", chcąc odnaleźć bezcenny brylant zwany "Sercem Oceanu". W spoczywającym na dnie morza sejfie natrafia jedynie na szkic przedstawiający dziewczynę, która ma na sobie naszyjnik z tym klejnotem. Informacja o tym dociera do wiekowej Rose Dawson Calvert (Gloria Stuart), która rozpoznaje siebie na rysunku. Kontaktuje się z poszukiwaczami i opowiada im swoją historię. W 1912 roku płynęła liniowcem jako 17-letnia dziewczyna - Rose Dewitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), wraz z matką (Frances Fisher) i swoim narzeczonym, bogatym Calem Hockleyem (Billy Zane). Znudzona towarzystwem ludzi z wyższych sfer, z przyjemnością spędza czas z podróżującym trzecią klasą Jackiem Dawsonem (Leonardo DiCaprio). Nowy znajomy nie podoba się matce dziewczyny ani jej przyszłemu mężowi. Rose zaś widzi dzięki niemu, że tkwi w skostniałym świecie konwenansów. Rodzi się między nimi prawdziwe uczucie. Tymczasem w nocy załoga spostrzega w małej odległości ogromną górę lodową. Jest jednak zbyt późno na ominięcie jej. Dochodzi do tragedii - "Titanic" zaczyna tonąć, a łodzie ratunkowe mogą pomieścić tylko część pasażerów... Wielkie widowisko filmowe, oszałamiające swym rozmachem. Jedno z najbardziej kasowych dzieł w historii kina, nagrodzone 11 Oscarami.</desc>

Fernando i jego przyszły zięć chcą ratować zakład i proszą o wsparcie finansowe zamożną rodzinę Solara. Dodatkowe fundusze umożliwiłyby im bowiem lepszy kolportaż. Solarowie wyrażają zgodę na pomoc, lecz z jednym zastrzeżeniem: Silvio ma być świadkiem na ślubie Lili. Przyszła panna młoda ani myśli do tego dopuścić, jednak Elena interweniuje i para ustala, że Silvio może pełnić funkcję świadka, o ile tylko Marcello nie przybędzie na ślub. Nino prosi Elenę, by napisała artykuł, ale ten nie zostaje opublikowany, co sprawia, że dziewczyna czuje się rozczarowana. Na przyjęciu Lili i Stefano nagle nieoczekiwanie pojawia się Marcello.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: As a standalone film this was funny and nice to look at, but as a sequel it was terrible. Thus overall it was average. Wreck it Ralph is one of my favorite animated films - it managed to be an homage to retro gaming whilst telling a story about a misguided but loveable 'bad guy' finding out what really matters in life.Ralph Breaks The Internet undoes all the good the first one did - Ralph is now an abusive (or should I say 'insecure') friend who has not one, but TWO cliche 'We were best friends and everything was perfect but now you did something that's upset me so I'm going to walk away and DON'T FOLLOW ME moments'. The film lacks any subtletly in dealing with its themes of toxic relationships (both personal and over the internet), and is far more comfortable in its amusing Internet references than it is in trying to make a statement.There were so many missed opportunities to link it with the first film. For example, it is made clear that the allure of modern games is that they're constantly being updated and feel new. This was the perfect chance for the film to show that retro games, that always stay the same and live in our memory, have merit too. But nope, that didn't happen. To me, it feels like a Disney exec wanted to tell a story of the dangers / joys of the internet, and the dangers / joys of clingy friendships, but forced these messages into Wreck it Ralph where it just doesn't fit. It's used as a vehicle for this message, weaving its way around a bombardment of internet references in trying to do so.I can understand why people enjoyed it - I laughed a lot during the first half, and one or two of the emotional moments were quite powerful. But in lacking any nuance or any reverence to the first film, I cannot recommend it to fans of the first</review>

    <title lang="xx">My Extraordinary Summer with Tess</title>
    <title lang="pl">Niezwykłe lato z Tess</title>
    <desc lang="xx">Directed by Steven Wouterlood.  With Sonny Coops Van Utteren, Josephine Arendsen, Julian Ras, Tjebbo Gerritsma. On a family vacation at the beach, Sam meets Tess, who carries her own secrets around with her and shows him how the present moment can win out over memories and anxiety about what's yet to come.</desc>
    <desc lang="pl">Wakacje dziesięcioletniego Sama (Sonny Coops Van Utteren) i jego rodziny zapowiadają się wyśmienicie. Holenderska wyspa, pełne złotego piasku plaże, kąpiele w morzu - niczego więcej chłopiec nie pragnie. Wyjazd szybko jednak zaczyna odbiegać od wyobrażeń. Starszy brat Sama, Jorre (Julian Ras), pierwszego dnia łamie nogę. Z kolei jego matka (Suzan Boogaerdt) cierpi na migreny, a ojciec (Tjebbo Gerritsma) nie radzi sobie z zapewnieniem młodszemu synowi ciekawych rozrywek. Chłopiec tymczasem dochodzi do wniosku, że przecież prawdopodobnie przeżyje swoich bliskich, więc dobrze poćwiczyć życie w pojedynkę. Rozpoczyna więc "treningi samotności". Wtedy poznaje jednak Tess (Josephine Arendsen). Ekscentryczna jedenastolatka ma mnóstwo szalonych pomysłów i wciąga w nie nowego kolegę, zapewniając im obojgu lato pełne przygód.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Południowa Afryka, rok 1978. Dwóch członków obalonego Afrykańskiego Kongresu Narodowego, Tim Jenkin (Daniel Radcliffe) i Stephen Lee (Daniel Webber), trafia do aresztu. Zarzuca im się działalność przeciwko apartheidowi. Obaj zostają skazani na wieloletnie więzienie i skierowani do zakładu karnego o maksymalnym rygorze w Pretorii. Na miejscu są brutalnie traktowani przez strażników i wkrótce orientują się, że jedyny sposób na przeżycie to ucieczka. Z pomocą innych więźniów zaczynają obmyślać plan wydostania się z więzienia. Jenkin dochodzi do wniosku, że muszą skopiować klucze otwierające zamki w całym budynku. Do swojej dyspozycji ma jednak wyłącznie drewno, a ryzyko, że wszystko się wyda, jest ogromne. Debiut reżyserski Francisa Annana przedstawia prawdziwą historię. W opracowaniu scenariusza pomagał sam Tim Jenkin.</desc>

Aspiring musician Miguel, confronted with his family's ancestral ban on music, enters the Land of the Dead to find his great-great-grandfather, a legendary singer.</desc>
    <desc lang="pl">W Meksyku trwa Dzień Zmarłych. Dwunastoletni Miguel marzy o karierze muzyka, lecz bliscy zakazują mu grania. Oczekują, że zgodnie z rodzinną tradycją będzie pracował w stworzonej przez prababcię firmie obuwniczej. Rozdarty między pasją a ich żądaniami chłopak postanawia wziąć udział w konkursie talentów. Kradnie gitarę z grobu swojego idola, Ernesta de la Cruza, i za karę trafia do królestwa zmarłych. Odkrywa, że czas płynie tu nieco inaczej, a egzystencja mieszkańców krainy jest spleciona ze światem żywych - prowadzą ją, dopóki trwa pamięć o nich, a obrzędy są kultywowane. Kiedy jednak tradycja zostanie zapomniana, zmarły umrze na zawsze. Miguel, bogatszy o tę wiedzę i nowe doświadczenia, próbuje wrócić do dawnego życia i rodziny. Lekka i inteligentna opowieść podejmująca trudne tematy dla młodszych i starszych widzów. Nagrodzono ją dwoma Oscarami: dla najlepszego długometrażowego filmu animowanego 2018 oraz za najlepszą piosenkę, "Remember Me" w wykonaniu amerykańskiego wokalisty Miguela i meksykańskiej piosenkarki Natalii Lafourcade. Swoich głosów w polskiej wersji językowej bohaterom użyczyli m.in. Agata Kulesza, Maciej Stuhr oraz Bartosz Opania.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Truly an awful film. Scraps literally all the charm and myth of the book and misses every mark that would be necessary for even a decent film. The tone is confused, the scene direction is 10/10 for cringe. All those years of Shakespearean study and practice was a waste of time Kennith? Clearly.Packed with all the muddled and addled virtue signalling nonsense that you could ever need. It not only defuses any sincerity about the characters but also manages to destroy any possible tension. We seem to be in a place in film making where it is taboo and forbidden for anyone to represent negative qualities of any kind. Everyone is good and nice to each other except for characters hidden in cloaks or the colonial British man.Josh Gads narration is not only entirely unnecessary but delivered like a high school students first assessment project.Holly is wrecked. Root is wrecked. Foaley is nothing. Mulch is intolerable. Butler is wrecked. Juliet is nothing.0 tension. 0 nuance. 0 technique.It may be the worst adaption of a book I've ever seen.

We seem to be in a place in film making where it is taboo and forbidden for anyone to represent negative qualities of any kind. Everyone is good and nice to each other except for characters hidden in cloaks or the colonial British man.Josh Gads narration is not only entirely unnecessary but delivered like a high school students first assessment project.Holly is wrecked. Root is wrecked. Foaley is nothing. Mulch is intolerable. Butler is wrecked. Juliet is nothing.0 tension. 0 nuance. 0 technique.It may be the worst adaption of a book I've ever seen. Definitely at least in the top 5
 --- Viewers reactions: One of the worst films I've ever seen ... I didn't read the books, my wife did, we were both lost ... Disney managed to make something worse than Wrinkle in Time ... By Far The Worst Spy Kids Movie ... A Nonsensical and Boring Waste of Time</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: My mother was born in Slovakia and I grew up on stories. How beautiful her village was, of course. But stories of overwhelming ugliness, too. Munich, like Yalta, was an obscene word in our household. In 1938, long after Hitler had revealed that he was a rabid dog needing to be put down, the West surrendered Czechoslovakia to Hitler without firing one bullet. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, the man with an umbrella, called the Munich agreement "peace for our time." One of the many reasons so few Eastern Europeans are Anglophiles. My mother taught me about Lidice, a Czech village that, with its inhabitants, had been wiped off the face of the earth by the Nazis. The men shot, the women and children murdered more slowly, the houses razed to the ground. In fact the Nazis wiped out hundreds of villages in Poland and Czechoslovakia. "Anthropoid" is a Hollywood movie that, at long last, tells some of the war from the point of view of desperate Czechs and Slovaks fighting the Nazis. Fanboys gripe, "How many World War II movies can you make?" One answer: chronicling of World War II will not be complete as long as major stories like Operation Anthropoid remain untold. Reinhard Heydrich was one of the worst human beings who ever lived. He chaired the Wannsee Conference that formalized the Final Solution, the Nazi plan to murder all Jews. He was also in charge of the Czech Republic. He brutalized the population and wiped out the resistance in short order. Heydrich was the only top Nazi to be assassinated, although there were assassination plots against others, significantly Hitler himself. People need to know that non-Jews, as well as Jews, suffered under the Nazis. People need to know of the incredible courage and heroism of forgotten heroes who fought the Nazis. The questions of an operation like Anthropoid remain open. Is it ethical, and is it militarily strategic, to assassinate one of history's worst humans if you know that thousands of innocent people will be murdered in retaliation? "Anthropoid" opens with two resistance fighers, Jan Kubis a Czech (Jamie Dornan) and Jozef Gabcik, a Slovak (Cillian Murphy), being parachuted into Czechoslovakia after their training in England. They must find the tiny remnants of the surviving underground and announce their assassination plan. Resistance members Ladislav Vanek (Marcin Dorocinski) and Uncle Hajsky (Toby Jones) are not immediately enthusiastic. They recognize the risks of retaliatory mass killings. They understand that this assassination may be more of a means of bringing respect to the Czechoslovak government in exile in London under Edvard Benes. "Anthropoid" is a tense, gripping, film noir-ish film. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I cried at the end. For hours afterward I was haunted by the film. It's not for nothing that Steven Spielberg chose to make a glamorous, powerful, heroic, high-living member of the Nazi party the subject of his "Schindler's List." It's hard for a storyteller to tell the audience a story that has no triumphant moments, lots of death, and an ending that most filmgoers will already know. "Anthropoid" consists largely of very tight shots on the faces of its two assassins as they live in Nazi-occupied Prague, trying to figure out a way to fulfill their mission. Scenes are dimly lit. Everyone is tense. There is little laughter or smiling. There is zero swaggering. There is a very brief moment toward the end that offers a hint of redemption. If you see the film, you will know what I'm talking about. The scene involves water, light, and a beautiful woman reaching out her hand. The film does not take in the grand sweep of history. There are no shots of London headquarters, no fetishizing of squeaky Nazi boots or Hugo Boss uniforms. Lidice is mentioned in such an understated manner that filmgoers unfamiliar with it won't know what has been said. "Anthropoid" offers an almost documentary look at what it is to be an assassin in a totalitarian regime. It's not fun. I was at first dubious when I heard that Cillian Murphy would be playing Jozef Gabcik. I wished for a Slovak actor. Murphy's performance is the emotional and aesthetic heart of the film. Murphy rarely allows any emotion to register on his face. He has turned himself into a killing machine. When, at a certain moment, a tear falls from his eye, that tear carries great weight. The audience knows what a courageous professional this man is.My mother told me about Jan Kubis and Jozef Gabcik. When I have gone through tough times in my own life, I have used men like them to inspire me. How can I complain, when they went through so much worse? How can I give up, when they never did, through a six-hour shootout with Nazis who massively outgunned and outmanned them? How can I fail to take risks to fight evil, when a Slovak just like me managed to send to hell a man who seems to have emerged from its most fetid depths? "Anthropoid" is not a fun movie, but I'm glad I saw it. It brings me closer to the heroes it honors</review>

 --- Review: My mother was born in Slovakia and I grew up on stories. How beautiful her village was, of course. But stories of overwhelming ugliness, too. Munich, like Yalta, was an obscene word in our household. In 1938, long after Hitler had revealed that he was a rabid dog needing to be put down, the West surrendered Czechoslovakia to Hitler without firing one bullet. British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, the man with an umbrella, called the Munich agreement "peace for our time." One of the many reasons so few Eastern Europeans are Anglophiles. My mother taught me about Lidice, a Czech village that, with its inhabitants, had been wiped off the face of the earth by the Nazis. The men shot, the women and children murdered more slowly, the houses razed to the ground. In fact the Nazis wiped out hundreds of villages in Poland and Czechoslovakia. "Anthropoid" is a Hollywood movie that, at long last, tells some of the war from the point of view of desperate Czechs and Slovaks fighting the Nazis. Fanboys gripe, "How many World War II movies can you make?" One answer: chronicling of World War II will not be complete as long as major stories like Operation Anthropoid remain untold. Reinhard Heydrich was one of the worst human beings who ever lived. He chaired the Wannsee Conference that formalized the Final Solution, the Nazi plan to murder all Jews. He was also in charge of the Czech Republic. He brutalized the population and wiped out the resistance in short order. Heydrich was the only top Nazi to be assassinated, although there were assassination plots against others, significantly Hitler himself. People need to know that non-Jews, as well as Jews, suffered under the Nazis. People need to know of the incredible courage and heroism of forgotten heroes who fought the Nazis. The questions of an operation like Anthropoid remain open. Is it ethical, and is it militarily strategic, to assassinate one of history's worst humans if you know that thousands of innocent people will be murdered in retaliation? "Anthropoid" opens with two resistance fighers, Jan Kubis a Czech (Jamie Dornan) and Jozef Gabcik, a Slovak (Cillian Murphy), being parachuted into Czechoslovakia after their training in England. They must find the tiny remnants of the surviving underground and announce their assassination plan. Resistance members Ladislav Vanek (Marcin Dorocinski) and Uncle Hajsky (Toby Jones) are not immediately enthusiastic. They recognize the risks of retaliatory mass killings. They understand that this assassination may be more of a means of bringing respect to the Czechoslovak government in exile in London under Edvard Benes. "Anthropoid" is a tense, gripping, film noir-ish film. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and I cried at the end. For hours afterward I was haunted by the film. It's not for nothing that Steven Spielberg chose to make a glamorous, powerful, heroic, high-living member of the Nazi party the subject of his "Schindler's List." It's hard for a storyteller to tell the audience a story that has no triumphant moments, lots of death, and an ending that most filmgoers will already know. "Anthropoid" consists largely of very tight shots on the faces of its two assassins as they live in Nazi-occupied Prague, trying to figure out a way to fulfill their mission. Scenes are dimly lit. Everyone is tense. There is little laughter or smiling. There is zero swaggering. There is a very brief moment toward the end that offers a hint of redemption. If you see the film, you will know what I'm talking about. The scene involves water, light, and a beautiful woman reaching out her hand. The film does not take in the grand sweep of history. There are no shots of London headquarters, no fetishizing of squeaky Nazi boots or Hugo Boss uniforms. Lidice is mentioned in such an understated manner that filmgoers unfamiliar with it won't know what has been said. "Anthropoid" offers an almost documentary look at what it is to be an assassin in a totalitarian regime. It's not fun. I was at first dubious when I heard that Cillian Murphy would be playing Jozef Gabcik. I wished for a Slovak actor. Murphy's performance is the emotional and aesthetic heart of the film. Murphy rarely allows any emotion to register on his face. He has turned himself into a killing machine. When, at a certain moment, a tear falls from his eye, that tear carries great weight. The audience knows what a courageous professional this man is.My mother told me about Jan Kubis and Jozef Gabcik. When I have gone through tough times in my own life, I have used men like them to inspire me. How can I complain, when they went through so much worse? How can I give up, when they never did, through a six-hour shootout with Nazis who massively outgunned and outmanned them? How can I fail to take risks to fight evil, when a Slovak just like me managed to send to hell a man who seems to have emerged from its most fetid depths? "Anthropoid" is not a fun movie, but I'm glad I saw it. It brings me closer to the heroes it honors
 --- Viewers reactions: A Tough Film I'm Glad I Saw ... Anthropoid is one of those rare thrillers that actually educates viewers. ... Fantastic ... The best cinematic account of this historic event ... Antedote to overblown special effects films</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: It's a pity this movie failed at the box office, because in my opinion, it's really good. It combines combines the classic dystopic sci-fi future with a scorched Earth, a few heroes struggling against enigmatic aliens and a corrupt military force, action style sequences that are at times quite intense, and the typical slow-paced Asian movie storytelling. Add to this a rich amount of influences from the FF games, including eight mysterious spirits that must be found in time or the heroine will succumb, as well as a lot of mythological references that must be taken for granted rather than analysed to bits if the viewer is to find any pleasure in this film.The trouble is that the FF video game fans wanted a story based on the games, or on their particular favourite in the series, and were disappointed with both the story, the setting and the characters. The average sci-fi movie fan, though, who ought to have loved the wicked general (excellently voice-cast by James Woods) and his huge space cannon, as well as the 'Aliens' styled surroundings and technology, was put off by all the talk about spirits and world souls. Leaving for a few of us who went to see the film with no real expectations, to enjoy it.Because it is a good film. The animation is, for the most part, excellent, even if some scenes have a too blatant 'look what we can do' boast to them. Particularly all the scenes of Aki's hair waving in the wind. Personally, I didn't think the story was either too slow-paced, nor too weird. It works well, especially if you like Asian movies. For the European and American market, though, there's probably not enough action and too much talking.If this movie had been released this year, it would probably have been given a better reception. The thought of fully computer animated films isn't as new and strange anymore, and with films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Ring and Hero, the west is opening up for the Asian way of telling stories. I hope to see more films like this, at least if they are this well made. 9/10</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: This biography soars toward the Academy Awards on the backs of its producer, director and actors. Kevin Kline proves you don't have to look like the "Real Person" to bring his spirit to life and Ashley Judd (contrary to some unfair and plain wrong reviews) gives us a strong Linda Porter, a complex and vulnerable Linda Porter who, as is usually the case, finally succumbs to her life choices with an uncommon grace and courage.Those people in the audience who had no idea about Mr. Porter's sexual preference, oh'd and ah'd in the beginning. Then they learned that all the talent in the world, all the money in the world, all the joyous hedonism of youth in the world - all of it falls in upon itself as age overcomes and destroys the arrogance of youth.Irwin Winkler has given us an unflinching portrait of an unusually talented man, an unusual life, and a painful end to that life.My palms were ice cold and I felt drained as this film concluded - not because it failed as a project, but because it succeeded so well.

    <title lang="pl">Ślicznotki</title>
    <desc lang="xx">Directed by Lorene Scafaria.  With Constance Wu, Jennifer Lopez, Julia Stiles, Mette Towley. Inspired by the viral New York Magazine article, Hustlers follows a crew of savvy former strip club employees who band together to turn the tables on their Wall Street clients.</desc>
    <desc lang="pl">Nowy Jork, 2008 rok. Destiny (Constance Wu) zaczyna pracę w nowojorskim nocnym klubie. W tajniki zawodu striptizerki wprowadza ją doświadczona koleżanka, Ramona (Jennifer Lopez), która jak nikt inny potrafi zawrócić mężczyznom w głowach. Pracownice klubu nagle boleśnie odczuwają ogólnoświatowy kryzys finansowy. Ich dochody maleją w zatrważającym tempie. Dobrze wiedzą, kogo powinny za to winić. Ich częstymi klientami są bankierzy z Wall Street, a to przecież właśnie krach na giełdzie zapoczątkował wszystkie problemy. Striptizerki zamierzają się zemścić, a przy okazji nieźle zarobić. Ramona obmyśla plan, jak dostać się do portfeli bogatych mężczyzn i wyczyścić je do ostatniego dolara. Scenariusz filmu bazuje na artykule "New York Magazine" przedstawiającym prawdziwą historię pracownic modnego klubu go-go. Dla Jennifer Lopez, choć jest doświadczoną tancerką, taniec na rurze okazał się prawdziwym wyzwaniem. Aktorka przyznała, że przypominało to bardziej akrobacje, a podczas nagrywania obawiała się, że spadnie i zrobi sobie krzywdę. W trakcie kręcenia zdjęć Constance Wu prawie skończyła ze złamanym nosem - Jennifer Lopez przypadkiem, wyrywając jej telefon, uderzyła ją w twarz. W dodatku stało się to dwa razy z rzędu.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: My primary thought is that I'm happy someone made a film that shines a spotlight on a very serious problem currently becoming more common amongst sex workers. As a sex worker myself, I am exposed to the perspectives and activities of a wide array of sex workers on a daily basis. I have observed an increasing amount of sex workers who feel validated in their decisions to become con-artists, bragging proudly about robbing their own clients. While I'm happy that this is starting to be discussed in the mainstream media, that doesn't mean it's a pleasant thing to observe. It's tragic that in an era when sex work does seem to be getting to a place where it's more openly accepted, we have unabashed behavior like this which is going to make people second guess any progress we may have established thus far - it's heavily counterproductive. Overall, the movie mostly just made me feel frustrated, sad, and worried for the future - but it was the correlation to reality that I couldn't get off of my mind. I wasn't very enveloped in the world of the film itself - mostly just reminded of my worries regarding the industry and the way it's pupils and society will carry on being effected by on another from here on out.As a film alone, it was okay. The performances were sufficient but nothing that stood out, which is more a result of the writing. Uninteresting characters caught up in uninteresting events. Overall, the plot FEELS like it should be entertaining, but the movie is a bit redundant - once you get into the thick of it, you're basically watching a repetitive cycle with not much movement to it. And as it goes on, you kind of like the characters less and less, with no real conflicting energies - so it kind of just gets worse as it goes. The movie could have use some cutting - there's not enough depth or complexity to it to validate a nearly 2 hour run time, unfortunately.The movie did have a handful of very amusing moments, but it was not enough to redeem the thing as a whole. It's not a bad movie, but it's also not a good movie..</review>

    <desc lang="xx">Directed by Edward Norton.  With Edward Norton, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Alec Baldwin, Willem Dafoe. In 1950s New York, a lonely private detective afflicted with Tourette's Syndrome ventures to solve the murder of his mentor and only friend.</desc>
    <desc lang="pl">Nowy Jork, rok 1957. Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton) zmaga się z zespołem Tourette'a, który utrudnia mu codzienne funkcjonowanie. Nerwowe tiki i niekontrolowane wypowiedzi zrażają do niego otoczenie. Jednocześnie przypadłość pozwala mu być świetnym detektywem. Dzięki niesamowitej przenikliwości, pamięci i kompulsywnej potrzebie doprowadzania spraw do końca mężczyzna odnosi sukcesy w śledztwach. Pewnego dnia jego przełożony i jednocześnie jedyny przyjaciel, Frank Minna (Bruce Willis), zostaje zamordowany. Lionel postanawia rozwiązać zagadkę jego śmierci na własną rękę, choć nie ma prawie żadnych wskazówek. Wszystkie ślady wiodą go prosto do ratusza. Szybko przekonuje się, że zbrodnia ma związek z planami zagospodarowania przestrzeni miejskiej, którymi zarządza inwestor Moses Randolph (Alec Baldwin). Detektyw odkrywa, że projekt jest elementem spisku i komuś bardzo zależało, by uciszyć jego szefa. Film inspirowany fabułą powieści Jonathana Lethema o tym samym tytule. Za reżyserię i scenariusz odpowiada odtwórca głównej roli, Edward Norton. By przekonująco odegrać postać cierpiącą na zespół Tourette'a, Norton przeczytał wiele książek i oglądał filmy dokumentalne na ten temat. Poznał także sporo osób z tym zaburzeniem.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Edward Norton, by most film fans, has been and will always be known as one of the best actors out there. Appearing in classics like Fight Club and more modern masterpieces like Birdman, he's never been one to pick a bad project on purpose. Motherless Brooklyn marks his latest leading role, while also directing and writing. As ambitious and difficult as that is, he has pulled it off quite well. Motherless Brooklyn is a very well-made period piece.Set in the 1950s, this film follows Lionel(Edward Norton) after the murder of his closest friend and colleague. Hellbent on discovering who the killer is, he finds himself on a paper trail across Brooklyn, never giving up on his plan. Being someone who also happens to suffer from Tourette Syndrome, he is a character that has a lot of depth to get behind. Personally, this particular character needed a great performance in order to be authentic, which is where this film shines the most.It's been a while since I've seen Edward Norton this committed to delivering a powerful performance. There are hardly any instances where he feels like he doesn't actually suffer from this condition. His devotion is what kept me engaged because the overall story does slightly meander at times. At nearly two and a half hours, this film can feel its length at times, but that's simply due to the fact that this movie cares about its characters and spends a lot of time on long conversations, some of which do lead to revelations though.Based on a book, this screenplay here definitely feels inspired and the voiceover work by Norton calms the viewers throughout, making for a sort of relaxing experience. In addition to that, the use of classical and jazz music is so much in the forefront that it nearly became a character of its own in the film. I really admired that aspect. Still, the overall movie doesn't leave too much for the audience to figure out, since the narration does lend a hand.In the end, Motherless Brooklyn is a really, really solid crime mystery that has the perfect setting and feel for this sort of premise. I found myself completely engrossed in this world and was eager to see where the movie ended up. Edward Norton gives an award-worthy performance and his direction only adds to that, making for a great overall movie. Motherless Brooklyn may be meant for a more mature audience as it is quite niche in terms of the nature of the story, which may lend itself better to an older crowd. Even so, I quite enjoyed myself</review>

    <title lang="pl">Cóż za piękny dzień</title>
    <desc lang="xx">Directed by Marielle Heller.  With Tom Hanks, Matthew Rhys, Chris Cooper, Susan Kelechi Watson. Based on the true story of a real-life friendship between Fred Rogers and journalist Lloyd Vogel.</desc>
    <desc lang="pl">Lloyd Vogel (Matthew Rhys) przeżywa kryzys. Nie układa mu się w małżeństwie z Andreą (Susan Kelechi Watson). Niedawno urodził mu się syn, a on nie do końca umie odnaleźć się w roli rodzica. Żona z kolei zupełnie straciła cierpliwość do jego humorów. Stresuje go też relacja z ojcem, Jerrym (Chris Cooper). Nie potrafi mu wybaczyć, że w przeszłości porzucił rodzinę i zostawił go samego ze schorowaną matką. W pracy też nie idzie najlepiej. Aspirujący do bycia dziennikarzem śledczym dostaje od przełożonej zadanie poniżej swoich umiejętności. Ma przygotować krótki artykuł w ramach cyklu opowiadającego o inspirujących osobach. Przychodzi mu przeprowadzić wywiad z uwielbianym w całym kraju gospodarzem programu dla dzieci, Fredem Rogersem (Tom Hanks). Bez jakiegokolwiek entuzjazmu spotyka się z ulubieńcem Ameryki, który od razu zaskakuje go pogodą ducha. Niespodziewanie role w ich relacji się odwracają. Podczas gdy to Lloyd miał przepytywać Rogersa, to ten nadaje kierunek rozmowie i skłania go do zwierzeń. Między mężczyznami nawiązuje się przyjaźń. Pod wpływem spotkań z Fredem Vogel na nowo odkrywa radość życia i zaczyna wierzyć, że może naprawić stosunki z bliskimi i zaznać szczęścia. Film inspirowany prawdziwą historią.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: This may get a little personal, but I've been suffering from severe depression and have had a lot of issues dealing with anger, sadness and all for about five years now. For the past 8 years of my life, and earlier years of my childhood, I have loved Fred Rogers. He always told me and millions of children all over the world that he likes us just the way we are, and taught us the power of kindness, positive ways of thinking and dealing with our emotions, and while I'll always be a cynic by nature, I've always tried to take what he taught me and many others to heart. He was genuinely the kindest, most loving and compassionate human being to ever grace this Earth. But over the past year especially, I've stopped caring about my life with tragedy happening around me constantly, making me feel like my life was falling apart, as well as me having thoughts of suicide. I always put Mr Rogers on to give me some kind of motivation to keep going, but his messages that once resonated so deeply with me began to fade as I slipped further and further away from being "fine". I've gotten a lot better over the past few months though, not perfect but still, and when I heard that a movie starring Tom Hanks as Mr Rogers was being made I did all that I could to see it as fast as possible when it finally came out in the UK (which as of writing this, was yesterday).The second this film started, the moment Hanks appeared and the music came on, I just completely melted. I almost audibly broke down into tears, but not with sadness, with joy and relief. I knew I was in for something that would grip me. This film is amazing. It focuses on the psychological healing and betterment of the protagonist, Lloyd, as Mr Rogers taps into his childhood and his feelings, the same way he tapped into the feelings of children back when his show was still on the air and back when I watched it a decade ago, and we get a powerful, touching tribute to this man and the impact he had on so many lives. Lloyd himself was not only well acted, but for me anyway I saw a bit of myself in him. Things like his strained relations with family, his overwhelming and blinding cynicism and his anger management are all things I dealt with at some point and still deal with today. So when the film took this character and and put him on this emotional journey to betterment and healing, it resonated so deeply with me that I began to feel as if I was a kid again, watching Rogers as he taught me how to deal with my own anger and to prioritise kindness, and for many people who saw this film, I feel like they experienced the same thing I did. And that's why this movie is so good. It has the same impact and kind-heartedness as Rogers' original show, but turned into an emotional, thoughtful and touching feature-length film that acts as the perfect tribute to Fred's legacy and life. At the end of the day though, the film, while an amazing tribute to Fred, isn't entirely about him. It's about how he saved the life of Lloyd, became one of his closest friends, and helped him heal his psychological wounds. And the perfect way to put this film is this: It's a film that celebrates the messages, kindness and life of Mr Rogers, that acts as a way to show the impact that he had on so many lives, and despite him not being in the film as much as Lloyd, who is the main protagonist of the film, his impact is felt throughout its entire runtime and in every single scene.Other things as well, the blending of the old Mr Rogers sets with locations in the film was very creative and touching, the acting, especially from Hanks was incredible, the film was perfectly paced and while the score isn't anything to talk about, the parts that do use music are done very well and capture the feel of the scene. The editing might've been a little iffy at points, but that was mainly at the beginning of the film. Overall, it's probably my favourite movie of 2019, even if I did have to wait until 2020 to watch it. If you have not watched it yet, please do. It's absolutely phenomenal</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Let me start off by saying that I am a big Harry Potter fan; I loved all 8 HP movies, and really liked the 1st installment of Newt's adventures as well.This movie just didn't really do the trick for me. There was absolutely nothing to complain about visually; the movie was even more stunning than the first one, with even more beautifully designed 'Beasts'. And as many other people have mentioned, as a Harry Potter fan, you just can't hate this movie. Where Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them only contained a handful amount of references to the Harry Potter series, The Crimes of Grindelwald has tonnes. Enough to hype up any Harry Potter fan.The problem this movie had for me was its plot, or rather, its almost nonexisting plot. This movie just seemed to serve as background information or something for the upcoming movies in this series (for which we'll undoubtedly have to wait another 2 years or more..), more of like a setup for things to come. It introduced many new characters and revealed certain things about already known characters. But yet, some of these things just felt unnatural, as if JK Rowling just kept writing more and more to squeeze into 1 movie. This basically leads to a movie where the biggest plot is to find Credence's 'true identity' - not really much of a plot at all. Some of the reveals about characters also seemed a bit strange, but that could be just me. All in all, all this dialogue about characters made it extra confusing to know what the movie was about, in addition to it lacking much of a plot to begin with.This movie is definitely not a waste of money or anything, you could just buy a ticket for the stunning scenes and you'd be satisfied. It's just that this movie was quite a disappointment compared to many people's expectations I think, seeing as it basically is just a setup for the upcoming movies, which lacks a good plot</review>

I don't know why, but the voters on this website always seem to hate comedies if they aren't from the hand of some cult-director. Does a movie always have to be a great drama or an exciting thriller? Not if you ask me, but I'm only one of many over here of course.It's true, the movie is a little chaotic from time to time. It isn't an overproduced Hollywood movie that takes itself too serious and that's exactly where its charm is in it for me. I loved to see Brad Pitt as the clumsy criminal who always is able to do something wrong. The same for Julia Roberts as his hysterical girlfriend and James Gandolfini as the gay hit man who has kidnapped her. I know, it's not done to say that you liked to see Julia Roberts play a certain role and Brad Pitt can never be good as a comical actor... Well, perhaps it is time for some people to broaden their minds. Don't believe what everybody says, watch it for yourself and form your own opinion. I liked it and I give it an 8/10</review>

I know, it's not done to say that you liked to see Julia Roberts play a certain role and Brad Pitt can never be good as a comical actor... Well, perhaps it is time for some people to broaden their minds. Don't believe what everybody says, watch it for yourself and form your own opinion. I liked it and I give it an 8/10
 --- Viewers reactions: I had a very good time watching this movie ... A chaotic, messy but brilliant commentary on relationships ... Black Comedy From Gore Verbinski ... Not as bad, as people say. ... Why am I the only one who liked it?</review>

    <desc lang="pl">Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey), 42-letni pracownik agencji reklamowej, przeżywa właśnie kryzys wieku średniego. Jest znudzony swoim dostatnim, lecz jałowym życiem. W końcu dochodzi do przekonania, że nie ma sensu dalej wieść takiej egzystencji. Nie jest zbyt szczęśliwy ze swoją żoną Carolyn (Annette Bening). Kobieta, choć wydaje się być osobą świadomie kształtującą swoje życie i żądną sukcesu, w głębi duszy także czuje pustkę i rozpacz. Ich córka Jane (Thora Birch), zakompleksiona nastolatka nieustannie pogrążona w depresji, nie potrafi porozumieć się z ojcem. Zarówno ona, jak jej matka uważają Lestera za kompletnego nieudacznika. Dziewczyna nie może znieść, że w domu pod pozorami idylli kryją się obojętność oraz obcość. Samopoczucia Jane nie jest w stanie poprawić nawet jej piękna przyjaciółka Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari), która pragnie zostać modelką. Dziewczyna robi duże wrażenie na Lesterze. Zauroczony Angelą, zaczyna on rozpaczliwie jej pożądać. Pod wpływem tego uczucia postanawia zmienić swoje życie. Błyskotliwy kinowy debiut Sama Mendesa uhonorowano pięcioma Oscarami w najważniejszych kategoriach: najlepszy film, reżyser, aktor pierwszoplanowy (Kevin Spacey), scenariusz oryginalny (Alan Ball) oraz zdjęcia (Conrad L.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: This is a great example of how a film can try to juggle and blend two different genres, and despite never really getting either perfect, can still offer up interesting and engaging drama. As a result, The Aftermath is far from a perfect film, and its frustrating misfocus given the potential of its historical setting makes for an often underwhelming watch. However, it still has the elegance, dramatic intrigue and often even emotion to keep you engaged throughout, ultimately making for a thoroughly watchable, but not exceptional, film.So, the two ideas and genres that the film attempts to balance and bring together are romantic drama and pure history, and it's the historical side that I'd like to start off with, because while the film features some fascinating historical themes, it also fails to capitalise on the genuinely enthralling potential of its setting.Set in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, the film centres on the relations and tensions between the British occupiers and local German citizens, with emotions and suspicion still running high following six years of all-out war. In that, the film looks at both the continuing negative feelings between both peoples, brought to life early on by Keira Knightley, as well as the idea that, with the war over, there is no need for recriminations in the face of a rebuilding project for the better of all, which we see in Jason Clarke's character early on.Now, while the movie does occasionally hit those beats in a little too on-the-nose (especially when compared with how the same ideas are presented in the brilliant Land Of Mine), it's not quite as clear-cut as you may expect. Subverting expectations by reversing the stereotypical roles and seeing the patriarch hold more sympathy to the Germans, with his wife holding onto more antagonistic feelings following the war, The Aftermath does offer up some genuinely intriguing historical discourse, which builds to fascinating and often even palpably tense heights towards the end of the first act.However, the biggest disappointment about this film is that it doesn't follow through. Despite a strong start from the historical point of view, its second and third acts don't offer all that much more on the same plain, with focus shifting abruptly to a romance that, while perfectly pleasant and enjoyable, just doesn't have the depth or intrigue to prove really impressive.Of course, that's not to say that the entire historical context goes out the window, and the romance that develops still focuses on the idea of relationships crossing political lines - similarly looked at in films like Suite Française. However, it's far closer to a generic period romance, rather than one that blends historical themes in to further what was developed earlier on.As a result, the film grinds to a little bit of underwhelming halt as it edges towards a rather predictable finale. It's not a boring watch, and with strong performances from Keira Knightley, Jason Clarke and Alexander Skarsgård, there is still intrigue and entertainment to find, but it all feels a rather frustrating and disappointing approach given the potential of the opening act's historical focus.If you're looking for a nice romantic drama, this film can prove an enjoyable watch, but you'll have to wait quite a while for the romance to start in earnest. On the flipside, if you're looking for a historical drama that depicts the aftermath of the Second World War (as I was), the film starts off in strong fashion, but its move towards romance later on will likely leave you disappointed</review>

Jego przyjaciel, Toni Katz (Matthias Schweighöfer), z kolei nie wyobraża sobie dnia bez swoich pigułek na porost włosów ani specjalnego ekspresu. Pewnego dnia uwielbiający rywalizację mężczyźni przystają na dość nietypowy zakład i w efekcie kończą bez ubrań w opustoszałym mieszkaniu. Postanowili na sto dni pozbyć się wszelkich gadżetów, urządzeń i innych przedmiotów. Każdego kolejnego dnia mogą odzyskać tylko jedną rzecz. To wyzwanie niesamowicie komplikuje im codzienne funkcjonowanie, ale zarówno Paul, jak i Toni jest zdeterminowani, by wygrać ze swoim przyjacielem.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: This movie is actually way more of a mix of comedy and "drama" than I expected. The cast is good and the main idea for the movie works nice. But I feel like this movie would be more fun if it chose one side. It should either be a comedy or a drama about consumerism.

It has hilarious humour and its almost an unique growth story of a man that has grown tired of his miserable life and finds something worth fighting for.The thing that bothers me is that some people criticize the film cause it has too bad language.

People are shocked if somebody swears or shows a breast in TV and after that they go see some idiotic TV series or action movie where they kill 1000 people and not even blink.Is the message "violence is OK, but sex/nudity and swearing is not" somehow logical?

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Nineteen ninety-nine was an outstanding year for adaptations of major literary works, but of all the great books that came to the screen last year, this is my favorite. John Irving's novel and adaptation is one of the most complete stories I can remember in many years. It is poignant, exhilarating, and astutely human in its scope, presenting a myriad of human emotions and experiences.Often, when a story attempts to cross genres so broadly, it fails from lack of depth or insufficiency of the writer or director to meet the variable demands of such a wide-ranging treatment. This film was a comedy, a tragedy, a romance, a human-interest story, a character study, and a period piece, and each element was excellently done.This was all accomplished without sacrificing the philosophical and emotional depth Irving imbues in all his works. Irving weaves a strong moral into this story; that rules need to be questioned and that being human is not so easily codified. He revisits this theme repeatedly, with each character facing dilemmas regarding societal and personal rules that are difficult to reconcile in the given situations.If there is one thing that stands out about this story, it is its human realism. These are ordinary people struggling with problems we all face. We come to have affection for almost all of them, and can identify with their tribulations. Although the story is excessively sentimental and fatalistic, it reminds us that life is complicated and doesn't always turn out the way we plan or hope. From a filmmaking perspective, we could not have asked more from Lasse Hallstrom. Known most in the U.S. for his direction of What's Eating Gilbert Grape', Hallstrom has been making wonderful films in Europe for almost twenty years. However, this film will certainly go down as his finest work. In the featurette on the DVD, he said that when he goes to Blockbuster with his daughter and sees it on the shelf, he will have a feeling of pride; and well he should.This motion picture was beautifully filmed with rich cinematography, breathtaking locations, and precise period props and costumes. However, the greatest achievement for Hallstrom, working in concert with Irving, was to orchestrate a large cast in such a way that no character seemed insignificant. Hallstrom took great care to do enough development of each character (often just visually without any dialogue) that he made us care for each of them. He gave the film an emotional depth and breadth that is difficult to achieve in two hours. His work with the children in the orphanage was superb, bringing forth their innocence and enthusiasm without minimizing their plight.The acting was uniformly outstanding. Tobey Maguire infused Homer with the right combination of idealism, naiveté and inner strength to make him an unassuming but powerful lead. Charlize Theron continues to impress me with her acting ability. Besides her enchanting girl-next-door attractiveness, she showed terrific range in a character that at first seemed shallow, but later proved to be quite complex.Michael Caine has had a legendary career spanning close to half a century. He has long been one of my favorite actors. His performance here was powerful and well deserving of the acclaim he received. Dr. Larch was an extremely complex character; egotistical, self-abusive, manipulative and recalcitrant, yet a saintly, self-sacrificing and loving crusader for the good of the children. Caine's ability to span that range was remarkable.Finally, I have the highest praise for Delroy Lindo as Mr. Rose, the orchard foreman. Lindo's bright smile and enthusiasm created a rock solid character with charm, strength and simple wisdom. He captures our admiration immediately, and despite his despicable act, we cannot help but pity him in the end.After having seen all the films that were nominated by the Academy for best picture last year, I have to say that this was my personal favorite. It wasn't as flashy as the rest; in fact, this was downright old fashioned in its approach. They just don't write stories like this anymore, and that's a shame. I rated it a 10/10. In its quiet way, it captured my heart</review>

    <desc lang="pl">XIX wiek. Charyzmatyczny i odważny sir Lionel Frost uważa się za najwybitniejszego na świecie tropiciela mitów i potworów. Problem w tym, że tylko on ma o sobie taką opinię. Przez otoczenie jest uznawany za dziwaka i szaleńca. Mimo to jego ambicją jest dołączenie do elitarnego londyńskiego klubu odkrywców. Tuż po tym, jak próba udowodnienia, że potwór z Loch Ness istnieje, kończy się fiaskiem, obieżyświat dostaje tajemniczy list, który daje nadzieję na odnalezienie osławionego Sasquatcha. Mimo szyderstw środowiska badaczy natychmiast wyrusza w dzikie rejony Ameryki Północnej, gdzie spotyka nadawcę wezwania - łagodnego i spragnionego towarzystwa poczciwca, który wyznaje, że prawdopodobnie jest ostatnim przedstawicielem swojego gatunku. Prosi Lionela o pomoc. Liczy bowiem, że podróżnik doprowadzi go do himalajskich yeti, których uważa za swoich kuzynów. Najpierw jednak muszą zdobyć wyjątkową mapę, która jest w rękach Adeliny Fortnight - niegdyś bliskiej Frostowi, obecnie mocno urażonej kobiety. Nakręcony w amerykańskim studiu LAIKA ("Koralina", "Kubo") czasochłonną techniką poklatkową film, który w dobie animacji komputerowej imponuje ręcznie wykonanymi modelami postaci oraz bogatą w detale scenografią.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Being a Dutchman living in Hamburg, I am not a big fan of German TV-Drama. In many cases it means strange and artificial dialogs, "overacting" and a lot of melodramatic scenes. Bad Banks however is a fantastic series, I am truly amazed how good this German production is. Everything seems to fit: the acting, the scenario, the story in itself, the production design. And what is best, is that they skipped the crazy German synchronisation and let the actors speak in their own mothertongue or dialect. This series is just as good as comparable English or American TV-drama, like recently Billions or (some years ago) Damages, both with similar topics in the financial world. Desiree Nosbusch is great, so is Paula Beer and of course Barry Atsma, with an intensity and authenticity that I have rarely seen before. A good thing that ZDF immediately offered all 6 episodes on their website, because you should simply enjoy a terrific series like this in one long session. 10 out of 10. Excellent</review>

    <desc lang="pl">Pies Piorun jest gwiazdą serialu telewizyjnego. Członkowie ekipy filmowej dbają jednak o to, by psiak wierzył w to, że wszystko, co dzieje się na planie, jest prawdą. W związku z tym Piorun uważa, że rzeczywiście posiada niezwykłe moce, które pomagają mu pokonać serialowych wrogów. Kiedy więc odegrana zostaje scena porwania Penny, jego właścicielki, pies jest przekonany, że została ona naprawdę uprowadzona. Ucieka więc ze studia filmowego z niezłomnym postanowieniem, aby jak najszybciej ją odnaleźć. Zderzenie z rzeczywistością okazuje się dla Pioruna bardzo blesne. Pies, który uważa, że jest superbohaterem, musi odnaleźć się w realich prawdziwego świata. Spieszący swojej pani na ratunek Piorun nie od razu jednak zdaje sobie sprawę, że jego niezwykłe moce zostały wymyślone przez scenarzystów. Wkrótce jednak dzięki pomocy dwójki nowo poznanych przyjaciół - kotki Marleny oraz chomika Attyli - przekonuje się, że można być prawdziwym bohaterem, nawet jeśli nie posiada się żadnych nadprzyrodzonych zdolności.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Its an animated movie about a dog. GIVEN, its a 'kids' movie. Unlike many animated movies, the dialog isn't full of innuendos or 'hidden' humor that only adults would 'get'. Its easily understood by kids, the animation is top-rate (as would be expected) and the characters are engaging and easy to enjoy. I admit that even though I love animation, I went to this sneak preview with a few misgivings. The trailers didn't look all that exciting, and I didn't expect to see anything I hadn't already seen. On one hand, I was right. The animation WAS very good, but nothing that hadn't been done before. But on the other hand I was pleasantly wrong. The formula works perfectly for Bolt. It was fun, didn't have any 'dull' spots, and while my theater was filled with a fairly consistent mix of children and young teens, and a relative smattering of adults, everyone seemed to enjoy it. Laughter was pretty consistent among the old and young, and at the end of the flick I heard something I rarely get to experience in theaters these days: applause. Granted, the adults were the ones applauding, and I joined in enthusiastically. The wife and I agree that this was one movie where we felt we got more than our dollars' worth. Thats a rare treat. Bolt did not disappoint on any level -and will find a spot in our library when the DVD eventually hits market. I fully expect this movie to do very well</review>

W pewnym momencie Ricky dochodzi do wniosku, że trzeba zaryzykować. Sprzedaje samochód, by móc pozwolić sobie na zakup nowej furgonetki, i podejmuje pracę jako niezależny kurier.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Another critical analysis of life in England in 2019. Has English society changed at all since Ken Loach' first films in the 60s? It seems not. Heartbreaking, shameful, relatable and tragically so true. We can all relate to the characters,they are our friends and neighbours and think, there but for the grace of god......The film reminded me of On the Waterfront, with the corrupt 1950s dockside gang masters. How can these working practices have been allowed in England, in the C21st? A decade of capitalist government lade bare, just as the UK decides it's future yet again.Other "reviews" suggest the acting is suspect in places, but I feel this is the film's and LoachKs skill in making the film appear to be so real , so natural, so tragically real.Every scene and every prop had meaning, from the dreadful state of the rented house - why aren't landlords forced to maintain a decent level of decoration and repair. To the fast food of the van dash board- so what is the social and health cost of forcing drivers to work long hours, with no breaks eating sugar filled snacks.

    <desc lang="pl">Ameryka, lata 60. XIX wieku. Pod nieobecność ojca (Bob Odenkirk), który bierze udział w wojnie secesyjnej, opiekę nad czterema siostrami March z Orchard House sprawuje samodzielnie ich matka, Marmee (Laura Dern). Zależy jej na tym, by córki znalazły własną drogę w życiu. Każda z nich ma inną osobowość i inne pragnienia. Najstarsza, Meg (Emma Watson), jest stateczna i marzy o karierze aktorki. Rodzinna i ciepła Beth (Eliza Scanlen) ma talent do gry na pianinie. Jo (Saoirse Ronan), początkująca pisarka, z charakterystyczną dla siebie energią i nieustępliwością realizuje wyznaczone cele. Nieco przemądrzała Amy (Florence Pugh) pragnie zaś zostać malarką. Jednocześnie dziewczęta starają się, jak mogą, by urozmaicić swoje naznaczone brakiem pieniędzy życie, zarażając wszystkich dookoła entuzjazmem i zapałem. Melodramat w reżyserii Grety Gerwing to adaptacja powieści Louisy May Alcott ze świetną obsadą aktorską. Film otrzymał Oscara za najlepsze kostiumy. Został też wyróżniony pięcioma innymi nominacjami do tej prestiżowej nagrody, m.in. w kategorii najlepszy film.</desc>

    <desc lang="xx">Directed by Lasse Hallström.  With Juliette Binoche, Judi Dench, Alfred Molina, Carrie-Anne Moss. A woman and her daughter open a chocolate shop in a small French village that shakes up the rigid morality of the community.</desc>
    <desc lang="pl">Przełom lat 50. i 60. Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche) przeprowadza się z córeczką Anouk (Victoire Thivisol) do prowincjonalnego miasteczka we Francji, gdzie otwiera sklep z czekoladą. Początkowo nie jest lubiana przez mieszkańców. Nie podoba im się to, że ma liberalne poglądy i nie chodzi do kościoła. Nie mogą jej też wybaczyć, że swoją cukiernię otworzyła w okresie Wielkiego Postu. Swoim postępowaniem pani Rocher naraża się zwłaszcza konserwatywnemu merowi, hrabiemu Paulowi de Reynaud (Alfred Molina), który postanawia zrobić wszystko, by jej zaszkodzić. Z czasem jednak pozycja pani Rocher zmienia się. Jako osoba serdeczna zyskuje przychylność otoczenia. Kobieta pomaga Josephine (Lena Olin), która ma brutalnego męża, i stara się sprawić, by Armande (Judi Dench) mogła spotykać się ze swoim wnukiem. Wkrótce w życiu Vianne zjawia się Cygan Roux (Johnny Depp), nowy mieszkaniec miasteczka. Adaptacja książki Joanne Harris balansuje między romantyczną historią a bajką z morałem. W opowieść o kobiecie, która zmienia życie ponurego miasteczka, wpleciony został wątek miłosny. Obraz otrzymał pięć nominacji do Oscara. Na uwagę zasługuje muzyka Rachel Portman, łącząca motywy południowoamerykańskie z francuskimi i irlandzkimi.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Najszybsze na świecie, pewne siebie i nieco bezczelne humanoidalne stworzenie przeżywa kolejne przygody na Ziemi. Sonic, będąc jeszcze dzieckiem, przyciąga niechcianą uwagę na swoje nadprzyrodzone zdolności. Wkrótce staje się ofiarą zamaskowanych napastników. To wydarzenie sprawia, że mały niebieski jeż z pomocą swojej opiekunki oraz z sakiewką magicznych pierścieni udaje się na inną planetę. Poznaje tam nowego przyjaciela, Toma Wachowskiego (James Marsden), z którym łączy siły, aby powstrzymać złego geniusza, dr. Robotnika (Jim Carrey), chcącego schwytać potężnego Sonica i zagarnąć jego niezwykłe moce do zdobycia władzy nad światem. Film jest adaptacją popularnej serii gier wideo Segi i Paramount Pictures. Początkowo design superbohatera miał być zupełnie inny i przypominać ludzko-zwierzęcą hybrydę. Po sprzeciwie wielu fanów, jeszcze przed premierą, zdecydowano się ponownie wprowadzić zmiany w wyglądzie Sonica.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Miłośniczka książek Bella często ucieka w świat fantazji. Mieszka z ojcem, sędziwym wynalazcą Maurycym, we francuskiej wiosce Villeneuve. O względy pięknej marzycielki zabiega arogancki myśliwy Gaston. Dziewczyna odrzuca jego zaloty. Spokój rodziny zostaje zakłócony w dniu, w którym Maurycy wybiera się na targ. W drodze powrotnej chce zerwać różę z ogrodu tajemniczego zamku. Za próbę kradzieży zostaje uwięziony przez zaklętego w bestię księcia. Pomimo strachu jego córka proponuje swoje życie w zamian za wolność rodzica. Potwór przystaje na ofertę. Oddaje młodej kobiecie jedną ze swoich komnat. Bella jest przerażona, ale pewnego dnia odkrywa, że mroczny budynek pełen jest mówiących przedmiotów, które chętnie dotrzymują jej towarzystwa. Wśród nich są zegar Trybik, świecznik Płomyk i miotła Puf Puf. Z czasem uświadamia sobie, że budzący grozę stwór wcale nie jest tak straszny, jak na początku myślała. Mimo odpychającego wyglądu powoli się w nim zakochuje. Nie wie jednak, że mieszkańcy osady szykują się do ataku na zamek...</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Overall the film was decent, a bit boring at times. The acting was OK, but it failed to ever "sweep you away" like the animated version did for years. The most frustrating part was Belle, or Emma. I don't dislike her and I could care less about feminism. However, I do think a lead role that includes substantial signing should be able to.......SING!The horrible use of auto-tune was cringe worthy and her English accent was very thick for someone that was born in Paris and grew up in France.... I though McGregor was great as Lumiere and hid his English accent well. Mrs. Potts and Cogsworth are supposed to be English, so that worked well</review>

This show is very hard to watch at times - and raises the question of "why?" often. Most negative reviews are coming from those who cannot acquire a taste for the vulgarity of this - which is understandable. This show is not for everyone. But it's undeniable that this show is flawlessly directed - and the actors are so impressive. This is not one of the best shows i've seen in terms of story line, but in terms of cinematography and acting this show is superb. Gotta give it up to Zendaya, too. Wow</review>

Numitor musi opuścić więc swoje ziemie. Następcami tronu są dwaj bracia, Enitos oraz Jemos. Niewolnik Wiros bierze udział w rytuale inicjacyjnym w lesie. Półroczny obóz ma na celu zahartować młodych chłopców z plemienia Velii. Na czele grupy staje silny i autorytatywny Gneusz.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I'm honestly baffled. The show is masterfully done. The costumes, colors, cinematography, action sequences - everything is top notch. They even speak archaic latin!!! Acting is stellar, and the story is compelling - I was surprised a couple of times by the story going totally against clichés and being genuinely captivating, which is less and less common nowadays. I have no idea what's going to happen next (apart from the founding of Rome, obviously - but at this moment of a story, it's impossible to tell how exactly it'll unfold, which is great).I love it, and I appreciate an extremely hard work that must have gone into creating the series. Huge congratulations to all involved, the show is simply spectacular!! I'm hooked, I'll be watching and keeping my fingers crossed for season 2.

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Great and Amazing battles/fights among giant monsters, epic and spectacular ones, what everybody was waiting for, if you want to enjoy good monsters and CGI this is you movie, go watch it on the best screen 8.5/10... But the plot is weak, people are stupid and make meaningless decisions.

 --- Review: Great and Amazing battles/fights among giant monsters, epic and spectacular ones, what everybody was waiting for, if you want to enjoy good monsters and CGI this is you movie, go watch it on the best screen 8.5/10... But the plot is weak, people are stupid and make meaningless decisions.

 --- Viewers reactions: Monsters great, people and drama boring ... Writers ruin what could have been a fantastic movie ... Monsters awesome, rest meh ... ARGH JUST KILL THE HUMANS ALREADY ... To much screen time for the humans.</review>

    <desc lang="xx">Directed by Adam Shankman.  With Adam Sandler, Keri Russell, Courteney Cox, Guy Pearce. A hotel handyman's life changes when the lavish bedtime stories he tells his niece and nephew start to magically come true.</desc>
    <desc lang="pl">Skeeter Bronson (Adam Sandler) pracuje w hotelu, który niegdyś należał do jego rodziny. Obiecana mu przez obecnego właściciela, Barry'ego Nottinghama (Richard Griffiths), posada dyrektora przypada ostatecznie jego rywalowi, antypatycznemu Kendallowi Duncanowi (Guy Pearce). Sfrustrowany Skeeter nie może pogodzić się z porażką i rolą życiowego nieudacznika, który nie odniósł zawodowego sukcesu i pozostaje samotny. Odskocznią od codziennych problemów stają się dla niego wieczorne spotkania z siostrzeńcami, którymi opiekuje się pod nieobecność siostry. Wendy (Courteney Cox) niedawno rozwiodła się i w poszukiwaniu lepszej posady musiała wyjechać do innego miasta. Skeeter opowiada swoim małym krewniakom: Patrickowi (Jonathan Morgan Heit) i Bobbi (Laura Ann Kesling) bajki własnego pomysłu. Dzieci chętnie uczestniczą w zabawie, modyfikując narracje wujka i dopowiadając własne zakończenia. Wkrótce Skeeter orientuje się, że to, co wspólnie z siostrzeńcami opowiadają sobie wieczorami, przydarza mu się w życiu. Postanawia wykorzystać ten fakt. Atutami filmu, którego bajkowe epizody rozgrywają się w różnych epokach i stylistykach, są efekty specjalne, charakteryzacja i kostiumy.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Nowy Jork, 1973 rok. Hilly Kristal (Alan Rickman) otwiera klub muzyczny, w którym na żywo występować mają zespoły grające country, bluegrass i bluesa. Od pierwszych liter tych gatunków muzycznych nazywa lokal "CBGB". Okazuje się, że zespoły country nie chcą jednak tu występować. Wówczas Hilly podejmuje decyzję o otwarciu się na zespoły rockowe tworzące własne utwory. W lokalu, który błyskawicznie zyskał popularność, debiutowały takie gwiazdy jak: Blondie, Television, Ramones, Talking Heads, Dead Boys czy The Police. Film opowiadający historię mężczyzny, który przyczynił się do rozwoju rockowej sceny muzycznej, idealnie oddaje atmosferę lat 70. Oprócz oryginalnej ścieżki dźwiękowej w produkcji wykorzystano fragmenty nagrań z autentycznych koncertów w "CBGB". Głównego bohatera zagrał laureat Złotego Globu, Alan Rickman ("Robin Hood: Książę złodziei", "To właśnie miłość").</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Okay first of all if your a big fan of one particular artist or more in the story and are expecting their role (or even their personality) to be fleshed out, chances are you will be disappointed. They are all (aside from the Dead Boys) limited to cameos and as such some people find they are a little generic. I'm not sure how much depth people expect in what often amounts to less than a minutes screen time, but there you go. It is not a long movie and it would have been impossible to do justice to everyone involved in that music scene in such a short time. In the restraints they had, I believe they did well enough.Secondly there are some liberties taken with the actual music. It didn't matter to me as it was all great music, but if your picky on such things that may irritate you. An example of this is that the Ramones don't actually play any Ramones tracks, instead they player a Joey Ramone solo track that was released later. I don't really understand why they made those choices, but that is the way it is. Some people may feel the "live" sound isn't gritty enough. Again, I had no problem here, I wanted to hear good music and I did.Perhaps those that get the most out of this films are those that like the music but aren't huge fans of anyone in specific. This is where I fell and I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. I laughed and I cried and when it finished I was happy. Alan Rickman is the centrepiece of this film and that I think will make this enjoyable to the majority of viewers (as the IMDb average suggests) as he is as solid as ever. The rest of the cast is reasonable but no one stands out. The sets look very accurate (from what I can tell at least) and the whole thing is quite believable.Taken out of the historical context this is basically a light hearted comedy about a growing music scene and a guy with passion, kindness and absolutely no business acumen. It feels like a "British Comedy" which for many will be fine, but given the topic is a New York club some may feel it inappropriate. If you read this review and still want to see the film then you will no doubt enjoy it as much as I have (or more)</review>

    <title lang="pl">W głowie się nie mieści</title>
    <desc lang="xx">Directed by Pete Docter, Ronnie Del Carmen.  With Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Lewis Black, Mindy Kaling. After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school.</desc>
    <desc lang="pl">Jedenastoletnia Riley opuszcza rodzinną Minnesotę. Wraz z rodzicami przeprowadza się do San Francisco. Czuje się zagubiona i próbuje oswoić się z nową sytuacją. Postępowaniem dorastającej dziewczynki kierują emocje. Radość robi wszystko, by utrzymać pozytywny nastrój. Strach, Gniew, Odraza i Smutek starają się jej pomóc, każdy na swój sposób, ale osiągają przeciwny efekt, budząc wątpliwości, lęki, bunt i frustrację. Niespodziewanie Smutek i Radość zostają uwięzione w odległym zakątku umysłu. Muszą jak najszybciej przejąć dowodzenie, gdyż pozostawione na straży Strach, Złość i Wstręt sieją spustoszenie w życiu emocjonalnym nastolatki. Równowaga zostaje zakłócona. Riley jest bezradna i ciągle niezadowolona. Źle się czuje w nowym miejscu. By ją ratować, Smutek i Radość rozpoczynają wędrówkę do centrum sterowania. Najpierw jednak muszą przemierzyć nieznane obszary takie jak Pamięć Długotrwała, Abstrakcyjne Myślenie czy Wytwórnia Snów. Nagrodzona Oscarem podróż do wnętrza umysłu jedenastolatki, która przywodzi na myśl kultowy serial "Było sobie życie". Za reżyserię odpowiada Pete Docter, twórca wielu animowanych hitów, np. "Odlotu", z który również otrzymał Nagrodę Akademii. W polskiej wersji językowej wystąpili: Małgorzata Socha, Kinga Preis, Maja Ostaszewska, Cezary Pazura, Szymon Kuśmider oraz Alicja Kozieja.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I am not normally one to write reviews, but I couldn't help reading several for this film on this site that just did't seem to understand where I think the film was supposed to be coming from.The majority of the complaints I saw were that the film was 'too depressing for a children's film', but whilst I see where they are coming from in some regards, every child who I have seen watch this film (I work in a cinema) has absolutely loved it, and laughed out loud almost constantly. They are not old enough to realise the message the film is trying to convey: that life isn't all about happiness. I applaud the attempt from Pixar to make a film that is not only hilarious in places, but is also a major comment on what life is like to be a younger teenager, transitioning through one of the most important moments of life. From a more personal perspective, why should everything we show our children gloss over the reality of life, and try to make them believe everything is rosy 24/7? Again, what this film does brilliantly through the message I took away at the end was that life will never be 100% full of happiness, but that is fine. Why does it have to be? A little bit of sadness is necessary. If a person was never sad, they would be inhumane. Overall then, I suppose my review is more of a comment on the type of film we exhibit to children, and how the Nanny-state we live in looks to protect them from most of lives inevitabilities. Either way, what can't be ignored is that this film is equal parts sad, and equal parts what I am sure will become a timeless classic in years to come</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: There are quite a few nice things about this film. In particular, Zathura is an aesthetically intelligent film. The makers did a great job of not relying too heavily on CGI; very thoughtful design and effects. The convincing use of miniatures, real sets and chaos/destruction really brought the story to life. True, its a kids movie. But not so much that it annoys, there's a timeless and attractive notion of adventure. Really hearkens back to the glory of 80's kids adventure movies. The film's gadgets and knick-knacks were great. The house and Zathura game-board were both characters in and of themselves, every bit as important as the actors (who did a fine job). Throughout I felt like I was watching a little of "Time Bandits" mixed with some "Goonies" and maybe some "Hitchikers Guide..." or "House".Some folks seem ambivalent to the film. That's unfortunate. Up against a lot of the uninspired sh*t that is released these days, Zathura is very successful in creating a fun and visually convincing escape. Half way through the movie I realized that I was waiting/anticipating the film's failure, that it was going to let me down. Never did. I appreciated the film</review>

    <desc lang="pl">Stany Zjednoczone, lata 70. Pewny siebie, elokwentny Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) jest wielkim gwiazdorem stacji telewizyjnej w San Diego, w której prowadzi wiadomości na kanale 4. Telewidzowie go uwielbiają, a on świetnie zdaje sobie z tego sprawę. Pewnego dnia w jego stacji zostaje zatrudniona atrakcyjna młoda dziennikarka Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate). Kobieta szybko wpada w oko Ronowi. Mimo że jest ambitna, spiker nie traktuje jej jak rywalki, ponieważ Veronica zajmuje się typowo kobiecą tematyką: modą i gotowaniem. Niespodziewanie jednak dziennikarka zastępuje Rona, gdy ten nie może prowadzić wiadomości. Od tego dnia wybucha między nimi wojna.</desc>

In fact, I would not have even LOOKED at it had my remote control not stuck on the stupid channel. So I watched a few minutes. I didn't laugh. I wasn't surprised.Then one day, surfing the premium movie channels, I was thoroughly unimpressed by the offerings. So I turned on Anchorman, about 5 minutes in. For the next hour and a half, I proceeded to laugh hysterically. Scene after scene, line after line, I found new reasons to laugh. By the end, I could hardly breathe.Unconvinced that I had stumbled upon a a re-watchable movie, I tested and retested it over and over. And over. Result confirmed.Anchorman tells a simple story: acclaimed (and consequently arrogant) news anchor Ron Burgundy is forced to adapt when an attractive new female member of the Channel 4 news team (Applegate) begins changing the way he and his quirky news team work. That's it. This story is predictable, prescription-esquire, boring. But Anchorman does not draw it's strength from story. It draws from the hilarious situations. It draws from randomness. It draws from brief--but memorable--cameos. It draws from those 100 or so unforgettable one-liners.That is, if you're looking for cinema, for a fine work of craftsmanship, a eloquent script, and an Oscar nomination, go watch a FILM.

    <desc lang="pl">Dawni rywale, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) i Weronika Corningstone (Christina Applegate), są już małżeństwem. Oboje pracują dla prestiżowej sieci prasowej w Nowym Jorku. Pewnego dnia, Mack Tannen (Harrison Ford), najpopularniejszy prezenter wieczornych wiadomości, przechodzi na emeryturę. Na swoje miejsce promuje Veronicę. Zazdrosny o sukcesy żony Ron odchodzi od niej i ich 6-letniego syna, Waltera (Judy Nelson). Pół roku później Burgundy wraca do San Diego, gdzie zmaga się z depresją. Znajduje pracę w delfinarium, ale za obrażanie publiczności i niezdrowy stosunek do zwierząt zostaje zwolniony. Zrozpaczony postanawia się zabić i ostatecznie wiesza się na lampie. Po nieudanej próbie samobójczej znajduje go wysłannik nowej stacji TV. Okazuje się, że w Nowym Jorku miliarder Freddie Shapp (Dylan Baker Shapp) postanowił otworzyć pierwszą na świecie telewizję, nadającą wiadomości przez całą dobę. Ron przyjmuje pracę i zbiera swoją starą ekipę, by poprowadzić 24-godzinny kanał informacyjny. Werbuje dawnych kolegów po fachu: Champa Kinda (David Koechner), który został właścicielem sklepu ze smażonymi kurczakami, Briana Fantanę (Paul Rudd), teraz słynnego fotografa kotów, oraz Bricka Tamlanda (Steve Carell), który został uznany za zmarłego. Reporterzy mają prowadzić nocne pasmo, podczas gdy spiker Jack Limo (James Marsden) prezentuje wiadomości w primetime. W międzyczasie Ron odkrywa, że Veronica zaczęła spotykać się z innym mężczyzną, psychologiem o imieniu Gary (Greg Kinnear). Kontynuacja filmu z 2004 roku, której reżyserem ponownie jest Adam McKay ("Policja zastępcza"). Scenariusz do drugiej części produkcji także napisał do spółki z odtwórcą głównej roli, Willem Ferrellem. W epizodycznych rolach pojawia się plejada gwiazd, m.in.: Kirsten Dunst, Sasha Baron Cohen, Liam Neeson, John C. Reilly, Kanye West czy Jim Carrey.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I still remember the feeling; that aura of anticipation that i felt when the announcement was made. Anchorman 2 was in production. Finally, big Ron was on his way back!!! The magical news team where going to be gracing the big screen and i couldn't have been any more excited. The first film was very close to comedic perfection; it had everything that was needed and much like any film that you thoroughly enjoy you want to see more, but in the back of your mind you don't want the film to become tainted. And although this film has its droves of fans, for me it was incredibly disappointing. They took it too far. The stupidity in the first film was perfectly balanced. It was funny. This however was over the top. There are certain scenes that are very uncomfortable to watch as they try so hard to make you laugh. And as the ridiculousness accelerated, my gut began to churn and any smile that wanted to force it's way out to stay loyal to the first film was obliterated and all that was left was me,- insert summary here -. Disappointment is too feeble of an explanation to how gutted i was at the way this film played out. So much of the first film was regurgitated. First couple of carbon copy moments i tried to ignore and enjoy but it eventually became so obvious and so desperate. The continual "by the beard of...", like quotations from Ron was tedious. And the shark....well i'll let you see that farcical moment for yourselves.I tried, i really tried to enjoy this film, and yes, it had it's fair share of moments that made me laugh, but it is nothing more than a moneymaker. And it will do its job. But that doesn't stop it from being a massive let down. Sequels tend to work when they are planned, not when they are demanded</review>

 --- Review: I still remember the feeling; that aura of anticipation that i felt when the announcement was made. Anchorman 2 was in production. Finally, big Ron was on his way back!!! The magical news team where going to be gracing the big screen and i couldn't have been any more excited. The first film was very close to comedic perfection; it had everything that was needed and much like any film that you thoroughly enjoy you want to see more, but in the back of your mind you don't want the film to become tainted. And although this film has its droves of fans, for me it was incredibly disappointing. They took it too far. The stupidity in the first film was perfectly balanced. It was funny. This however was over the top. There are certain scenes that are very uncomfortable to watch as they try so hard to make you laugh. And as the ridiculousness accelerated, my gut began to churn and any smile that wanted to force it's way out to stay loyal to the first film was obliterated and all that was left was me,- insert summary here -. Disappointment is too feeble of an explanation to how gutted i was at the way this film played out. So much of the first film was regurgitated. First couple of carbon copy moments i tried to ignore and enjoy but it eventually became so obvious and so desperate. The continual "by the beard of...", like quotations from Ron was tedious. And the shark....well i'll let you see that farcical moment for yourselves.I tried, i really tried to enjoy this film, and yes, it had it's fair share of moments that made me laugh, but it is nothing more than a moneymaker. And it will do its job. But that doesn't stop it from being a massive let down. Sequels tend to work when they are planned, not when they are demanded
 --- Viewers reactions: Feel like I have just received a massive kick to the genitals. ... Disregard other reviews. Watch this movie. You will laugh out loud non stop ... An abomination ... Just awful... ... Snobs</review>

I do agree with others when they say this show was a victim of its time. There was so many other shows on at the time it just got lost. I liked all the characters. I enjoyed most of the story lines. I would say 90% of the episodes are great. You always have some fillers in any tv show. One thing i did hate was not the original theme song but when they changed it. It was terrible and was really distracting. Many didnt like the original theme song but i thought it gave the show its own personality. Anyway i enjoyed. The show should of been at least 6 seasons.

 --- Review: I just finished binge watching all 4 seasons and i am happy to say i thoroughly enjoyed myself.I do remember seeing a few episodes when i was younger but i didnt pay much attention. I do agree with others when they say this show was a victim of its time. There was so many other shows on at the time it just got lost. I liked all the characters. I enjoyed most of the story lines. I would say 90% of the episodes are great. You always have some fillers in any tv show. One thing i did hate was not the original theme song but when they changed it. It was terrible and was really distracting. Many didnt like the original theme song but i thought it gave the show its own personality. Anyway i enjoyed. The show should of been at least 6 seasons. I just hope the actors know what a wonderful show they made and not remember all the idiot critics comments that plagued this show. I dont know why people listen to critics
 --- Viewers reactions: Very underated ... Cancelled too soon ... An excellent Star Trek series that was a victim of bad timing ... Star Trek: In The Beginning... ... Now, they get better when it's too late!</review>

 --- Review: Very few TV shows based on films are ever good, this one is. Very few TV shows can maintain their pace and originality over the years, this one has. I've just watched the first 6 episodes of season 4 and each and every one of them has been a cracker.This show has lots going for it; intelligent and convincing plots, great multi-dimensional characters, superb actors (both major and minor players), expert direction (hats off to Peter DeLuise), continuity of story, consistent use/appearance of sci-fi technology, witty but subtle dialog and almost as an aside, stunning FX.The only thing left to say is that I feel sorry for people that haven't been watching up till now. Please, it's not too late

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 1199099, Title: Merlin, Starrating: 4.7/5 
 --- Description: Created by Johnny Capps, Julian Jones, Jake Michie.  With John Hurt, Colin Morgan, Bradley James, Richard Wilson. These are the brand new adventures of Merlin, the legendary sorcerer as a young man, when he was just a servant to young Prince Arthur on the royal court of Camelot, who has soon become his best friend, and turned Arthur into a great king and a legend. 
 --- Director: Jeremy Webb, Alice Troughton, David Moore, Justin Molotnikov, Ashley Way
 --- Actors: John Hurt (role=The Dragon), Colin Morgan (role=Merlin), Bradley James (role=Arthur), Richard Wilson (role=Gaius), Angel Coulby (role=Gwen), Katie McGrath (role=Morgana), Anthony Head (role=Uther Pendragon), Rupert Young (role=Sir Leon), Eoin Macken (role=Sir Gwaine), Tom Hopper (role=Sir Percival), Tomiwa Edun (role=Sir Elyan), Nathaniel Parker (role=Agravaine)
 --- Review: Oh Merlin. Four years since I finished my last re-watch and you're still breaking my heart. You are quite terrible in many ways, with some of the cheesiest special effects I've ever seen on television, and some of the cheesiest writing as well, but your story captured my imagination like no Game of Thrones has done.

    <desc lang="xx">Directed by Zack Snyder.  With Sarah Polley, Ving Rhames, Mekhi Phifer, Jake Weber. A nurse, a policeman, a young married couple, a salesman and other survivors of a worldwide plague that is producing aggressive, flesh-eating zombies, take refuge in a mega Midwestern shopping mall.</desc>
    <desc lang="pl">Wisconsin. W domku na przedmieściach dochodzi do tragedii. Córeczka pielęgniarki Any (Sarah Polley) niespodziewanie rzuca się na swojego ojca i gryzie go w szyję. Gdy odzyskuje on przytomność, okazuje się, że sam również zamienił się w bestię, zagrażającą Anie. Kobieta ucieka. Po drodze zauważa, że w okolicy grasują krwiożercze zombi. Chroni się w centrum handlowym, gdzie ukryli się również inni mieszkańcy, m.in. policjant Kenneth (Ving Rhames), sprzedawca Michael (Jake Weber) oraz Andre (Mekhi Phifer) i jego ciężarna żona. Trafiają tam kolejni uciekinierzy. Kenneth zostaje ich nieformalnym przywódcą. Wkrótce kończą im się zapasy żywności, a zombi nie ustają w atakach. Ukrywający się szybko się orientują, że ten, kto zostanie pogryziony przez potwora, również staje się bestią. Zdesperowani Ana i Kenneth wraz z kilkoma innymi osobami postanawiają dotrzeć łódką na wyspę, gdzie byliby bezpieczni.</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: Dawn of the DeadI'm not sure I can recall witnessing an opening sequence quite like the one I saw in Zack Snyder's remake of the classic horror film 'Dawn of the Dead.' Besides being rather lengthy (it's over ten minutes before we see the opening credits), it has a bizarre creepiness about it. There's something about the cinematography employed to show us 'the beginning of the end' that I really liked: that extra long image of the little girl skating away, the skyview of Sarah Polly's car as she rides home from her shift as a nurse, the picture of perfect serenity, and those intimate scenes we see of her and her husband 'the day before.' It all makes it more tragic, when, quite unexpectedly, morning comes, and with it, the end of all that is sane. The pure chaos of the scenario, an outbreak of a dangerous break of a virus that turns those infected into ghouls, comes so suddenly that it grips us by the throat.This is one hell of a horror movie. Even for someone as jaded as myself, who has become totally jaded to any real horror thrills, I was taken aback by how uncomfortable the movie made me feel. Our heroes, holed up at the now abandoned local mall, join small groups of survivors and find themselves fighting each other as well as the zombies when the plague starts creeping ever close to bringing them all to the brink of annihilation. The zombies have an easy-to-spot weakness: one shot to the head takes them out, but they're extremely fast, and a single bite from them leads to hopeless infection and mindlessness. Although some of the story makes little sense (for instance, if the zombies can only transmit the virus by bite and the heroes are in a mall, couldn't they don the heaviest attire imaginable rather than skimpy t-shirts?), there are lots of great twists and snappy dialogue along with the required creep-outs, gore, and slaughter.And there's some surprisingly great humor. Easily the most memorable of the light-hearted, break-the-nerves moments is when our heroes are situated atop a roof and challenge a local gun shop owner to take out look-alike zombie celebrities, which he does with ease. It's a much needed laugh to relieve the audience of a lot of built-up jitters.Overall, this is a remake that actually works. The characters, for all their strength and weaknesses, are decently fleshed out for a horror movie. There a few unexpected surprises that even the most attentive viewer will take pleasure in. And the action moves along at a clean, fast pace. The few holes that exist in the plot and the somewhat unsatisfying conclusion are the only real problem areas, but these are to be expected in the genre. Overall, I definitely recommend it, even to the squeamish. It's messy fun for everyone. And make sure you stay until AFTER the credits roll. You'll be glad you did.Grade: A</review>

 --- Viewers reactions: A Zombie Flick to Remember!!! ... Why I gave Dawn a 10 (well, maybe it should have been a9). ... At last, someone's got it right... ... As good as the original, with exciting new directions and room for a sequel! ... In a world of bad remakes, this wasn't bad.</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I just finished binge watching all 4 seasons and i am happy to say i thoroughly enjoyed myself.I do remember seeing a few episodes when i was younger but i didnt pay much attention. I do agree with others when they say this show was a victim of its time. There was so many other shows on at the time it just got lost. I liked all the characters. I enjoyed most of the story lines. I would say 90% of the episodes are great. You always have some fillers in any tv show. One thing i did hate was not the original theme song but when they changed it. It was terrible and was really distracting. Many didnt like the original theme song but i thought it gave the show its own personality. Anyway i enjoyed. The show should of been at least 6 seasons. I just hope the actors know what a wonderful show they made and not remember all the idiot critics comments that plagued this show. I dont know why people listen to critics</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: You mean this show was produced by Sam Raimi? The same horror loving, cheese flaunting, camera angle loving, wire fu abusing, low budget utilizing, Bruce Campbell toting, Ted Raimi killing, Spiderman trilogy directing machine? Yes.I have to admit, when I first saw this show I thought it was one of the worst shows I had ever seen. It was always on right before the show I would want to see and I would catch glimpses of the cheesy graphics, strange camera angles, insane dialogue, etc. and would laugh at how bad it was. However, the moment I discovered that Sam Raimi produced the show, it was an instant "OOOOH, so the show is SUPPOSED to be that way!" and I gave it a chance. The more I watched the show, the more I realized how amazing the show was. While the cheesy graphics were a result of the times and budget (keep in mind, though, that the same company who did the graphics in the show would go on to produce the award winning graphics for Lord of the Rings), Sam Raimi uses his trademark skills to make this show thoroughly entertaining.The intentionally over-acted, pun-ridden dialogue, extensively choreographed action scenes, fun costumes, and crazy myth-based story lines make this show a delight, but I think it's the visible enjoyment of the main cast that makes this show really great. Everybody, from the reoccurring characters to the show's main stars are obviously having the time of their lives enjoying every single line and action sequence. It helps that the producers allowed the actors to adlib a lot of the dialogue and physical gags.As for the show's cast, I couldn't imagine anyone better to play Hercules than 90's Television's straight lead man, Kevin Sorbo. Sure, he oftentimes just stands there with clothes that conveniently reveal his always sweaty muscular chest, but he fit the role to a T. He did a great job playing the almost sickeningly perfect half-mortal Hercules (something they joke about continuously in the series) and obviously enjoyed himself in the fight scenes. Other notable mentions include Bruce Campbell (of course) whose smarmy portrayal of the King of Thieves is priceless (he even directed a number of the best episodes of the show), Kevin Smith (no, not THAT Kevin Smith) who was priceless as Ares, God of War, reveling in over-the-top testosterone and much improvised humor, and Alexandra Tydings as Aphrodite, God of Love, who played the part of a ditsy blonde perfectly.However, probably THE most talented actor in the Hercules/Xena troupe was Michael Hurst, who portrayed Hercules short and peppy sidekick, Iolaus. In order to be noticed or successful as an actor here IN New Zealand, theater is still the primary form of entertainment. Well before Hercules, Hurst was already a renown New Zealand Shakespearean theater actor, director, producer, dancer, and singer, in addition to a championship fencer and acrobatic stage-fight choreographer. If I could choose anyone to compare this guy to, it'd be Britain's thespian Kenneth Branagh...if he could do gymnastics and was on speed. His energetic talent was so well known in the country that he was literally the first person to be cast in Hercules (BEFORE even Kevin Sorbo got the part as the lead). He stole the show with this energetic and over-the-top acting style for Iolaus and choreographed/performed most of the Hercules/Iolaus fight scenes and stunts. While he never really got a chance to exhibit his true acting prowress due to the light nature of the show, he came close with versatility. Presumably bored with his role, Raimi and the producers found every excuse in the book to allow Hurst to exercise his acting - by the time Hercules ended, he had played about 12 different characters in addition to Iolaus ranging anywhere from a drunken writer to a reoccurring woman dance instructor. There's no question that this show wouldn't have been as successful if Michael Hurst hadn't contributed his talent. I've always been kind of upset that Hurst will never be recognized outside our country (beyond "that short hyper blonde guy from Hercules") due to his extensive involvement with New Zealand theater - this guy could have easily gone on to do Broadway in the States or the Royal Shakespeare Company in Britain. However, I'm pleased to hear he still works on Sam Raimi projects when not doing plays, directing episodes for Legend of the Seeker and, more recently, Spartacus - both of which we get down here, yay! So, in sum, Sam Raimi is insane but incredibly brilliant for producing this show. I highly recommend it for those of you that "get" Raimi's unique direction or if you have any sense of humor whatsoever. It's extremely addictive. Do NOT take it seriously, or you will be disappointed - it's supposed to be campy. If you are a fan of anything Sam Raimi, entertaining fight sequences, Kevin Sorbo or Michael Hurst (if you happen to be from New Zealand), or enjoy watching actors have WAY too much fun for their own good, then this is a show for you</review>

However, the moment I discovered that Sam Raimi produced the show, it was an instant "OOOOH, so the show is SUPPOSED to be that way!" and I gave it a chance. The more I watched the show, the more I realized how amazing the show was. While the cheesy graphics were a result of the times and budget (keep in mind, though, that the same company who did the graphics in the show would go on to produce the award winning graphics for Lord of the Rings), Sam Raimi uses his trademark skills to make this show thoroughly entertaining.The intentionally over-acted, pun-ridden dialogue, extensively choreographed action scenes, fun costumes, and crazy myth-based story lines make this show a delight, but I think it's the visible enjoyment of the main cast that makes this show really great. Everybody, from the reoccurring characters to the show's main stars are obviously having the time of their lives enjoying every single line and action sequence. It helps that the producers allowed the actors to adlib a lot of the dialogue and physical gags.As for the show's cast, I couldn't imagine anyone better to play Hercules than 90's Television's straight lead man, Kevin Sorbo. Sure, he oftentimes just stands there with clothes that conveniently reveal his always sweaty muscular chest, but he fit the role to a T. He did a great job playing the almost sickeningly perfect half-mortal Hercules (something they joke about continuously in the series) and obviously enjoyed himself in the fight scenes. Other notable mentions include Bruce Campbell (of course) whose smarmy portrayal of the King of Thieves is priceless (he even directed a number of the best episodes of the show), Kevin Smith (no, not THAT Kevin Smith) who was priceless as Ares, God of War, reveling in over-the-top testosterone and much improvised humor, and Alexandra Tydings as Aphrodite, God of Love, who played the part of a ditsy blonde perfectly.However, probably THE most talented actor in the Hercules/Xena troupe was Michael Hurst, who portrayed Hercules short and peppy sidekick, Iolaus. In order to be noticed or successful as an actor here IN New Zealand, theater is still the primary form of entertainment. Well before Hercules, Hurst was already a renown New Zealand Shakespearean theater actor, director, producer, dancer, and singer, in addition to a championship fencer and acrobatic stage-fight choreographer. If I could choose anyone to compare this guy to, it'd be Britain's thespian Kenneth Branagh...if he could do gymnastics and was on speed. His energetic talent was so well known in the country that he was literally the first person to be cast in Hercules (BEFORE even Kevin Sorbo got the part as the lead). He stole the show with this energetic and over-the-top acting style for Iolaus and choreographed/performed most of the Hercules/Iolaus fight scenes and stunts. While he never really got a chance to exhibit his true acting prowress due to the light nature of the show, he came close with versatility. Presumably bored with his role, Raimi and the producers found every excuse in the book to allow Hurst to exercise his acting - by the time Hercules ended, he had played about 12 different characters in addition to Iolaus ranging anywhere from a drunken writer to a reoccurring woman dance instructor. There's no question that this show wouldn't have been as successful if Michael Hurst hadn't contributed his talent. I've always been kind of upset that Hurst will never be recognized outside our country (beyond "that short hyper blonde guy from Hercules") due to his extensive involvement with New Zealand theater - this guy could have easily gone on to do Broadway in the States or the Royal Shakespeare Company in Britain. However, I'm pleased to hear he still works on Sam Raimi projects when not doing plays, directing episodes for Legend of the Seeker and, more recently, Spartacus - both of which we get down here, yay! So, in sum, Sam Raimi is insane but incredibly brilliant for producing this show. I highly recommend it for those of you that "get" Raimi's unique direction or if you have any sense of humor whatsoever. It's extremely addictive. Do NOT take it seriously, or you will be disappointed - it's supposed to be campy. If you are a fan of anything Sam Raimi, entertaining fight sequences, Kevin Sorbo or Michael Hurst (if you happen to be from New Zealand), or enjoy watching actors have WAY too much fun for their own good, then this is a show for you

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I just finished binge watching all 4 seasons and i am happy to say i thoroughly enjoyed myself.I do remember seeing a few episodes when i was younger but i didnt pay much attention. I do agree with others when they say this show was a victim of its time. There was so many other shows on at the time it just got lost. I liked all the characters. I enjoyed most of the story lines. I would say 90% of the episodes are great. You always have some fillers in any tv show. One thing i did hate was not the original theme song but when they changed it. It was terrible and was really distracting. Many didnt like the original theme song but i thought it gave the show its own personality. Anyway i enjoyed. The show should of been at least 6 seasons. I just hope the actors know what a wonderful show they made and not remember all the idiot critics comments that plagued this show. I dont know why people listen to critics</review>

 --- Viewers reactions: Very underated ... Cancelled too soon ... An excellent Star Trek series that was a victim of bad timing ... Star Trek: In The Beginning... ... Now, they get better when it's too late!</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: I just finished binge watching all 4 seasons and i am happy to say i thoroughly enjoyed myself.I do remember seeing a few episodes when i was younger but i didnt pay much attention. I do agree with others when they say this show was a victim of its time. There was so many other shows on at the time it just got lost. I liked all the characters. I enjoyed most of the story lines. I would say 90% of the episodes are great. You always have some fillers in any tv show. One thing i did hate was not the original theme song but when they changed it. It was terrible and was really distracting. Many didnt like the original theme song but i thought it gave the show its own personality. Anyway i enjoyed. The show should of been at least 6 seasons.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 1199099, Title: Merlin, Starrating: 4.7/5 
 --- Description: Created by Johnny Capps, Julian Jones, Jake Michie.  With John Hurt, Colin Morgan, Bradley James, Richard Wilson. These are the brand new adventures of Merlin, the legendary sorcerer as a young man, when he was just a servant to young Prince Arthur on the royal court of Camelot, who has soon become his best friend, and turned Arthur into a great king and a legend. 
 --- Director: Jeremy Webb, Alice Troughton, David Moore, Justin Molotnikov, Ashley Way
 --- Actors: John Hurt (role=The Dragon), Colin Morgan (role=Merlin), Bradley James (role=Arthur), Richard Wilson (role=Gaius), Angel Coulby (role=Gwen), Katie McGrath (role=Morgana), Anthony Head (role=Uther Pendragon), Rupert Young (role=Sir Leon), Eoin Macken (role=Sir Gwaine), Tom Hopper (role=Sir Percival), Tomiwa Edun (role=Sir Elyan), Nathaniel Parker (role=Agravaine)
 --- Review: Oh Merlin. Four years since I finished my last re-watch and you're still breaking my heart. You are quite terrible in many ways, with some of the cheesiest special effects I've ever seen on television, and some of the cheesiest writing as well, but your story captured my imagination like no Game of Thrones has done. The friendship/romance between Merlin and Arthur is almost unbearably lovely and the characters of Guinevere and the knights still haven't left my heart. There were moments of absolute brilliance in this little family show elevated by beautiful acting that still resonate and stay with me after all these years. I would go through it all again
 --- Viewers reactions: BBC Merlin, I just can't get over you. ... I'm still not over it ... For what it is, actually fairly good ... Season6 ... Fantastic Family Viewing</review>

 --- Description: Created by Jonathan Glassner, Brad Wright.  With Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge. A secret military team, SG-1, is formed to explore other planets through the recently discovered Stargates. 
 --- Director: Peter DeLuise, Martin Wood, Andy Mikita, William Waring, William Gereghty

Colonel Cameron Mitchell), Beau Bridges (role=Major General Hank Landry), Claudia Black (role=Vala Mal Doran), Corin Nemec (role=Jonas Quinn)
 --- Review: Very few TV shows based on films are ever good, this one is. Very few TV shows can maintain their pace and originality over the years, this one has. I've just watched the first 6 episodes of season 4 and each and every one of them has been a cracker.This show has lots going for it; intelligent and convincing plots, great multi-dimensional characters, superb actors (both major and minor players), expert direction (hats off to Peter DeLuise), continuity of story, consistent use/appearance of sci-fi technology, witty but subtle dialog and almost as an aside, stunning FX.The only thing left to say is that I feel sorry for people that haven't been watching up till now. Please, it's not too late
 --- Viewers reactions: This show continues to impress me. ... I miss stargate ... It just keeps going ... The franchise to fear ... Well Done!</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: First up this is clearly a show with a tiny budget, and so it has some rough edges. But damn it's fun. Funny, energetic, and irreverent yet somehow is already injecting some solid heart and feels in there.The show looks stunning, the three core characters have great chemistry, the villain is the best kind of over the top unstable. Fun soundtrack keeps the pace up. So many nods to other sci-fi seemingly poking fun at the cliches it's using.I couldn't believe how quickly the episode went, and how much happened. In an age of film length stories dragging themselves out over the hours and hours of a tv series, this was a breath of fresh air. So sad not to be able to binge the lot.Some of the VFX are a bit shoddy, the CG feels especially dated, and while I appreciated the bright colours and style they were going for, I wish they had opted for an even more lofi approach and used old school physical models instead.But I've already watched the pilot twice, and am eager for more, I hope they keep it up, and if they do, it'll be the easy tv pleasure I so often crave</review>

 --- Review: First up this is clearly a show with a tiny budget, and so it has some rough edges. But damn it's fun. Funny, energetic, and irreverent yet somehow is already injecting some solid heart and feels in there.The show looks stunning, the three core characters have great chemistry, the villain is the best kind of over the top unstable. Fun soundtrack keeps the pace up. So many nods to other sci-fi seemingly poking fun at the cliches it's using.I couldn't believe how quickly the episode went, and how much happened. In an age of film length stories dragging themselves out over the hours and hours of a tv series, this was a breath of fresh air. So sad not to be able to binge the lot.Some of the VFX are a bit shoddy, the CG feels especially dated, and while I appreciated the bright colours and style they were going for, I wish they had opted for an even more lofi approach and used old school physical models instead.But I've already watched the pilot twice, and am eager for more, I hope they keep it up, and if they do, it'll be the easy tv pleasure I so often crave
 --- Viewers reactions: Pure Fun ... A series only a sci-fi fanatic could ...... tolerate. ... Diamond in the Rough ... Accomplishes Its Goal ... Cheesy &amp; entertaining</review>

It seemed that they took a really bad, wannabe Kung-Fu movie added some Street Fighter names and thought that would good enough to pass it off as a Street Fighter movie. Horrible, almost nonexistent plot, bad acting, and terrible fight scenes make this movie not worth the time it takes to watch it. At times it was funny though, but not intentionally. When certain characters try to be serious or they throw out some line they think would be good catch phrase you can't help but laugh at how poor the acting was</review>

    <review type="text">IMDb review: For the first time in years, we walked out of the cinema. It's not a movie - it's a political attack of a worst kind. There's no plot, no story - just re-telling of news reports from the last few years in Poland. One star for some smashing performances of lead Polish actors and actresses but the whole thing is not worth the time. (As a disclosure - I don't support Polish PiS government, so I really wanted to like the movie.)</review>

David Gilmour, Nick Mason and Richard Wright, supported by outstanding musicians and backing vocals, and a great selection of songs, give a marvelous 90 min. concert. Although without Roger Waters - the creative soul of the group, this show is stunning. It is difficult to highlight a song, but `The Great Gig in the Sky' in the voices of Margret Taylot, Durga McBroom and Rachel Fury and the saxophone of Scott Page in `Us and Them' are unforgettable.
