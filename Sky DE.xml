The individual episodes are fine. They tell a story, Bull always wins for whichever side hires him, and the following week they start all over again. That's the problem. That and the utter lack of character development. I need the latter to enjoy any show I watch. However, if the former is all you need to enjoy a show, then by all means, enjoy this one. Each episode is a one off and taken individually, they're pretty much 7 star good. It's just not my thing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15629,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Great actors with interesting storylines, it had the perfect amount of humor and heart to go along with the brutal cases brought into the hospital. But then it started to lose it's heart, characters became extremely annoying, and the personal issues of the characters became exhausting as they never seemed to change. Grey's Anatomy had a great cast to start with, then they took those characters and slowly made them unbearable to stand. While eventually getting rid of some of the best actors on the show to replace them with people who you will not be able to tolerate for very long. I wish this show would focus more on the medicine aspect and less on the personal lives of the doctors. It would be nice if they would clean up the cast and get better actors with better storylines or just end the show! 15 seasons is a bit much.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":260240,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Despite all his craziness, he is totally likeable and his relationship with the Julia Roberts character is wonderfully complex and believable.  Julia Roberts also gives an excellent performance and the chemistry between the two leads is perfect.\n\nAll in all, I loved this film and didn't understand why it was so underrated by the critics.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His part calls for an uneasy balance between a paranoid psychotic and romantic leading man and he treds that fine line beautifully.  Despite all his craziness, he is totally likeable and his relationship with the Julia Roberts character is wonderfully complex and believable.  Julia Roberts also gives an excellent performance and the chemistry between the two leads is perfect.\n\nAll in all, I loved this film and didn't understand why it was so underrated by the critics.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT2H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Auf einer Party, die von dem berüchtigten Pablo Escobar veranstaltet wird, lernt sie den Drogenbaron kennen und erliegt sofort seiner Ausstrahlung.

I just don't think the plot was strong enough and I don't get the same charming and funny vibe I usually get when watching a movie with any of these actors in it. I feel that a lot of the movie was also was very cliché and predictable. I do think that this movie could have been a lot better. It was entertaining enough, but I can truthfully say I won't be buying this one on DVD.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":232168,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Moses (Christian Bale) saves Ramesses' (Joel Edgerton) life in a battle with the Hittite. Prophecy suggests that Moses would become the leader. Moses' true origin is revealed and Ramesses becomes leader after his father's death. Moses had discovered Viceroy Hegep's corruption. Hegep reveals Moses' secret to Ramesses and Moses is sent into exile. After having a family, God sends him back to Egypt to lead his people out of slavery.\n\nThere are some minor differences from 'The Ten Commandments (56)' that explains the human interactions. Ridley Scott brings the big action. There are great actors doing good work. In the end, this is simply another version of the epic with some changes. It is technically sound.

Moses (Christian Bale) saves Ramesses' (Joel Edgerton) life in a battle with the Hittite. Prophecy suggests that Moses would become the leader. Moses' true origin is revealed and Ramesses becomes leader after his father's death. Moses had discovered Viceroy Hegep's corruption. Hegep reveals Moses' secret to Ramesses and Moses is sent into exile. After having a family, God sends him back to Egypt to lead his people out of slavery.\n\nThere are some minor differences from 'The Ten Commandments (56)' that explains the human interactions. Ridley Scott brings the big action. There are great actors doing good work. In the end, this is simply another version of the epic with some changes. It is technically sound. The pace is uneven with some very slow sections. It doesn't add anything to the story or cinema. It can only redo some of the iconic special effects. It doesn't dive into Moses' personality. It tries to make him more human and less icon. It's not as compelling. It leaves me wondering why this movie needed to be made.

While some of the reviews are over the top, this is certainly one of those popcorn movies that I wouldn't mind spending a little dough on.

I want to be entertained. that is it.

So its all out war for unlucky Police Detective named McClane, in a heart-stopping, jet-propelled journey through excitement and terror.\n\nOn a snowy Christmas Eve in the nation's capital, a team of terrorist have seized a major international airport, and now holds thousands of holiday travellers hostage. The terrorists, a renegade band of crack military commandos led by murderous rogue officer, have come to rescue a drug lord from justice. They've prepared for every contingency, except one: John McClane, an off-duty cop seized by a feeling of deadly deja vu. The heroic cop not only has to battle terrorists, but also an incompetent airport police chief, the hard headed commander of the army's anti-terrorist squad and a deadly winter snowstorm. The runways are littered with death and destruction, and McClane is in a race against time. His wife is trapped on one of the planes circling somewhere overhead, desperately low on fuel!\n\nDie Hard 2 makes Bruce Willis look better and better. The role of John McClane is one filled with the fight for right and to trying to stop the bad guys. Again a lot of the stunts would have been done by Willis considering the professionalism of the man. Running all over an airport in a fierce snowstorm, fighting scenes on the wing of a real 747 jet and trying to save lives he has no attachment to, L.A. cop John McClane puts his body on the line, so justice is served and so did the actor Bruce Willis in my view to bring a great action movie back for a second time. Willis is one of my favourite actors, but I have only started to watch his movies in about the last 2-3 years and what a mistake that has been.   \n\nThis film has more freedom as it is held at an airport. McClane is like I have said all over the place. The freedom and space this story has makes this film much easier to watch. Another thing which is impressive about Die Hard 2 is the effort to put more thrills in the movie. The snow (which of course is man made) has a major role, so do all the planes making quite a crisis on their hands. Not only do they fight on the wing of a 747, but also fly a real helicopter on the wing of the plane also. The scene where McClane ejects himself from the exploding plane is another favourite scene of mine. Other parts of this movie which stunned me I wont tell you about as it will give too much away, but trust me they are exceptionally done.\n\nAgain the bad guys have a major role in this one. William Saddler is Colonial Stuart, a heartless leader, who only cares that a drug lord escapes and can get in on all the money making scheme. I loved his role in this. Another face that I remember in Die hard 2 who was a bad guy is Robert Patrick. I loved his role in Terminator 2. But the conflict between the good guys is extremely tense. Especially between McClane and Police Officer Lorenzo played by L.A law star Dennis Franz. It is hard to understand if this character is on the side for good or not. \n\nHere comes another analogy on Die Hard 2, do you ever know who is on the side of good or bad? Well for at least three quarters of the film it is unsure. The storywriters need to be commended because the story left me intrigued and when you think you know what is about to happen, the circumstances change. Also having a different director, gave this sequel new prospective. Director Renny Harlin threw his hand into the ring. What a gamble? An unknown director, but to my surprise I say that it worked. His other films worth mentioning include A Nightmare on Elm Street 4 and Cliffhanger. \n\nSo overall Die Hard 2 was extremely enjoyable sequel to watch. The story, the characters and the situation are all of a great tension, which I love in a movie. So one cop who is so vulnerable and emotional ends up being the one person who you would most like to have save your life. Like Willis said in an interview Die Hard 2 - Die Harder - it's bigger, badder and louder. I will leave you with one question, the first Die Hard had approximately 20 people die, can you count for me how many perish in this film? It is quite a turn around!\n\nRating: 4/5 or 9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":342228,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I think it was because I had gone into it expecting absolutely nothing. It's not the kind of movie that'll change your life, and you'll probably forget you had even seen it the next morning, but it's fun and lightweight, just as films in this genre should be.\n\nThe last week, I've gone a movie watching spree, watching at least eleven films in seven days, and this is probably the biggest treasure out of the bunch, if only because it was so much better than I had hoped. Angela's Ashes, The Running Man, Blow, Memento, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, Empire of the Sun, Paper Moon, Jacob's Ladder, Leaving Las Vegas, Along Came a Spider, The Stand, the list goes on and on, and, of all those films, this is the one that stands out... if you can believe that. Of course it had it's share of flaws, probably more than the rest of those movies combined, but hey, it just added to the fun instead of detract from it.\n\nI did see Look Who's Talking. I hated it. I hated it with a passion. That was a year ago. Why I hated it, I don't know. I just know that I didn't like it at all. The only reason I rented this movie, it's SECOND sequel, was to see how the series had deteriorated since the first film. Well, if nothing else, it's really improved. I haven't seen the second in the series, but I doubt it could even begin to match the third.\n\nOne can guess that Travolta didn't want to be here. You've gotta feel sorry for the guy. Once one of Hollywood's biggest stars, through the eighties he was reduced to parts in TV movies and bland films like The Experts. He struck box office gold in 1989 with the first Look Who's Talking, and then made a few wrong moves and was right back down at the bottom of Hollywood, even appearing in both of the sequels. Well, if he was bored here, he sure didn't show it. Though his performance seemed to wane a bit towards the end, he was engaging all the way through, and obviously didn't feel as though the material was below him like many actors would've had they been in his position.\n\nKirstie Alley, however, is entirely a different story. Never a particulary good actress, you have to wonder how she rose so high into Hollywood's elite, before plunging again after the first Look Who's Talking. Her screen presence here is non existent, and she is about as much fun to watch as this review probably is to read. Though she doesn't bring the whole film down with her, she comes pretty close at times, and for me at least, didn't garner a single laugh.\n\nAs the voices of the two dogs, Rocks and Daphne, Danny DeVito and Diane Keaton fare a lot better than Alley. Given some of the best lines in the film, they add a certain flare to their characters, making us believe that dogs actually can communicate with each other as illustrated here, even if it is clearly not possible. It takes real talent to make the audience believe that. Even if it is just through voice work, chemistry between the two is clearly evident, and you wish they had been given more scenes together, or even seperately. The writers seemed to forget about the dogs for long periods of time and focusing instead of the family, even though the movie was supposed to revolve around the dogs, at least according to the advertising.\n\nThough she is third billed, Olympia Dukakis has little more than a cameo, given five or six lines at the absolute most. Rounding out the main cast was the two actors who played Travolta and Alley's kids, David Gallagher as Mikey and Tabitha Lupien as Julie. Lupien is funny at times, especially with her obsession with basketball star Charles Barkley, but it's clear that was too young to really know what was going on, and just following the orders of the director. She did have some good lines, and that wide eyed gaze she had is priceless. Gallagher, who was later cast as one of the leads on the television series 7th Heaven, is impressive here, turning in a surprisingly good performance for someone so young. Though his character was shallow and obviously wasn't drawn out much (strange considering he's on screen for most of the movie), he makes good use of the weak material given to him.\n\nSpread out through the movie were five or six dream sequences. There's only one word to describe them, downright hilarious. Wait, that's two words. Oh well, they were really funny though. I'm not going to go through describing them, you'll have to see them for yourselves, but take my word on it, it doesn't get much funnier than that folks.\n\nWell, I've spent long enough praising the movie, now to the flaws I mentioned earlier. For one, I don't know if this was the fault of the boom operator or if it was my particular cassette, but the on location audio was dreadful. The voices were muffled and hard to understand, and it weakened the impact of many of the dialogue based jokes. Any chemistry between Travolta and Alley that may have existed in the first Look Who's Talking has vanished. Though many may not agree with me, I put the majority of the blame on Alley, who probably took this role only because of the paycheck.\n\nThe last third of the movie, especially the sappy happy ending, is contrived beyond belief and not the least bit funny. It's as if the producers hired a seperate writer for the ending, the style is that much different from the rest of the movie. The songs are unimaginably bad. Well, it's not so much the songs, but the obtrusive way they were edited in, with the audio levels at least 50% higher than the rest of the movie. I'm not going to drone on and on, like I already have, so I'll end this quick.\n\nLook Who's Talking Now is a surprisingly entertaining little movie, easily better than the lackluster first entry, just don't go in expecting too much (which shouldn't be too hard given the horrible reviews and low IMDb rating), because you're bound to be disappointed.\n\n7.5/10"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":28116,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.4},"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli's angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":280032,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Fortunately, that ain't the case. 'Notting Hill' is fun, sweet, intelligent and   well, simply said, very entertaining. London's Notting Hill does seem like a street you'd like to walk on.\n\nWhile the storyline itself is larger than life, the characters are real. There is no overt melodrama. We can see that Curtis put a lot of heart and some Brit wit humour into the writing. After meeting William, Anna, Spike, Max, Bella and Honey, we, as audience, really connect to these very interesting characters and care about them. The table discussion in Honey's birthday scene shows how all the characters connect. While a nervous Anna, is new to the group, we see that she eventually gets a hang of them and feels comfortable enough to talk about herself.\n\nHugh Grant isn't anything different from his other rom coms. Julia Roberts is brilliant. I never liked any of her romantic comedies (e.g. Pretty Woman, I Love Trouble, Something to Talk About etc) but 'notting Hill is an exception. She gives a subtle portrayal as hugely famous but very vulnerable Anna Scott and does full justice. This indeed is one of her finest performances. Rhys Ifans as Spike is standout! While Tim McInnerny, Emma Chambers, Hugh Bonneville and Gina McKee (love her) are excellent. McKee's comedy is extremely subtle and her character is one of the most appealing. She underplays her part with tremendous grace and maturity.\n\nAll the actors share a very warm chemistry that just keeps adding on to its quality. The relationship and friendship between the characters is shown in a very sensitive way. While Spike and William are roommates who just seem to get along, we know that they like each other. Also William is about to cancel a date with the world's most famous actress to attend his sister's birthday party. The relationship between Max and Bella is beautiful.\n\nAdditional credit must be given to Coulter's amazing cinematography and the visuals. Watch the scene where Thacker is walking through the market and we see the weather change (indicating the passing time). There's a beautiful soundtrack that recites the moods of the scenes. And last but not least, thanks to Roger Mitchell for putting it all together to tell us this sweet entertaining story."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":283973,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Fortunately, that ain't the case. 'Notting Hill' is fun, sweet, intelligent and   well, simply said, very entertaining. London's Notting Hill does seem like a street you'd like to walk on.\n\nWhile the storyline itself is larger than life, the characters are real. There is no overt melodrama. We can see that Curtis put a lot of heart and some Brit wit humour into the writing. After meeting William, Anna, Spike, Max, Bella and Honey, we, as audience, really connect to these very interesting characters and care about them. The table discussion in Honey's birthday scene shows how all the characters connect. While a nervous Anna, is new to the group, we see that she eventually gets a hang of them and feels comfortable enough to talk about herself.\n\nHugh Grant isn't anything different from his other rom coms. Julia Roberts is brilliant. I never liked any of her romantic comedies (e.g. Pretty Woman, I Love Trouble, Something to Talk About etc) but 'notting Hill is an exception. She gives a subtle portrayal as hugely famous but very vulnerable Anna Scott and does full justice. This indeed is one of her finest performances. Rhys Ifans as Spike is standout! While Tim McInnerny, Emma Chambers, Hugh Bonneville and Gina McKee (love her) are excellent. McKee's comedy is extremely subtle and her character is one of the most appealing. She underplays her part with tremendous grace and maturity.\n\nAll the actors share a very warm chemistry that just keeps adding on to its quality. The relationship and friendship between the characters is shown in a very sensitive way. While Spike and William are roommates who just seem to get along, we know that they like each other. Also William is about to cancel a date with the world's most famous actress to attend his sister's birthday party. The relationship between Max and Bella is beautiful.\n\nAdditional credit must be given to Coulter's amazing cinematography and the visuals. Watch the scene where Thacker is walking through the market and we see the weather change (indicating the passing time). There's a beautiful soundtrack that recites the moods of the scenes. And last but not least, thanks to Roger Mitchell for putting it all together to tell us this sweet entertaining story.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":283973,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There was a decent size crowd who seemed to enjoy it. For ESPN fans one of their long time personalities, who has his own video short series on the website, was there. But I digress.\n\nIt took a while to realize that it definitely was Dwayne Johnson as the astronaut's voice. He's created a great niche for himself in family films and I think he does good job. Justin Long was a good choice for the lead "alien" Lem and John Cleese is always a good choice as he did a small role as the professor. The role of Skiff brought good humor to many scenes. Sean William Scott was very animated in his voice acting for this character. Other than Rover and the hippie-like guy, the rest of the characters are just back drops without adding much.\n\nWe laughed quite a bit throughout the movie, which is mostly the point. There was plenty of cute humor with the dog-like robot Rover, who was a little reminiscent of WALL-E, a little. The down-side was that it never drew you in to fully connect, sympathize, like or dislike any of the characters. I didn't see myself rooting for anyone over anyone else. If the message is supposed to be about not judging anyone based on appearance, that message was shallow. If the message was to keep an open-mind toward what is possible and to learn new things, that message was under-developed.\n\nBottom line, the kids enjoyed it and we had a good entertaining night out. So in that respect it served its' purpose. The animation was suitable and I liked the 50's like theme of the planet. One or two adult humor jokes in there that could have been omitted and not change the movie.\n\nFor a family movie 7/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51793,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There was a decent size crowd who seemed to enjoy it. For ESPN fans one of their long time personalities, who has his own video short series on the website, was there. But I digress.\n\nIt took a while to realize that it definitely was Dwayne Johnson as the astronaut's voice. He's created a great niche for himself in family films and I think he does good job. Justin Long was a good choice for the lead "alien" Lem and John Cleese is always a good choice as he did a small role as the professor. The role of Skiff brought good humor to many scenes. Sean William Scott was very animated in his voice acting for this character. Other than Rover and the hippie-like guy, the rest of the characters are just back drops without adding much.\n\nWe laughed quite a bit throughout the movie, which is mostly the point. There was plenty of cute humor with the dog-like robot Rover, who was a little reminiscent of WALL-E, a little. The down-side was that it never drew you in to fully connect, sympathize, like or dislike any of the characters. I didn't see myself rooting for anyone over anyone else. If the message is supposed to be about not judging anyone based on appearance, that message was shallow. If the message was to keep an open-mind toward what is possible and to learn new things, that message was under-developed.\n\nBottom line, the kids enjoyed it and we had a good entertaining night out. So in that respect it served its' purpose. The animation was suitable and I liked the 50's like theme of the planet. One or two adult humor jokes in there that could have been omitted and not change the movie.\n\nFor a family movie 7/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":51793,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Everyone performed their parts well, Susan Sarandon has a minimal presence throughout the film yet is memorable.\n\nI'd have liked to have seen Ray/Ramona's mental instability addressed in the film as you never really understand why she wants to be a boy other than she's merely wanted it so since she was a little girl. Maybe that's all there is to it?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6207,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Ella Fanning displays great teenage angst - throwing tantrums, manipulation, sarcasm, selfishness, it's all there.\n\nNaomi Watts is the stand out, struggling to support her daughter's situation while juggling her own interesting relationships with her ex partners and mothers. Everyone performed their parts well, Susan Sarandon has a minimal presence throughout the film yet is memorable.\n\nI'd have liked to have seen Ray/Ramona's mental instability addressed in the film as you never really understand why she wants to be a boy other than she's merely wanted it so since she was a little girl. Maybe that's all there is to it?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6207,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But in the Japanese multimedia, it was stated by the Former Director Miyazaki and Producer Suzuki that the future successor was finally decided after watching Yonebayashi's first solo directed movie "When Marnie Was There (2014)". Was this really the case? My answer - Yes.\n\nThis movie is unique in a sense that the story revolves around two female protagonists "Anna" and "Marnie"; although it does remind us a hint of the nostalgic movie "My Neighbour Totoro" which starred "Satsuki" and "May", their relationship is far more complex. As the story progresses, their relationship becomes more clear and vivid to the audience, and the confusion of the intertwining reality and the dreamlike world starts to unfold. The two girls go on a journey as they discover each others past and dwells upon their current problems, and gradually develops an unbreakable bond that unites them stronger.\n\nAlthough the trailer did cause some confusing misunderstandings between the two girls in Japan, and at the same time my expectations lowered; after watching the movie it was no doubt a splendid and flawless piece of art both literally and figuratively.\n\nIt is worth noting that Yonebayashi truly challenged the impossible, as even Miyazaki had once thought of making this novel into a movie but had backed down due to its continuous complex changes that occur in the world of the two girls. Furthermore, Yonebayashi has created his "own" depiction of the sky in this movie, and is no longer the "blue sky" and "white clouds" that Miyazaki has portrayed in his series of work. So we can expect to see his own unique world of Ghibli gradually bloom in the next upcoming years.\n\nTo summarize the experience, it was astonishing how we, the audience ourselves can go on a journey together with the protagonists to overcome their obstacles. Paying attention to the changes in Anna's facial expressions is extremely crucial if you want to enjoy this movie. The succinct yet complex portrayal of these two girls really make you think of the depths of friendship.To conclude, I would like to end with Suzuki's logo that he had written for the advertising poster. The message of the logo is so sincere that to me there is no better way of epitomizing the message that the author and the director was trying to convey to the audience - 「あなたのことが大好き」- "I love you"; an unconditional love.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":34693,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is one of the very rare movies that is/should/will be equally interesting to teenagers, their parents and even grandparents. It seems a very simple little movie with no spectacular visual effects, car chases, or long and steamy sex scenes. Two young people in their early 20s, two college students (American tourist Ethan Hawke who is returning home after the summer in Europe and the French student Julie Delpy who goes to Paris to attend the classes in Sorbonne) meet on a train. They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli's angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":280032,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

They are attracted to each other instantly even before they start talking, they hop off the train in Vienna where they walk around exploring the city all night. They talk and fall in love. That's it, that's the movie. It could've been boring and silly but instead, it is a lovely, believable, clever, and moving romance that only gets better with each viewing (at least, for this viewer). High praise and my sincere gratitude go to the director and writers for delivering two charming characters, superb writing, always interesting and witty dialogs, two awesome performances, and the atmosphere of magic that falling in love is. Julie Delpy, who looks like a Botticelli's angel, is great in portraying smart, independent, and incredibly attractive young woman.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":280032,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The story goes: After doing a bit of alibi motorcycling in the introduction, Werner, Andi and their rocker friends discover that nasty building tycoon Günzelsen is planning to tear down their entire neighborhood. Of course, they do what they can to prevent it, and even involve Werner's boss, Röhrich, in their fight against Günzelsen. Suffice to say that this involves a bad impersonation of Hitler, Neo-Nazi feces and an apocalyptic sewer explosion. And that's really all there is to it, while the second film had stringent story around which it was constructed, this one simply lacks rigidity in telling the story.\n\nAs far as technology goes, the film is without flaw: combining conventional animation and state of the art computer technology, it looks really nifty, even better than hand-drawn part two.\n\nBut stars, toilet-humor and good computer effects alone don't make a good movie, as Hollywood found out long before.\n\nThe film really has it's moments, but they are too few and to far in between. Had the story been told in half the time, the film would have been great. The way it is, it is watchable, but that's it."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2477,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"duration":"PT1H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Regrettably not.","reviewBody":"The third cinematic installment of German cult cartoon figure Werner does, I have to say, not live up to the second film, yet really, it's not as bad as part one. The story goes: After doing a bit of alibi motorcycling in the introduction, Werner, Andi and their rocker friends discover that nasty building tycoon Günzelsen is planning to tear down their entire neighborhood. Of course, they do what they can to prevent it, and even involve Werner's boss, Röhrich, in their fight against Günzelsen. Suffice to say that this involves a bad impersonation of Hitler, Neo-Nazi feces and an apocalyptic sewer explosion. And that's really all there is to it, while the second film had stringent story around which it was constructed, this one simply lacks rigidity in telling the story.\n\nAs far as technology goes, the film is without flaw: combining conventional animation and state of the art computer technology, it looks really nifty, even better than hand-drawn part two.\n\nBut stars, toilet-humor and good computer effects alone don't make a good movie, as Hollywood found out long before.\n\nThe film really has it's moments, but they are too few and to far in between. Had the story been told in half the time, the film would have been great. The way it is, it is watchable, but that's it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2477,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"duration":"PT1H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
