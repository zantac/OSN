Overall Shadow is an exceptionally well made martial arts film, one that uses slow burn to a wonderful effect, never distancing itself from the viewer, but still able to build a strong hero and villain organically.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":13690,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It starts as a comedy, something you might expect because of the main actress, but soon the situations become real and more dramatic.\n\nThe rest of the cast includes well known actors like Alfred Molina, Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman and Margot Robbie.\n\nOverall: Don't expect a comedy because of Tina Fey. It starts like that but it evolves to other genres really quick. It might not be a great movie but it's not boring and you get something out of the inner journey of the protagonist. How easy is to feel unnatural situations as normal when you are a long way from home..."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50597,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"duration":"PT1H52M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It starts as a comedy, something you might expect because of the main actress, but soon the situations become real and more dramatic.\n\nThe rest of the cast includes well known actors like Alfred Molina, Billy Bob Thornton, Martin Freeman and Margot Robbie.\n\nOverall: Don't expect a comedy because of Tina Fey. It starts like that but it evolves to other genres really quick. It might not be a great movie but it's not boring and you get something out of the inner journey of the protagonist. How easy is to feel unnatural situations as normal when you are a long way from home...","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50597,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Making good on his word to get Bond back to reality, he mostly succeeded in making For Your Eyes Only a stripped back thriller. Gone is the over reliance on hi-tech wizardry, Moore (in his best performance as Bond) is back to being down to earth, being a Bond using his wits and toughness to get out of tricky situations, and the film goes for short sharp shock action scenes instead of giant battles enveloped by even bigger sets. There's much tension as well, none more so than with the finale, where again the big bang pyrotechnics have been replaced by a mountain peak accent and assault; where Bond uses a boot lace to save his skin!

Topol (charismatic and on scene stealing form) and Glover offer up fascinating characters, with Glover excellent as Kristatos, providing the franchise with a cultured and believable villain. Melina Havelock (Bouquet convincing) is tough and driven by revenge for her murdered parents, adept with a crossbow she makes a sturdy accomplice for Bond, and thankfully their union isn't bogged down mid mission by the "between the sheets" angle. Elsewhere, 007 editor John Glenn directs the first of his 5 Bond movies, impressive first outing with the underwater scenes particularly striking. Hume brings Corfu to life via his colour lenses and Conti oversees one of the series' best title theme songs, song with deep emotional beauty by Sheena Easton. His overall score is merely adequate, with decent nationalistic flavours, but the theme song is so strong it lingers to this day in the memory of all Bond fans.\n\nIt's not all great in this stripped back Bond world, though. The pre-credits sequence makes the terrible mistake of negating Bond's visit to the grave of his late wife, Tracy, by then having him jostle and jape with a bald villain in a wheelchair (is it meant to be Blofeld?): with unconvincing lines and delivery in the mix as well. Lynn-Holly Johnson's Bibi Dahl character is as pointless as it gets, out of place and superfluous to the plot. While some chase sequences, as fun and pulse raising as they are, are over extended and stretch the running time to longer than required. No mind, though, with Bond back to being a man again instead of a button pusher, and brilliant scenes like the keel-hauling peril, For Your Eyes Only was a major hit that raked in over $195 million at the World box office. James Bond's appeal, and that of the man playing him, was very much in vogue. 8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94367,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT2H7M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Most 12 year olds don't have a job. Perhaps their parents have assigned a few chores around the house to help them learn responsibility, but for the most part, they go to school and play ... the things that kids do. Shia LaBeouf had 2 jobs as a kid. He was a rising actor and he was employer/quasi-guardian of his father. Now in his 30's, LaBeouf has written a screenplay about his childhood and he stars as his father in an attempt to exorcise some personal demons. It also happens to make for compelling cinema.\n\nThe film opens with a montage of cuts between a 20-something LeBeouf (played by Oscar nominee Lucas Hedges) performing stunts on an action movie set (clearly meant to represent TRANSFORMERS) and a serious automobile wreck and subsequent DUI. The wreck caused major damage to his hand and resulted in court-mandated rehabilitation. While in rehab, his therapist (played by Laura San Giacomo) diagnoses him with PTSD ... not military war related, but rather broken family related.\n\nIn this film, LeBeouf has named the character based on himself Otis, and the character based on his own father James Lort. In addition to Hedges playing the early-20's version, another rising actor, Noah Jupe, plays Otis as a 12 year old. As rehabbing Otis puts his childhood memories to paper, we see flashbacks featuring the younger Otis and his father. They live in a dump of a motel, and ride to the TV show set (meant to be "Even Stevens") on dad's motorcycle. James Lort/dad is a former performing clown, recovering addict, and ex-con. He's the kind of guy who talks a big game and blames everyone else for keeping him from succeeding. To put it mildly ... he's a jerk. That's not to say he doesn't have his moments as a caring parent, but those moments are nullified by the bullying and threats of violence towards his young son. That son is desperate to please his dad, yet wise enough to know that he's not to be trusted.\n\nShia LeBeouf dives in head first to play the man who had such an impact on his early years. This, mind you, is the kind of man who offers cigarettes to his young son, makes fun of his pre-pubescent body, and is quite jealous of his budding career. LeBeouf is at his best in a difficult role that surely cuts very deep for him. Supporting roles are played by singer FKA Twigs as the shy neighbor girl who befriends Otis, plus Natasha Lyonne, Maika Monroe, Clifton Collins Jr, and Byron Bowers.\n\nDirector Alma Har'el structures her first narrative feature film (she has previously worked on videos and documentaries) with timelines showing Otis at the two ages. There are no fancy camera tricks. Instead she trusts these talented actors to bring it home ... and that they do very well. Lucas Hedges was Oscar nominated for MANCHESTER BY THE SEA, and he is in the beautiful upcoming film WAVES. Noah Jupe is a star in the making, having previously appeared in A QUIET PLACE, and in the exhilarating upcoming film FORD VS FERRARI. These are some top notch actors at their very best.\n\nAs viewers, we have to remove ourselves from feeling anger and disgust towards the James Lort character. That's easier said than done when he says things like "The only thing my father gave me of any value was pain." It's meant to sum up his reasoning for his own parenting approach. There is a truly brilliant, and well-coordinated scene that acts as a three-way phone conversation between father, son, and estranged wife/mother. The kid is put smack in the middle of the two people who are supposed to love and nurture and protect him. Instead, Otis comes across as the adult. We do get some comic relief with the 'world's first daredevil chicken', but this is just not a warm, cuddly father-son fairy tale. This was real life for Shia LeBeouf and he's brave to bring it out in the open, even if it's less confession and more therapeutic session. He deserves it after hearing, "I'm your cheerleader, Honey Boy", and "Trust me, I'm your father."","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is provocative, introspective, hopeful, and at times downright desolate. As evidenced by the opening sequence, the value of life itself is called into question and it sets the tone for the rest of the film.\n\nThe complex storyline focuses on one day in the lives of three women from three different generations.  Virginia Woolf (Nicole Kidman) is living outside of London with her husband in 1923, recovering from mental illness and beginning work on her now famous novel, Mrs. Dalloway.  Laura Brown (Julianne Moore) is a 1950's suburban housewife, married to a World War II veteran (John C. Reilly), raising a small boy while expecting another child. And then there is Clarissa Vaughn (Meryl Streep), a present-day version of Mrs. Dalloway, so named by her one-time lover and now AIDS-stricken writer Richard (Ed Harris), living in New York and planning one of her renowned parties for him following his reception of a prestigious poetry award.\n\n Yet there is a common thread among them that effaces any 'real' normalcy in their lives and ultimately forces each of them to make life-altering decisions.  Themes revolving around feminism and sexual preference stir just below the surface.  But it is the prevailing sadness of these women brought on by the confinements of a restrictive and often stifling society that is at the core of this film. Their yearning for something more or for that 'one perfect moment' in time places each of them in the painful position to question their own existence.  The sequences in each of their lives are carefully interwoven throughout the movie, enhancing their parallel struggles.\n\nThe Hours is skillfully directed by Stephen Daldry and contains some of the finest performances of the year.  Julianne Moore's depiction of Laura Brown is filled with subtlety and nuance.  She epitomizes a 1950's housewife with a constant shiny exterior who can barely contain the internal struggle of her life's claustrophobic confinements.  Meryl Streep's Clarissa Vaughn, though bound by memories of her past, is somewhat less restricted in her character as a modern New York editor living with her female lover and therefore has more opportunity to display her considerable emotional range.\n\nHowever it is Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Virginia Woolf that is the most mesmerizing and transforming performance in the film.  She is completely submerged as the famous novelist of the early twentieth century.  The hype concerning Kidman's prosthetic proboscis and its alleged distraction is much ado about nothing.  To the contrary, it enhances her performance and allows her characterization of Virginia Woolf to fully emerge.  Audiences will not recognize her, nor should they.\n\nBut if it is familiar players and plotlines you are seeking then The Hours is not for you.  It is neither fantasy nor escapism, yet what it lacks in pure entertainment it makes up for with introspection and a somewhat hopeful ending.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":126477,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

If you enjoy thoughtful film-making with a "less is more" approach, you'll be rewarded by a masterfully disturbing and shocking third act climax with an emotional kick that will give you closure but leave you thinking.

The movie is a slow burn which devotes the majority of its time to establishing the central 3 characters (impressive performances), who make up 3 generations of women from an old family in an old house in rural Victoria. If you enjoy thoughtful film-making with a "less is more" approach, you'll be rewarded by a masterfully disturbing and shocking third act climax with an emotional kick that will give you closure but leave you thinking. It should be noted though, just the like characters in Relic, you'll have to give attention to the people in front of you to reap the rewards.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":20574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

The first, and main problem, was the story. There were some times when it bared some resemblance to one of the best children's books ever written, up there with Peter Pan and the Hans Christian Anderson Fairy tales, for imagination and complexity. However, I especially disliked the dog meat factory subplot, that's where it got really clumsy and it made the climax feel really cluttered. The songs were also nothing to write home about. They were fun to listen to (especially the Weasel song), but they were definitely forgettable. The direction, by I think Terry Jones(also actor), lacked at times the director's usual silliness and fun. There were some scenes, like the train scene where the action felt a bit rushed. However, there were a number of redeeming qualities to the film. Some scenes, like the introduction to Rat, were beautifully shot, and reminded me of Three Men in a Boat. The sets and scenery are very colourful and pretty and the costumes didn't bother me all that much, admittedly though some of the special effects were so-so. The script was good, very witty at times, with some priceless lines especially with Toad, Badger and St John, while maintaining the book's gentleness and drollness which I liked. The performances were in general excellent especially Nicol Williamson as Badger, who brought a much needed gruffness to the character as well as having a gift for comedy. Steve Coogan was touching as Mole. Eric Idle and Terry Jones were very funny in their roles, Idle is wonderfully sympathetic and jovial while Jones has a ball as the juiciest character. The courtroom scene was hilarious because of Toad's increasingly silly breaking-into- song moments, and was the highlight of the film. John Cleese and Stephen Fry were good(Cleese especially), but their appearances were too brief. Anthony Sher was adequately menacing as Chief Weasel, but like everyone else involved, he has been better. All in all, a likable, colourful and funny but unfortunately at times clumsy film, with a 7/10.

As it is, it's a good film -- at times even a very good film -- and that's certainly no small achievement.\n\nDirector Ed Zwick, of course, is no David Lean -- though "Glory" and "Courage Under Fire" are excellent films ("Legends of the Fall" is decent, while I consider "Leaving Normal" one of the most mundane films ever made).   Here Zwick has attempted a traditional epic, and as with "Courage Under Fire", depicts the horrors of war through a story of personal redemption.  Into this basic story he also injects themes of honor, pride, cultural clashes and technological change versus ancient tradition.\n\nUnfortunately, though, no matter how lofty the ambitions, the bottom line here is that in order to transcend the fairly standard hero-goes-on-a-journey-and- undergoes-change plot that we've all seen many times before, something pretty new and special has to be added.  It's a little late to rehash the old "Searchers"/ "Emerald Forest"/"Dances With Wolves" tale of the white man being captured by enemies and siding with his captors -- unless it's aimed primarily at people who have never seen "The Searchers" or "The Emerald Forest" (Arthur Penn realized this thirty years ago, and made the hero and the journey of "Little Big Man" primarily comedic -- one of the main reasons the film works as well as it does).\n\nBut in the post-Altman/Ashby/Penn era -- where nearly all films -- especially action/adventure films -- have returned to the grandiose seriousness of their 1950s counterparts (with little or none of the wit and satire that crept through in the 60s and 70s), it is therefore pretty much expected that we will get the typical grandiose, serious, high-gloss and overlong treatment all the way through, with very little humor.  And that's too bad.  Because a lighter touch could have gone a long way towards getting the audience more involved, and making Cruise's character more likable (indeed, the few humorous lines and scenes he has are among the film's most memorable moments; they humanize his character and endear us to him).\n\nAnd this is one reason "The Last Samurai," despite a bunch of probable Oscars, is going to miss its target of becoming a beloved classic, an action/adventure epic for the ages.  Just as Sam Mendes did with "Road to Perdition," Zwick has tried a little too hard to impress.  By pouring on the big, movie-type moments, he merely reminds us that he's emulating the greatness of classic directors, without ever equaling them.  Zwick -- as I'm sure he will readily admit -- is merely a student of great filmmakers such as Lean or Kurosawa; he will likely never be one himself.  The sensibility just isn't there, the life experience is missing.\n\nCruise, similarly -- despite his talent -- will never be any kind of substitute for a Flynn or a Gable or a Bogart; Cruise is, after all, the kid from "Risky Business" who danced around in his underwear.  The grinning jock with the big nose from "Top Gun."  The goofball pool hustler from "The Color of Money."  The difference between someone like Cruise (or De Niro, or any of today's top stars) and a complex personality such as Stewart or Fonda or Bogart or Gable is simply immeasurable.  The heart and soul of those great actors is somehow missing from most of today's performers.  So by making a film like "The Last Samurai" in an old-fashioned, traditional way, it constantly invites comparison -- to great stars, to great directors, to the great age of studio filmmaking which, like the Samurai, is now gone -- never to return.\n\nThe sad fact is that the great movie-makers are dying off, leaving us with imitators, not originators.  In the last ten years we've lost Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Wilder, Frankenheimer, Fuller.  In the last six months alone we lost John Schlesinger and Elia Kazan.  Is anyone really expecting to see some sort of masterpiece by a T.V. producer/director named Ed Zwick?!\n\nStill, "The Last Samurai" manages to succeed in a number of ways -- mainly in presenting nineteenth-century Japan in a remarkably realistic way, and in its brutal battle scenes, shot in gory "Braveheart"-style by the great cinematographer John Toll.  It is in these terrifying, agonizing moments of sword-versus-rifle battle that Zwick comes closest to emulating his obvious hero, Akira Kurosawa, and manages to comment on the tragedy and insanity of war.\n\nFlashbacks are used unnecessarily to try to enforce Cruise's sense of guilt in participating in the the slaughter of the Indians (so we will understand his desire to defend another endangered species, the Samurai).  As the apparent title character, Ken Watanabe pretty much steals the show as Katsumodo, the sage warrior leader whom Cruise befriends.  A Japanese actress known only as Koyuki plays the heartbreakingly beautiful wife of a Samurai Cruise kills, who Cruise grows close to.  But perhaps most amazing of the Japanese cast is the small boy who plays one of her sons.  Unexpectedly expressive, emotional, and charming, he's the type of face you would expect to see in a film by the great Kurosawa.  Or Lean.  Or Ford.\n\nAll technical aspects, from production and costume design to visual effects, are excellent.  Hans Zimmer's score, incorporating traditional wood flutes and thunderous drums, is at times touching and evocative, at times bombastic and unnecessarily loud.   All in all, "The Last Samurai" is an impressive production. And even if it  misses being the cinematic classic it strives towards, all involved can be proud of their accomplishment.\n\nAnd whatever its faults, it's almost a miracle when a Hollywood studio today turns out something even a fraction this good.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":408782,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As it is, it's a good film -- at times even a very good film -- and that's certainly no small achievement.\n\nDirector Ed Zwick, of course, is no David Lean -- though "Glory" and "Courage Under Fire" are excellent films ("Legends of the Fall" is decent, while I consider "Leaving Normal" one of the most mundane films ever made).   Here Zwick has attempted a traditional epic, and as with "Courage Under Fire", depicts the horrors of war through a story of personal redemption.  Into this basic story he also injects themes of honor, pride, cultural clashes and technological change versus ancient tradition.\n\nUnfortunately, though, no matter how lofty the ambitions, the bottom line here is that in order to transcend the fairly standard hero-goes-on-a-journey-and- undergoes-change plot that we've all seen many times before, something pretty new and special has to be added.  It's a little late to rehash the old "Searchers"/ "Emerald Forest"/"Dances With Wolves" tale of the white man being captured by enemies and siding with his captors -- unless it's aimed primarily at people who have never seen "The Searchers" or "The Emerald Forest" (Arthur Penn realized this thirty years ago, and made the hero and the journey of "Little Big Man" primarily comedic -- one of the main reasons the film works as well as it does).\n\nBut in the post-Altman/Ashby/Penn era -- where nearly all films -- especially action/adventure films -- have returned to the grandiose seriousness of their 1950s counterparts (with little or none of the wit and satire that crept through in the 60s and 70s), it is therefore pretty much expected that we will get the typical grandiose, serious, high-gloss and overlong treatment all the way through, with very little humor.  And that's too bad.  Because a lighter touch could have gone a long way towards getting the audience more involved, and making Cruise's character more likable (indeed, the few humorous lines and scenes he has are among the film's most memorable moments; they humanize his character and endear us to him).\n\nAnd this is one reason "The Last Samurai," despite a bunch of probable Oscars, is going to miss its target of becoming a beloved classic, an action/adventure epic for the ages.  Just as Sam Mendes did with "Road to Perdition," Zwick has tried a little too hard to impress.  By pouring on the big, movie-type moments, he merely reminds us that he's emulating the greatness of classic directors, without ever equaling them.  Zwick -- as I'm sure he will readily admit -- is merely a student of great filmmakers such as Lean or Kurosawa; he will likely never be one himself.  The sensibility just isn't there, the life experience is missing.\n\nCruise, similarly -- despite his talent -- will never be any kind of substitute for a Flynn or a Gable or a Bogart; Cruise is, after all, the kid from "Risky Business" who danced around in his underwear.  The grinning jock with the big nose from "Top Gun."  The goofball pool hustler from "The Color of Money."  The difference between someone like Cruise (or De Niro, or any of today's top stars) and a complex personality such as Stewart or Fonda or Bogart or Gable is simply immeasurable.  The heart and soul of those great actors is somehow missing from most of today's performers.  So by making a film like "The Last Samurai" in an old-fashioned, traditional way, it constantly invites comparison -- to great stars, to great directors, to the great age of studio filmmaking which, like the Samurai, is now gone -- never to return.\n\nThe sad fact is that the great movie-makers are dying off, leaving us with imitators, not originators.  In the last ten years we've lost Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Wilder, Frankenheimer, Fuller.  In the last six months alone we lost John Schlesinger and Elia Kazan.

At the time Berenger was considered to be "the next big thing" and could do no wrong.\n\nIn my view, if you had suggested to Berenger at that time (hypothetically) that the rest of his career would be mainly TV roles, and that the occasional Sniper "redux" would be his only ongoing star turn, I think he would have been shocked.\n\nJust like this reviewer is shocked that, in spite of the cinematography and direction, this film essentially falls apart after the first 20 minutes.\n\nWhich is sad because Berenger, in his late sixties, might never get another chance to do this right.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4463,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Clooney and Pitt also do an OK job of an average script, but it never rises above OK.\n\nThe area i think this film falls down is with a cast that is too big, while inventive and different in the first film, just hinders this one. There are too many people trying to get their five minutes on screen to really give a damn. Maybe this is the directors feels we already care about them as we know the characters, when in reality the damage caused by twelve was enough to need character building again. Arguably a plot on a smaller scale would have been better with a sharp focus on one or two characters as in the first film.\n\nWhile flashy this film is all about style over substance and if you are looking for a shallow but entertaining summer movie this may just be it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":327960,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Clooney and Pitt also do an OK job of an average script, but it never rises above OK.\n\nThe area i think this film falls down is with a cast that is too big, while inventive and different in the first film, just hinders this one. There are too many people trying to get their five minutes on screen to really give a damn. Maybe this is the directors feels we already care about them as we know the characters, when in reality the damage caused by twelve was enough to need character building again. Arguably a plot on a smaller scale would have been better with a sharp focus on one or two characters as in the first film.\n\nWhile flashy this film is all about style over substance and if you are looking for a shallow but entertaining summer movie this may just be it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":327960,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Yes, seven. No, I'm not talking about the David Fincher directed thriller, nor am I referring to Samurai, Dwarfs or the lucky number. In this context, seven denotes the number of wince inducing minutes it takes for Lakeview Terrace to throw it all away.\n\nParticular genres of movies tend to have a nasty propensity to ruin their final acts, the foremost of those being thrillers and horror films. May it be an amateur director not knowing how to complete their vision, studio intervention sucking the life from the screen or the commonly occurring revelatory "shocker" ending which tries to jam too many ideas in the viewer's already bleeding sockets. Oddly, director Neil LaBute's latest offering does not succumb to a conventional destructive timeline, but instead opts to cataclysmically implode in literally the final scenes, a feat which few films can boast. Perhaps I am being an iota harsh, as I am recommending this film and the majority of this review will be skewed favourably, but chiefly, my unbounded feelings of contempt towards the finale should stand as a testament to their standalone absurdity which contrasts harshly with the preceding 90 or so minutes.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson has had a vibrant career portraying characters in two spectrums of the acting realm. On one side we have his depictions that can be lumped into the loud-mouthed anti-hero category (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard with a Vengeance, Snakes on a Plane), and on the other, his more nuanced (as nuanced as Sam Jackson can be) roles. (Black Snake Moan, Resurrecting the Champ, Coach Carter) Lakeview Terrace to some extent blurs this boundary, but for the most part Jackson plays his role straight, and he is very good because of it. Jackson plays Abel Turner a veteran, but widowed LAPD officer who lives his daughter Celia (Regine Nehy) and Son Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) on Lakeview Terrace in the hills. He is strict to be sure and his protective nature sometimes obscures the obvious affection for his children. It is touches like this, and similar additions by LaBute that makes his character all the more menacing when the tension later builds, as he is not so much a faceless villain, but a deeply flawed everyman. Despite an encroaching wildfire, things are routine on Lakeview; Abel patrols the neighbourhood at night, loves his job and wants nothing more then to protect his family. Things change however when a new couple move in next door. The fact that husband Chris (Patrick Wilson) wife Lisa (Keri Washington) are interracial is only the fuel for Abel's contempt, and when his children witness a late-night skinny dip by these two newlyweds, the fire erupts and Abel and Chris' lives spiral out of control.\n\nFashioning Abel as a cop is an intelligent choice, as per the television advertisements indicate, what are they going to do, and who are the authorities going to believe; who will police the police indeed. The tension for the duration is so high, you don't even need a knife to cut it, and a definite sense of dread and menace perforates the narrative. LaBute, truthfully, makes few mistakes, he allows for character development, and as I mentioned not just regarding Chris and Lisa, lets the story develop at a slow burning pace, with the hillside fires mirroring the escalating tempers. The story is also far more insightful and caring then I ever would have anticipated regarding the complicated issue of race and marriage, without feeling shoehorned into the thriller template. As you can clearly discern I have a fairly large amount of admiration for Lakeview Terrace, which brings me to the ending.\n\nFew endings I have seen have represented such a radical shift in tone, and made its characters undertake such ridiculous and uncharacteristic actions then we see here; and I assure you it is jarring. The immediately preceding act, is an iota off kilter with the acts preceding, but does not draw attention and properly illustrates the consequences when things are taken too far in the name of retribution. I was fully under the impression that things were going to end sharply until Abel's character jolts erratically from intelligent saboteur to volcanic lunatic and makes a series of choices that are against both his nature, and what the audience would want to see transpire. Either Abel lost his mind, or the director did. Those who seek out this film in theatres may be disappointed and feel the conclusion somehow managed to bilk them out of their cash like a sneaky pickpocket. LaBute's finale does not so much embody a slap in the face, but a swift hard kick to the groin.\n\nRead all my reviews at Simon Says Movies: http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

(Black Snake Moan, Resurrecting the Champ, Coach Carter) Lakeview Terrace to some extent blurs this boundary, but for the most part Jackson plays his role straight, and he is very good because of it. Jackson plays Abel Turner a veteran, but widowed LAPD officer who lives his daughter Celia (Regine Nehy) and Son Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) on Lakeview Terrace in the hills. He is strict to be sure and his protective nature sometimes obscures the obvious affection for his children. It is touches like this, and similar additions by LaBute that makes his character all the more menacing when the tension later builds, as he is not so much a faceless villain, but a deeply flawed everyman. Despite an encroaching wildfire, things are routine on Lakeview; Abel patrols the neighbourhood at night, loves his job and wants nothing more then to protect his family. Things change however when a new couple move in next door. The fact that husband Chris (Patrick Wilson) wife Lisa (Keri Washington) are interracial is only the fuel for Abel's contempt, and when his children witness a late-night skinny dip by these two newlyweds, the fire erupts and Abel and Chris' lives spiral out of control.\n\nFashioning Abel as a cop is an intelligent choice, as per the television advertisements indicate, what are they going to do, and who are the authorities going to believe; who will police the police indeed. The tension for the duration is so high, you don't even need a knife to cut it, and a definite sense of dread and menace perforates the narrative. LaBute, truthfully, makes few mistakes, he allows for character development, and as I mentioned not just regarding Chris and Lisa, lets the story develop at a slow burning pace, with the hillside fires mirroring the escalating tempers. The story is also far more insightful and caring then I ever would have anticipated regarding the complicated issue of race and marriage, without feeling shoehorned into the thriller template. As you can clearly discern I have a fairly large amount of admiration for Lakeview Terrace, which brings me to the ending.\n\nFew endings I have seen have represented such a radical shift in tone, and made its characters undertake such ridiculous and uncharacteristic actions then we see here; and I assure you it is jarring. The immediately preceding act, is an iota off kilter with the acts preceding, but does not draw attention and properly illustrates the consequences when things are taken too far in the name of retribution. I was fully under the impression that things were going to end sharply until Abel's character jolts erratically from intelligent saboteur to volcanic lunatic and makes a series of choices that are against both his nature, and what the audience would want to see transpire. Either Abel lost his mind, or the director did. Those who seek out this film in theatres may be disappointed and feel the conclusion somehow managed to bilk them out of their cash like a sneaky pickpocket. LaBute's finale does not so much embody a slap in the face, but a swift hard kick to the groin.\n\nRead all my reviews at Simon Says Movies: http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49827,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

They still have that great chemistry together as before and the story of the movie is not a happy one but its pretty realistic look of a marriage slowly deteriorating. Leonardo DiCaprio is good as always as Frank Wheeler and Kate Winslet is just as impressive playing his wife April who seem to have to be the perfect family with the house, the kids, and a good paycheck living in a Connecticut suburb in the 1950's. But appearances aren't always what they appear to be in this film directed by Sam Mendes. The man behind films like Road To Perdition, American Beauty, and Jardhead. He's also the husband of Kate Winslet. Mendes does another admirable job of bringing this tragic love story of the Wheelers to the big screen. DiCaprio and Winslet are fantastic portraying two people who do love each other but can't seem to make their marriage work. Dicaprio and Winslet disappear into their roles becoming those characters making you care about them and hoping they succeed. They both continue to show their amazing talent in this film. Kathy Bates turns in a decent performance as well but her character isn't it that much. She shows up for brief appearances here and there because the main focus is on Leo and Kate. Michael Shannon is the only one to standout in the rest of the supporting cast who do a good in their roles as well. Shannon plays John Givings a troubled man who says whats on his mind without thinking twice about it and is the only one who can see right through the Wheelers. Shannon may not get a lot of screen time but he does a great job in the small role he has in the movie. He's also the son of the character played by Bates. The scenes where DiCaprio and Winslet lash out at each other are done well you can feel the tension between them growing with each passing moment as their arguments escalate. The period setting fits with the tone of the film and everything in it looked realistic giving audiences a look at what things were like back then. There are two sex scenes both involving Winslet so parents should be warned but none of them are too explicit like Monster's Ball, Original Sin, or Little Children to name a few. The pacing for the movie was a little slow at times but the good more than outweighs the bad in Revolutionary Road. The movie doesn't have your typical Hollywood ending but thats one of things I liked it about because life doesn't always have a happy ending. Overall Revolutionary Road was better than expected it's a tragic love story brought to life because of the exceptional performances from both Dicaprio and Winslet who make the film worth the time to watch.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201628,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Director Shane Black loved the term and chose it as the movie's title because, "it so clearly represented what this film is." And what exactly is this film? Good question. For starters, it's original. It's a nice change of pace from all of the sequels and remakes we've been inundated with recently. I needed this breath of fresh air after being blind-sided by the news that a remake of Robocop might be on its way.\n\nIt's also funny and action-packed. The pace comes at us almost as quickly as the clever dialogue, making it nearly impossible for the average viewer to get bored. You may be offended, you may not appreciate the dark humor, and you may not get the style, but I would predict the majority of you won't get bored. Will I refund your ticket money if you *do* get bored? No, absolutely not. Don't be silly. I'll just say, "Oh well, I guess you're just in the minority on this one!" What I like most about Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is it's so hard to "genre-lize." See what I did there? Add that term to the Movie Mark Dictionary. When you can't "genre-lize" something then you can't easily force it into any one specific genre. Clever, huh? That's what makes Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang so fun. Is there action? Yes! After all, it's by the same guy who wrote the Lethal Weapon movies. But it's not an action movie.\n\nIs there humor? Indeed. The laughs mostly come from the chemistry between Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. and some of the crazy situations they find themselves in. This is my kind of dark humor. I love to be caught off guard by unexpected moments that make me laugh at things that might not be so funny if they were witnessed in the real world. But this isn't a comedy. The humor is never forced and doesn't have to resort to slapstick or flatulent puppies just to get cheap laughs. Sure, there's a scene that involves peeing on a corpse, but it has to be seen in its context to be appreciated.\n\nIf I were forced to affix a label to this then I suppose I'd say it's a darkly comedic murder mystery. It takes itself just seriously enough to keep you in suspense, but it's irreverent enough to simply be fun and entertaining. It works well enough as a farce without ever coming off as a pure parody.\n\nMy main complaint is that the story does get a little too confusing. I admit that I openly mocked other reviews that called the story "needlessly complex," but now that I have seen it I totally understand what these reviews are talking about. You'll want to pay careful attention or you'll get lost pretty quickly. I'd even suggest taking notes. If you're not careful you'll become so immersed with keeping up with the rapid-fire dialogue that you could lose focus on the plot details. It's not mind-blowing, but there are just so many characters and minutiae to keep up with that it's easy to lose track of what exactly is going on. If your friends call you "ol' goldfish attention span" then you could be in trouble.\n\nI'm not going to lie to you and tell you that this movie is for everybody. The language gets pretty rough, there is strong sexual content, Val Kilmer is a detective who just happens to be gay and jokes are made at his expense, there's a decent amount of gunplay, and some people just might not appreciate the unconventionality on display.\n\nBut I loved the fact that this wasn't formulaic and that the look and style was different than the norm. Black admits to de-saturating the colors in post-production to give the film a crude, rough look. Perhaps some might like their movies a little more bright, but I thought it was quite effective at giving the film the pulp detective story vibe that Black was going for.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this to my mother, so I won't pretend to know whether this fits *your* taste either. It all depends on how you view these kinds of things. Is it gratuitous or knowingly over-the-top? Clever or too clever for its own good? Cheesy or comfortable in its self-awareness? Ask yourself what it takes to offend your senses and let that be your guide.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":218046,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"duration":"PT1H43M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Director Shane Black loved the term and chose it as the movie's title because, "it so clearly represented what this film is." And what exactly is this film? Good question. For starters, it's original. It's a nice change of pace from all of the sequels and remakes we've been inundated with recently. I needed this breath of fresh air after being blind-sided by the news that a remake of Robocop might be on its way.\n\nIt's also funny and action-packed. The pace comes at us almost as quickly as the clever dialogue, making it nearly impossible for the average viewer to get bored. You may be offended, you may not appreciate the dark humor, and you may not get the style, but I would predict the majority of you won't get bored. Will I refund your ticket money if you *do* get bored? No, absolutely not. Don't be silly. I'll just say, "Oh well, I guess you're just in the minority on this one!" What I like most about Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang is it's so hard to "genre-lize." See what I did there? Add that term to the Movie Mark Dictionary. When you can't "genre-lize" something then you can't easily force it into any one specific genre. Clever, huh? That's what makes Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang so fun. Is there action? Yes! After all, it's by the same guy who wrote the Lethal Weapon movies. But it's not an action movie.\n\nIs there humor? Indeed. The laughs mostly come from the chemistry between Val Kilmer and Robert Downey Jr. and some of the crazy situations they find themselves in. This is my kind of dark humor. I love to be caught off guard by unexpected moments that make me laugh at things that might not be so funny if they were witnessed in the real world. But this isn't a comedy. The humor is never forced and doesn't have to resort to slapstick or flatulent puppies just to get cheap laughs. Sure, there's a scene that involves peeing on a corpse, but it has to be seen in its context to be appreciated.\n\nIf I were forced to affix a label to this then I suppose I'd say it's a darkly comedic murder mystery. It takes itself just seriously enough to keep you in suspense, but it's irreverent enough to simply be fun and entertaining. It works well enough as a farce without ever coming off as a pure parody.\n\nMy main complaint is that the story does get a little too confusing. I admit that I openly mocked other reviews that called the story "needlessly complex," but now that I have seen it I totally understand what these reviews are talking about. You'll want to pay careful attention or you'll get lost pretty quickly. I'd even suggest taking notes. If you're not careful you'll become so immersed with keeping up with the rapid-fire dialogue that you could lose focus on the plot details. It's not mind-blowing, but there are just so many characters and minutiae to keep up with that it's easy to lose track of what exactly is going on. If your friends call you "ol' goldfish attention span" then you could be in trouble.\n\nI'm not going to lie to you and tell you that this movie is for everybody. The language gets pretty rough, there is strong sexual content, Val Kilmer is a detective who just happens to be gay and jokes are made at his expense, there's a decent amount of gunplay, and some people just might not appreciate the unconventionality on display.\n\nBut I loved the fact that this wasn't formulaic and that the look and style was different than the norm. Black admits to de-saturating the colors in post-production to give the film a crude, rough look. Perhaps some might like their movies a little more bright, but I thought it was quite effective at giving the film the pulp detective story vibe that Black was going for.\n\nI wouldn't recommend this to my mother, so I won't pretend to know whether this fits *your* taste either. It all depends on how you view these kinds of things. Is it gratuitous or knowingly over-the-top? Clever or too clever for its own good? Cheesy or comfortable in its self-awareness? Ask yourself what it takes to offend your senses and let that be your guide.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":218046,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

All 3 seasons","reviewBody":"This has been one of the best TV series out there in a while, well done, imaginative and well-acted. The first season was fantastic, but then I stopped watching the second season because it seemed too chaotic and different from what it originally was. But then I picked it up again, and understood it better.\n\nI think the show can be disappointing because each season is very different from the previous and it's sometimes hard to follow along (especially with Bernard's memory lapses that we have to make sense of). But if you go into the show expecting it will be a completely new world, with only the old familiar faces, you learn to enjoy it.\n\nThe first season is about Dolores gaining her consciousness and realizing she lives in a brutal, ugly world. In the second season Dolores embraces the darkness to destroy her world (Westworld) to lead her people to something new, where they can be free. In the third season, once she is free, she discovers mankind to have the same predicament as the hosts in Westworld, and she sets about to destroy the world, based on what she had become and what she had learned in Westworld, with a similar drive and goal that led her to destroy Westworld. That is the overall plot, without getting into spoilers.\n\nI enjoyed the third season, actually. It wasn't Westworld, but a reflection of it, and all the pieces do tie together but it is hard to follow at times and keep track of the details. But I thought future world was clever, with how the machine keeps track of everyone, just like in some ways the world around us kind of does today to get us to think and act in a certain way, until we ask ourselves: who are we?\n\nIt's certainly not perfect. I think the show expects humans to be a lot more violent, ruthless, and uncaring than they actually are. In Westworld it made sense: the creators of the world were all pretty evil, and the robots were the real humans. But out in the real world, a little less violence and a little more mundane and understanding with fewer guns I think would have been OK.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":442857,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

To my surprise, it did not disappoint.\n\nNow, several years later after having watched all three of these "Rings" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the "Fellowship" film.\n\nAnyway, "Fellowship," stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what?

To my surprise, it did not disappoint.\n\nNow, several years later after having watched all three of these "Rings" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the "Fellowship" film.\n\nAnyway, "Fellowship," stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.\n\nThe story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on.

I also haven't seen this ballet on the stage and won't be able to compare it.\n\n1. Actors play. Francesca Hayward looked essential in her role - young, naive, and delicate. Juliets feelings are understandable event there is no single line. The character is fully uncovered and understandable. Unfortunately, all others do not bring the same feelings. I didn't get the temper, intentions, and philosophy of any other character. Random face mimics, characters appear and disappear, randomly their mood is changed without a clear reason why. Without lines, the only cinema language here would be - face mimics, body moves, and music. Neither faces nor bodies told me a story.\n\n2. Choreography. Impressed with Francesca again. Probably if there were more solos of each main character - I would understand them better. But everything was mixed in a chaotic way + hard to follow because of really bad camera work.\n\n3. Camera &amp; Film editing. Dance scenes were often cut... I can see a dancer in a medium shot at the beginning and suddenly his legs are partially cut? Then I can see a close-up of the static face with no emotions while they dance? Lots of close-ups are just not justified and useless. While the dance is missed. Framing. In the scene when Juliet dances for Romeo - she is cut, the rule of thirds again failed, lots of people close/around her, and no Romeo. We can see him montaged in close-ups a couple of times... I want to see both actors in the same medium shot scene. The tension between them and do not care about other people's faces. They are secondary. But instead, Juliet looks standalone. In close-ups, faces are often... blurred. If that was on purpose - then I didn't get the point.\n\n4. Music. All fans would hate me here. But, in 2020 we might need more tragedy in really sad moments. For example - the finale scene. Romeo died and Juliet wakes up - light and delicate music (Yes, I am sorry for not knowing what is the title of this composition). Then she sees Romeo and her face screams - but the music is the same. The mood is changed - but the sound remains the same. I can't share her pain with the kind and optimistic composition.\n\nIn general, I love the idea. I would not watch it again because of the camera and editing.

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long "suffering" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.\n\n I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":421122,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

She's great as Magnus, not overdone, but sensitive, slightly badass and played right. She has a daughter, Ashley. She's instantly likable and Emelie Ullerup doesn't fall into the trap of making her the typical blond 'Yeah, uhuh I like totally, like, kick- ass. Isn't that cool!' character. Instead she's much better and thankfully without a teenage crisis. I'll get onto Robin Dunne's excellent Will in a sec.\n\nSanctuary is more than just the sum of its parts. It has a great grittiness to it, a real world, almost familiar environment. It's slightly dark, but optimistic at the same part. 30 minutes into the pilot and I really liked it. Will was believable, I even liked and sympathised with him. the way it was done felt like a feature, not really like an hour long weekly show. The whole actual Sanctuary concept wasn't done too fantastically. However I felt it wasn't perfect but it's taken me 2 more episodes to think that actually it's worth continuing to watch.\n\nFor Brits, its on ITV 4, mondays at 9. Or 8. Pretty sure it's 9, but check. if you don't have ITV 4, it's on their catch up thing on the site. For Americans it's on Hulu and Sci Fi's Rewind.\n\nHave fun getting into it, looking forward to see where it goes.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19555,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

She's great as Magnus, not overdone, but sensitive, slightly badass and played right. She has a daughter, Ashley. She's instantly likable and Emelie Ullerup doesn't fall into the trap of making her the typical blond 'Yeah, uhuh I like totally, like, kick- ass. Isn't that cool!' character. Instead she's much better and thankfully without a teenage crisis. I'll get onto Robin Dunne's excellent Will in a sec.\n\nSanctuary is more than just the sum of its parts. It has a great grittiness to it, a real world, almost familiar environment. It's slightly dark, but optimistic at the same part. 30 minutes into the pilot and I really liked it. Will was believable, I even liked and sympathised with him. the way it was done felt like a feature, not really like an hour long weekly show. The whole actual Sanctuary concept wasn't done too fantastically. However I felt it wasn't perfect but it's taken me 2 more episodes to think that actually it's worth continuing to watch.\n\nFor Brits, its on ITV 4, mondays at 9. Or 8. Pretty sure it's 9, but check. if you don't have ITV 4, it's on their catch up thing on the site. For Americans it's on Hulu and Sci Fi's Rewind.\n\nHave fun getting into it, looking forward to see where it goes.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19555,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

But now I'm not so sure. Mildred Hayes, the heroine from 'Three Billboards', is a serious contender. This might well be her best performance ever.\n\nThe part of Mildred Hayes was written with McDormand in mind. Hayes is a divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of a small, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped and killed on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by the lack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent three dilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief of incompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media, angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasingly violent actions.\n\nAlthough the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes' stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.\n\nApart from McDormand's performance, the screenplay is another great feature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, gradually shifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. None of the characters are one-dimensional: they all reveal surprising parts of their personalities as the story moves forward.\n\nAnd then there is the overall, almost Coen-esque atmosphere of a small town full of colourful characters. There is a racist cop, a friendly midget, a smart advertising guy and a pretty girl who is so dumb she doesn't know the difference between polo and polio.\n\nIt is hard to mention something negative about this film. 'Three Billboards' is, from start to finish, a great movie. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":455574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But now I'm not so sure. Mildred Hayes, the heroine from 'Three Billboards', is a serious contender. This might well be her best performance ever.\n\nThe part of Mildred Hayes was written with McDormand in mind. Hayes is a divorced single mother, living with her son on the outskirts of a small, remote town. She had a daughter too, but the girl was raped and killed on a quiet mountain road not far from home. Frustrated by the lack of progress of the investigation, Hayes decides to rent three dilapidated billboards, publicly accusing the local police chief of incompetence. By doing so, she attracts the attention of the media, angers almost the entire town and causes a succession of increasingly violent actions.\n\nAlthough the film is about grief, anger, revenge and violence, it is extremely funny. Above all because of Mildred Hayes' stubborn character and her ability to verbally humiliate people by her extremely sharp tongue. The monologue she delivers when a priest visits her house to tell her she has gone too far, is priceless.\n\nApart from McDormand's performance, the screenplay is another great feature of this film. The story is full of unexpected twists, gradually shifting the positions of the main characters towards each other. None of the characters are one-dimensional: they all reveal surprising parts of their personalities as the story moves forward.\n\nAnd then there is the overall, almost Coen-esque atmosphere of a small town full of colourful characters. There is a racist cop, a friendly midget, a smart advertising guy and a pretty girl who is so dumb she doesn't know the difference between polo and polio.\n\nIt is hard to mention something negative about this film. 'Three Billboards' is, from start to finish, a great movie. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":455574,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

    <desc lang="pl">Członkowie dwupokoleniowej rodziny próbują żyć ze świadomością o jej rozpadzie. Niektórzy starają się to akceptować i trwać w takiej rzeczywistości, a inni chcą się z niej wydostać. Liczne problemy, rozpadające się związki i rozwody negatywnie wpływają na stosunki międzyludzkie. Wszystko to odbija się na dzieciach, które w ten sposób tracą szansę na normalny rozwój. Przedstawiana historia widziana jest z perspektywy małego dziecka, obserwującego zachowania swoich rodziców. Rozgrywający się dramat ojca Janusza (Grzegorz Juchiewicz) uwidacznia bezsilność w bezwiednie zapoczątkowanej autodestrukcji.</desc>

Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Thankfully, it's very clear that this adaptation was updated for the modern age, which felt like a strong enough reason when watching it. Now, I'll be very upfront with this before diving into my review and state that I don't have any knowledge of this classic material, prior to viewing this movie, so it felt pretty fresh to me. For that reason, you may want to take this review with a grain of salt, but here's why I believe the 2019 version of Little Women is worth your time.\n\nFlashing back and forth between time periods, the focal point of this film is Jo March (Saoirse Ronan) and her writing ambitions. The film begins and concludes with her story, but the rest of the movie places her sisters Meg (Emma Watson), Amy (Florence Pugh), and Beth (Eliza Scanlen) at the forefront as well. All trying to find a man to love and discovering what love truly is, these young women strive to become something greater than how they grew up. Diving into very emotional struggles as the film goes on, there is quite a bit of depth to this story. Loss and relationships are what kept this film emotionally resonant with me and I believe the care that was put into the characters is what made it work so well.\n\nIt doesn't hurt that the cast was so well constructed, but I believe the shining star here is director Greta Gerwig. Although I feel that this is a very solid film like all of her previous works (as she has yet to blow me away), she definitely seems to be improving, every single time she steps behind the camera. This is her best film to date in my opinion. The way she was able to bring such raw and realistic performances out of these actresses was amazing. Timothee Chalamet is also an actor on the rise to super-stardom and his presence here was nothing short of fantastic either.\n\nLittle Women is filled with some very well-done cinematography by Yorick Le Saux and I also found Nick Houy's editing style to be pretty special as well. With that said, the main thing that deterred me from loving this film was the pacing. There are times, especially throughout the majority of the second act where the movie seemed to really slow down. Yes, these moments were buoyed by effective drama, but I found myself waiting for the next scene to come on a few occasions. This is a wonderful film that I just found to be a little too slow.\n\nIn the end, although the pacing of this movie did hurt my experience a little, which doesn't usually happen with slow-paced films, I still was able to really admire it. Little Women is a fantastic effort by director Greta Gerwig and many of the technical aspects stood out to me as well. Quick shout out to the set design and costume work as well, as those will probably be worth of awards very soon. This is a wonderful movie from start to finish and it deserves all the praise it's receiving, but I just didn't quite love it myself. Still, it's a very good movie nonetheless.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":156159,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"duration":"PT2H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

However, the material he was given to work with was not as good as Silence of the Lambs.  In fairness, perhaps there was no way it could be.  In SOTL, he was somehow more foreboding, more of a sort of superhuman monster; in Hannibal, he's more accessible, a guy you meet on the street.  Maybe it was impossible to maintain the mystery of Lecter that we saw in SOTL because of the risk of doing a rehash.  I'd give the overall Dr Lecter character a 9 of 10 in this film, vs. a 10 of 10 in the last one.  Not quite as good, but still very good.\n\nStarling's character, on the other hand, fell flat in this film.  In SOTL, Foster perfectly portrayed Starling's flat surface with a turbulent depth; in Hannibal, there was nothing under her surface.  Foster's Clarice evoked feelings of sympathetic grief, Moore's Clarice evoked nothing.  I do not necessarily blame Moore, this could be due to writing and/or directing. Obviously, though SOTL focused mainly on Starling's character, Hannibal focuses on, well, Hannibal.  Still, that's no excuse for what was done to Starling.  Her character gets a 3 of 10.\n\nThe story was much weaker in Hannibal than in SOTL.  It almost seemed like an excuse to present us with the characters, rather than a story in and of itself.  Still, it had no other major flaws, so it gets a 6 of 10.\n\nNow, there's another category I'll call the shock factor.  It's different than ordinary gore, it's... creative gore.  The sick, disgusting depravity we expect to see and like to see in this type of film.  I can't go into detail without spoiling it, but I'll have to say it goes even beyond what I expected.  Do not watch this film if you are squeamish or dislike gore. There isn't a lot of gore in the film, but what there was, was... concentrated.

And yes, there is a dark and stormy knight.\n\nThe movie is so bad I found myself rooting for Loki, hoping he would kill Thor as soon as possible, so that the movie would finally end. But no such luck. It kept going on, and on, and on, and... I almost wish I could have knocked myself out with the hammer of invincibility.\n\nThere's 90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2741,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":1.7},"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Special effects look like special defects, acting is so bad (except for Loki-nothing outstanding, but he looks like a genius compared to the others), it's to cry for, the plot is so simplistic it's almost scary, the dialogs are way beyond cliché, and most of the movie looks like it was filmed in a back lot. And yes, there is a dark and stormy knight.\n\nThe movie is so bad I found myself rooting for Loki, hoping he would kill Thor as soon as possible, so that the movie would finally end. But no such luck. It kept going on, and on, and on, and... I almost wish I could have knocked myself out with the hammer of invincibility.\n\nThere's 90 minutes of my life that I'll never get back.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2741,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":1.7,"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

    <desc lang="pl">Były snajper armii amerykańskiej, sierżant Thomas Beckett (Tom Berenger) zgadza się na propozycję agentów rządowych, dotyczącą wyjazdu z samobójczą misją na Bałkany. Jego zadaniem jest zlikwidowanie serbskiego generała oskarżonego o ludobójstwo. Na jego prośbę towarzyszy mu skazany na śmierć więzień Cole (Bokeem Woodbine). Dla niego ta niebezpieczna wyprawa jest szansą na ocalenie życia i odzyskanie wolności. Po przybyciu na miejsce od razu wpadają w tarapaty. W końcu Beckett odkrywa, że zostali wysłani na pewną śmierć i posłużyli tylko za narzędzie osób, które im tę misję zleciły. Postanawia za wszelką cenę i z wykorzystaniem wszystkich możliwych środków się zemścić. Nie zamierza oszczędzić nawet wpływowych i wysoko postawionych osób. Kontynuacja dramatu sensacyjnego Luisa Llosa z 1993 roku.</desc>

Carley (Snow) is about to graduate from college and her father isn't interested in attending. Lena (Serratos) just found out that her boyfriend is cheating on her. Dre (Ross) just found out that he will be able to graduate high school and finally has found a way out of gang life. Kevin (Trautmann) wants nothing more then to join a gang. When him and Dre get into an argument that ends up in carjacking the car that belongs to Carley with Lena has a passenger. The best way to describe this is "Crash" with teens. Total strangers who are all connected by one event that threatens to ruin all of them. This is very moving, powerful and intense. I highly recommend this one but much like "Crash" it's not really one you can watch over and over. The acting is great and the movie is a mix of flashbacks and current events that really make you feel connected to the characters and find your self sad and angry all at once. Overall, a surprisingly good movie that deserves to be watched. I give it a B+","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3184,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I liked it much more then I expected to. Pretty emotional and powerful. A good watch. I say B+","reviewBody":""I never should have gotten out of bed this morning." Carley (Snow) is about to graduate from college and her father isn't interested in attending. Lena (Serratos) just found out that her boyfriend is cheating on her. Dre (Ross) just found out that he will be able to graduate high school and finally has found a way out of gang life. Kevin (Trautmann) wants nothing more then to join a gang. When him and Dre get into an argument that ends up in carjacking the car that belongs to Carley with Lena has a passenger. The best way to describe this is "Crash" with teens. Total strangers who are all connected by one event that threatens to ruin all of them. This is very moving, powerful and intense. I highly recommend this one but much like "Crash" it's not really one you can watch over and over. The acting is great and the movie is a mix of flashbacks and current events that really make you feel connected to the characters and find your self sad and angry all at once. Overall, a surprisingly good movie that deserves to be watched. I give it a B+","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3184,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

In fact, it seems every movie Paris Hilton stars in ends up being a horrible mess, and this is no exception. The Hottie and the Nottie...let's just think about what a stupid and conceited title that is. When Paris Hilton was offered the role as "The Hottie" she should have turned it down, not just because the script felt like it was written by a 10 year old, but because she is playing "The Hottie". That sounds so conceited, especially since Paris Hilton isn't all she seems to think she is. The title is also stupid, and sounds about as mature as the actual script is, which is the maturity you might find in an elementary school bathroom.\n\nNate Cooper (Joel Moore, who seems to be a mixture of John Heder and Mike White) is dumped by his girlfriend and decides to go to Los Angeles to find and date Christabelle Abbot (Paris Hilton), the girl he was attracted to in the first grade. Christabelle is apparently so attractive that every time she goes jogging, all males stop their activities to stare at her mouth agape. He ends up becoming friends again with her, but she can't go out with him because she made a pact with her not so attractive best friend June Phigg (Christina Lakin). Nate tries to set up guys with June to get with Christabelle. As June begins to get procedures done to her to make her less ugly, Nate begins to become more attracted to her.\n\nI believe earlier I said that June Phigg was not so attractive. Well that's an understatement. The make-up people made the normally attractive Christina Lakin as nasty looking as possible, with black and green teeth stubs, a balding head, and a terrible case of halitosis. Several times I had to turn away from the screen when they would base the humor around June's hideousness, because I felt like I was going to throw up.\n\nThe script is bad, unfunny, and along with that shows no development in character whatsoever. Nate begins to fall for June, but not until after she becomes pretty. Before that, he shows no interest in her at all. He didn't even like her personality, he cares simply about looks, so if any of the female characters were like him, they would be running for the hills from this doofy looking guy. In a romantic comedy (I guess you can call this that, despite the lack of romance or humor), you'd expect there to be someone looking for their true love, but not here. It's all about looks in this superficial waste of time. Also Nate is always lying to make himself seem hipper, and ends up seeming like an unfunny version of Seinfeld's George Costanza, mixed with a lobotomized Napolean Dynamite. The plot also makes little sense. This guy had a crush on this girl in the first grade, then moved. Who the heck keeps a crush on a girl he only knew for less than a year, that barely even knew him. He thinks back to his time in elementary school and really wants to see her...she was a little girl. It's almost pedophilic.\n\nThe acting is all around bad. Joel Moore is by far the best actor, and he doesn't even deserve to play extras in community theater. Paris Hilton has an annoying flirtatious delivery of each line, and I don't think that she was told to act this way, this is just her natural acting abilities. Christina Lakin also has very poor acting abilities, but also didn't really need any. Her role is to be there and look as nasty as possible, then later to look pretty. She has few lines in comparison to the two untalented leads, especially Joel who spouts out stupid lines every 2 seconds. The back-up cast is also terrible, including one guy, who plays Nate's stupid friend, who thinks he is so cool, he's credited as The Greg Wilson, after all it's super cool to put a "The" in front of your name.\n\nI watched this movie, because I thought it might be one of those "So bad it's funny" experiences that you enjoy laughing about later with friends. This is not one of those movies. It's just bad, no wait, it's just terrible. The movie's sense of the humor is so bad, it actually almost made me feel sorry for the writer. If she thought what she was writing was good at all, then she is either completely delusional, or she might have a mental problem. I hope Heidi Ferrer, writer of this film, along with a few episodes of Dawson's Creek, will write a masterpiece and just leave this as a blemish on her booming career, but in the future not force contrived slop on the viewing public with any more screenplays like this.\n\nNow, onto the positives. The camera direction wasn't bad. It was kind of flashy and nice looking at times. The beach this was shot at looked like it would be nice to go for a dip at. I guess that counts as a positive. Paris Hilton plays a terrible character, but at least she's a kind hearted one. And that's all I can think of.\n\nIf you can't tell, I hated this movie with a passion, and from it's current ranking of number 10 in the bottom 100, I can tell other people share my views on this cinematic massacre.\n\nMy rating: BOMB out of ****. 88 mins. PG-13 for language, and crude humor.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36281,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":1.9},"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The back-up cast is also terrible, including one guy, who plays Nate's stupid friend, who thinks he is so cool, he's credited as The Greg Wilson, after all it's super cool to put a "The" in front of your name.\n\nI watched this movie, because I thought it might be one of those "So bad it's funny" experiences that you enjoy laughing about later with friends. This is not one of those movies. It's just bad, no wait, it's just terrible. The movie's sense of the humor is so bad, it actually almost made me feel sorry for the writer. If she thought what she was writing was good at all, then she is either completely delusional, or she might have a mental problem. I hope Heidi Ferrer, writer of this film, along with a few episodes of Dawson's Creek, will write a masterpiece and just leave this as a blemish on her booming career, but in the future not force contrived slop on the viewing public with any more screenplays like this.\n\nNow, onto the positives. The camera direction wasn't bad. It was kind of flashy and nice looking at times. The beach this was shot at looked like it would be nice to go for a dip at. I guess that counts as a positive. Paris Hilton plays a terrible character, but at least she's a kind hearted one. And that's all I can think of.\n\nIf you can't tell, I hated this movie with a passion, and from it's current ranking of number 10 in the bottom 100, I can tell other people share my views on this cinematic massacre.\n\nMy rating: BOMB out of ****. 88 mins. PG-13 for language, and crude humor.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36281,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":1.9,"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

You don't need me or anyone else to tell you that this film is indeed a bit of light-hearted fun that most people can enjoy but what struck me was that more popular 'fun' films such as Snakes on a Plane and Pirates of the Caribbean didn't do as much for me as S.W.A.T. did and this makes me think that S.W.A.T. is a tad underrated, albeit as a popcorn fest.\n\nThe films spends enough time early on hanging around the main character of Jim Street; a disgraced ex-S.W.A.T. member whose partner got them both into a little trouble a few years ago when he made a bit of a botch of a hostage situation. Although Street is played by Colin Farrell whose one of those actors most people have a love/hate relationship with (although it's probably mostly females who fit into the 'love' category) so it's always going to be a little tricky to associate with the fact Farrell is the focus of the film, character wise.\n\nOne scrap of 'cred.' the film has is its inclusion of Samuel L. Jackson as the boss of a newly formed S.W.A.T. team following his return to the force although he gets his own way far too easily during the forming of the team, in my opinion. His search takes control after the good opening and what was effective was that genuinely funny humour as well as decent action/chase scenes are both blended in to the search. We're also introduced to the dangers of law enforcement as Michelle Rodriguez's character tells us when she exclaims she was attacked by a guy three times her size and weight wielding several small sharp razor blades.\n\nWhat makes S.W.A.T. the piece of fun, colloquial film-making it is; is its evidence of light heartedness all the way through. In the UK where I come from, the film was rated as a '12A' which means twelve year olds can see it; as long as there's a parent/guardian with them. The reason for this is its lack of violence and genuine, gritty police action. The chase and action scenes, although impressive, are done in a routine manner with fast talking, joke-style dialogue there to extinguish any threat of profanity or violence for the kids. Also, the music is a cause for concern. I have no idea of the bands nor the songs actually used but it's of that modern day rock/pop stuff that sounds so much like the previous song released in that genre, it's worrying. These songs that pop up at various intervals include montage sequences and the like, keeping the light hearted atmosphere and again, giving the kids something to relate to in the form of music. For me and probably anyone else over the age of 20, it was very disappointing.\n\nThe fact the villain of the film is French is awkward enough. I say French but really, he's European and him and his non-American cronies are another disappointing aspect of the film. It's just too typical of an American summer film to do this: including a Eurotrash villain. The fact he actually spends most of the film in custody and has to issue his threats to press camera crews is another thing that detracts from the film. The fact he's in custody and out of harms way as far as violence and challenging the heroes is concerned; means less of a threat to the kids thanks to the 12A tag. With other odd things cropping up such as the fact each gang just happens to try and rescue the baddie at the exact same time with no prior arrangement of a truce as they all strive for the reward money, was a sloppy piece of film-making.\n\nDespite the good things S.W.A.T. has going for it, it never gets out of that, 'family' gear that it gets into and as a result, feels like a re-hash of that 1986 film Top Gun, only with guns and on the ground instead of jets and in the air. Still, at least you get to hear a couple of Jackson nods to his appearances in Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown, respectively. That in itself, to some, is more than enough of a reason to give S.W.A.T. a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140710,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

He's an unwilling action hero that one can both identify with and admire. His story is gripping and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately some of Chappie's brilliance comes at the expense of the world around him. Plot holes and logical fallacies abound, and although some of it can be written off to the imperfection of humanity (a central theme in the movie) there are enough "Wait, why the would he/she/they do X."" moments to be a significant distraction.\n\nMany reviewers have complained that Chappie Cliché. In an era where the majority of box office darlings with &gt;8 star reviews are remakes, reboots or result of the Disney/Pixar/Marvel equation the majority of those reviewers are clearly either hypocrites or they don't know what cliché means. Chappie is soaked in the Blomkamp style and while that style was new and fresh with District 9, its unreasonable to expect a director's primary product to be novelty.\n\nOverall it's a good movie, certainly more interesting than most of the box-office-safe fare out that's been out there.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":234793,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Like any child, Chappie will come under the influence of his surroundings - some good, some bad - and he will rely on his heart and soul to find his way in the world and become his own man. But there's one thing that makes Chappie different from anyone else: he is a robot. The first robot with the ability to think and feel for himself. His life, his story, will change the way the world looks at robots and humans forever.","datePublished":"2015-03-06","description":"In the near future, crime is patrolled by a mechanized police force.

He's an unwilling action hero that one can both identify with and admire. His story is gripping and will keep you on the edge of your seat. Unfortunately some of Chappie's brilliance comes at the expense of the world around him. Plot holes and logical fallacies abound, and although some of it can be written off to the imperfection of humanity (a central theme in the movie) there are enough "Wait, why the would he/she/they do X."" moments to be a significant distraction.\n\nMany reviewers have complained that Chappie Cliché. In an era where the majority of box office darlings with &gt;8 star reviews are remakes, reboots or result of the Disney/Pixar/Marvel equation the majority of those reviewers are clearly either hypocrites or they don't know what cliché means. Chappie is soaked in the Blomkamp style and while that style was new and fresh with District 9, its unreasonable to expect a director's primary product to be novelty.\n\nOverall it's a good movie, certainly more interesting than most of the box-office-safe fare out that's been out there.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":234793,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Devastated by the loss of his wife Sam and son Jonah leaves Chicago and moves all the way to Seattle with the hopes of moving on and beginning a new life. 18 months down the line Sam is still mourning the loss of Maggie and is unable to function an inch beyond her memories. Young Jonah who is smart for his age understands his fathers' grief and wishes only to see him happy.

The whole thing is a constructed showcase for Will Smith's son. Jaden Smith is not a very good actor and is not believable in the role at all.\n\nThere was no need to make this movie. It offers little in the way of entertainment.\n\nDo yourself a favour and go see toy story 3 instead..the a-team..i think shrek 4 is still playing.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":166947,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"duration":"PT2H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

She's also not interesting and the "action scenes" with her are like the A-team or mcgyver. just amateurish. (just like the black screened beeping Hollywood computers they use, with awful animations.) Then there is the wife and kids and it's just too sweet. The "designated survivor" thing is a very interesting story. I wish there were flash back episodes, why the attackers did it. How was the situation before? Also make Keifer suck. Let him make wrong decisions, be a lousy husband that secretly enjoys all this new power.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80830,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

Luhrmann did an excellent job of making the movie believable while using the quaint language. This movie\n\nbrings new life into the words of Shakespeare, and even if you know the play\n\nalmost by heart it is refreshing to hear the words in an entirely new context, and one which makes sense. This version of Romeo and Juliet actually does add\n\nsomething to the extensive history of the play. The soundtrack is excellent, the acting is appropriate (Danes and DiCaprio do a wonderful job of portraying the young lovers), and the scenery is fabulous. This film jump-started the trend of modern-day Shakespeare remakes, and I think it's the best one."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":215726,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Admittedly, I first watched this movie when it came out\n\nbecause of Leo; eight years later (and seven years after middle school ended), I realize just how well-done this film actually is. Luhrmann did an excellent job of making the movie believable while using the quaint language. This movie\n\nbrings new life into the words of Shakespeare, and even if you know the play\n\nalmost by heart it is refreshing to hear the words in an entirely new context, and one which makes sense. This version of Romeo and Juliet actually does add\n\nsomething to the extensive history of the play. The soundtrack is excellent, the acting is appropriate (Danes and DiCaprio do a wonderful job of portraying the young lovers), and the scenery is fabulous. This film jump-started the trend of modern-day Shakespeare remakes, and I think it's the best one.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":215726,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="

As it is, it's a good film -- at times even a very good film -- and that's certainly no small achievement.\n\nDirector Ed Zwick, of course, is no David Lean -- though "Glory" and "Courage Under Fire" are excellent films ("Legends of the Fall" is decent, while I consider "Leaving Normal" one of the most mundane films ever made).   Here Zwick has attempted a traditional epic, and as with "Courage Under Fire", depicts the horrors of war through a story of personal redemption.  Into this basic story he also injects themes of honor, pride, cultural clashes and technological change versus ancient tradition.\n\nUnfortunately, though, no matter how lofty the ambitions, the bottom line here is that in order to transcend the fairly standard hero-goes-on-a-journey-and- undergoes-change plot that we've all seen many times before, something pretty new and special has to be added.  It's a little late to rehash the old "Searchers"/ "Emerald Forest"/"Dances With Wolves" tale of the white man being captured by enemies and siding with his captors -- unless it's aimed primarily at people who have never seen "The Searchers" or "The Emerald Forest" (Arthur Penn realized this thirty years ago, and made the hero and the journey of "Little Big Man" primarily comedic -- one of the main reasons the film works as well as it does).\n\nBut in the post-Altman/Ashby/Penn era -- where nearly all films -- especially action/adventure films -- have returned to the grandiose seriousness of their 1950s counterparts (with little or none of the wit and satire that crept through in the 60s and 70s), it is therefore pretty much expected that we will get the typical grandiose, serious, high-gloss and overlong treatment all the way through, with very little humor.  And that's too bad.  Because a lighter touch could have gone a long way towards getting the audience more involved, and making Cruise's character more likable (indeed, the few humorous lines and scenes he has are among the film's most memorable moments; they humanize his character and endear us to him).\n\nAnd this is one reason "The Last Samurai," despite a bunch of probable Oscars, is going to miss its target of becoming a beloved classic, an action/adventure epic for the ages.  Just as Sam Mendes did with "Road to Perdition," Zwick has tried a little too hard to impress.  By pouring on the big, movie-type moments, he merely reminds us that he's emulating the greatness of classic directors, without ever equaling them.  Zwick -- as I'm sure he will readily admit -- is merely a student of great filmmakers such as Lean or Kurosawa; he will likely never be one himself.  The sensibility just isn't there, the life experience is missing.\n\nCruise, similarly -- despite his talent -- will never be any kind of substitute for a Flynn or a Gable or a Bogart; Cruise is, after all, the kid from "Risky Business" who danced around in his underwear.  The grinning jock with the big nose from "Top Gun."  The goofball pool hustler from "The Color of Money."  The difference between someone like Cruise (or De Niro, or any of today's top stars) and a complex personality such as Stewart or Fonda or Bogart or Gable is simply immeasurable.  The heart and soul of those great actors is somehow missing from most of today's performers.  So by making a film like "The Last Samurai" in an old-fashioned, traditional way, it constantly invites comparison -- to great stars, to great directors, to the great age of studio filmmaking which, like the Samurai, is now gone -- never to return.\n\nThe sad fact is that the great movie-makers are dying off, leaving us with imitators, not originators.  In the last ten years we've lost Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Wilder, Frankenheimer, Fuller.  In the last six months alone we lost John Schlesinger and Elia Kazan.  Is anyone really expecting to see some sort of masterpiece by a T.V. producer/director named Ed Zwick?!\n\nStill, "The Last Samurai" manages to succeed in a number of ways -- mainly in presenting nineteenth-century Japan in a remarkably realistic way, and in its brutal battle scenes, shot in gory "Braveheart"-style by the great cinematographer John Toll.  It is in these terrifying, agonizing moments of sword-versus-rifle battle that Zwick comes closest to emulating his obvious hero, Akira Kurosawa, and manages to comment on the tragedy and insanity of war.\n\nFlashbacks are used unnecessarily to try to enforce Cruise's sense of guilt in participating in the the slaughter of the Indians (so we will understand his desire to defend another endangered species, the Samurai).  As the apparent title character, Ken Watanabe pretty much steals the show as Katsumodo, the sage warrior leader whom Cruise befriends.  A Japanese actress known only as Koyuki plays the heartbreakingly beautiful wife of a Samurai Cruise kills, who Cruise grows close to.  But perhaps most amazing of the Japanese cast is the small boy who plays one of her sons.  Unexpectedly expressive, emotional, and charming, he's the type of face you would expect to see in a film by the great Kurosawa.  Or Lean.  Or Ford.\n\nAll technical aspects, from production and costume design to visual effects, are excellent.  Hans Zimmer's score, incorporating traditional wood flutes and thunderous drums, is at times touching and evocative, at times bombastic and unnecessarily loud.   All in all, "The Last Samurai" is an impressive production. And even if it  misses being the cinematic classic it strives towards, all involved can be proud of their accomplishment.\n\nAnd whatever its faults, it's almost a miracle when a Hollywood studio today turns out something even a fraction this good.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":408782,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"duration":"PT2H34M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As it is, it's a good film -- at times even a very good film -- and that's certainly no small achievement.\n\nDirector Ed Zwick, of course, is no David Lean -- though "Glory" and "Courage Under Fire" are excellent films ("Legends of the Fall" is decent, while I consider "Leaving Normal" one of the most mundane films ever made).   Here Zwick has attempted a traditional epic, and as with "Courage Under Fire", depicts the horrors of war through a story of personal redemption.  Into this basic story he also injects themes of honor, pride, cultural clashes and technological change versus ancient tradition.\n\nUnfortunately, though, no matter how lofty the ambitions, the bottom line here is that in order to transcend the fairly standard hero-goes-on-a-journey-and- undergoes-change plot that we've all seen many times before, something pretty new and special has to be added.  It's a little late to rehash the old "Searchers"/ "Emerald Forest"/"Dances With Wolves" tale of the white man being captured by enemies and siding with his captors -- unless it's aimed primarily at people who have never seen "The Searchers" or "The Emerald Forest" (Arthur Penn realized this thirty years ago, and made the hero and the journey of "Little Big Man" primarily comedic -- one of the main reasons the film works as well as it does).\n\nBut in the post-Altman/Ashby/Penn era -- where nearly all films -- especially action/adventure films -- have returned to the grandiose seriousness of their 1950s counterparts (with little or none of the wit and satire that crept through in the 60s and 70s), it is therefore pretty much expected that we will get the typical grandiose, serious, high-gloss and overlong treatment all the way through, with very little humor.  And that's too bad.  Because a lighter touch could have gone a long way towards getting the audience more involved, and making Cruise's character more likable (indeed, the few humorous lines and scenes he has are among the film's most memorable moments; they humanize his character and endear us to him).\n\nAnd this is one reason "The Last Samurai," despite a bunch of probable Oscars, is going to miss its target of becoming a beloved classic, an action/adventure epic for the ages.  Just as Sam Mendes did with "Road to Perdition," Zwick has tried a little too hard to impress.  By pouring on the big, movie-type moments, he merely reminds us that he's emulating the greatness of classic directors, without ever equaling them.  Zwick -- as I'm sure he will readily admit -- is merely a student of great filmmakers such as Lean or Kurosawa; he will likely never be one himself.  The sensibility just isn't there, the life experience is missing.\n\nCruise, similarly -- despite his talent -- will never be any kind of substitute for a Flynn or a Gable or a Bogart; Cruise is, after all, the kid from "Risky Business" who danced around in his underwear.  The grinning jock with the big nose from "Top Gun."  The goofball pool hustler from "The Color of Money."  The difference between someone like Cruise (or De Niro, or any of today's top stars) and a complex personality such as Stewart or Fonda or Bogart or Gable is simply immeasurable.  The heart and soul of those great actors is somehow missing from most of today's performers.  So by making a film like "The Last Samurai" in an old-fashioned, traditional way, it constantly invites comparison -- to great stars, to great directors, to the great age of studio filmmaking which, like the Samurai, is now gone -- never to return.\n\nThe sad fact is that the great movie-makers are dying off, leaving us with imitators, not originators.  In the last ten years we've lost Fellini, Kurosawa, Kubrick, Wilder, Frankenheimer, Fuller.  In the last six months alone we lost John Schlesinger and Elia Kazan.  Is anyone really expecting to see some sort of masterpiece by a T.V. producer/director named Ed Zwick?!\n\nStill, "The Last Samurai" manages to succeed in a number of ways -- mainly in presenting nineteenth-century Japan in a remarkably realistic way, and in its brutal battle scenes, shot in gory "Braveheart"-style by the great cinematographer John Toll.  It is in these terrifying, agonizing moments of sword-versus-rifle battle that Zwick comes closest to emulating his obvious hero, Akira Kurosawa, and manages to comment on the tragedy and insanity of war.\n\nFlashbacks are used unnecessarily to try to enforce Cruise's sense of guilt in participating in the the slaughter of the Indians (so we will understand his desire to defend another endangered species, the Samurai).  As the apparent title character, Ken Watanabe pretty much steals the show as Katsumodo, the sage warrior leader whom Cruise befriends.  A Japanese actress known only as Koyuki plays the heartbreakingly beautiful wife of a Samurai Cruise kills, who Cruise grows close to.  But perhaps most amazing of the Japanese cast is the small boy who plays one of her sons.  Unexpectedly expressive, emotional, and charming, he's the type of face you would expect to see in a film by the great Kurosawa.  Or Lean.  Or Ford.\n\nAll technical aspects, from production and costume design to visual effects, are excellent.  Hans Zimmer's score, incorporating traditional wood flutes and thunderous drums, is at times touching and evocative, at times bombastic and unnecessarily loud.   All in all, "The Last Samurai" is an impressive production. And even if it  misses being the cinematic classic it strives towards, all involved can be proud of their accomplishment.\n\nAnd whatever its faults, it's almost a miracle when a Hollywood studio today turns out something even a fraction this good.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":408782,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"duration":"PT2H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="
