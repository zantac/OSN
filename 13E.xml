    <desc lang="pl">Kokon: Directed by Leonie Krippendorff. With Lena Urzendowsky, Jella Haase, Lena Klenke, Elina Vildanova. Berlin-Kreuzberg is Nora's microcosm. Nora, the silent observer, is always tagging along: At parties, at school, at the pool, on rooftops and in apartments. Nora drifts around the monotonous housing blocks with her big sister and her friends, witnessing events that seem to cross-fade in the summer light. Girls who want to be slim and pretty, boys who say dumb things to provoke or because they are in love. Ruthless smartphone cameras and fragile teenagers.

It was written and directed by Michal Rosa.\n\nThe movie is set in 1939 in an apartment house in Silesia--an area of Poland close to the German border. The apartment house itself is unusual. It's clearly not far from a city, but it sits in lonely isolation in a field. It's a very upscale place, and most of the people who live in it are middle or upper class. It's not what we in the U.S. would call a tenement, with poor people making ends meet. It's very elegant.\n\nThe plot centers around a journalist from a large city who is sent to the area to track down an elusive bestselling author. This search is more or less just a way to begin the story. When the reporter arrives, his first meeting is with the beautiful Róza, portrayed by Karolina Gruszka. \n\nRóza has many charms, which she openly displays to the reporter, as well as to any other man who joins her. In turn, director Rosa openly displays Gruszka's charms to his audience. We can all see why she's called "The Happiness of the World."\n\nThe movie plot is actually a series of vignettes. Each inhabitant of the apartment building has her or his own story. To a certain extent, the stories intersect, because all of the characters live in the same place. The pivotal figure in all of this is Róza. Karolina Gruszka isn't just another pretty face. She's an extraordinary actor, who is well known in Poland. The movie will rise or fall depending on Gruszka's presence on the screen. She's great, and the film rises accordingly.\n\nWe watched this movie in Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. It will work well on the small screen. The film was shown at the outstanding 2017 Rochester Polish Film Festival. After the film, director Rosa was in attendance for a Q&amp;A session. (He doesn't speak English, but the interpreter who worked with him was superb.) My compliments to the PFF for bringing the director to Rochester.\n\nFor me, the most striking aspect of the Q&amp;A was Mr. Rosa's discussion of magical realism. I believe that everyone in the audience noted magical realism in the movie. Director Rosa says that it isn't magical realism--it's just realism. I'm not sure if he was joking with us when he said that, or whether he actually believes that the type of events he shows us aren't magical at all. You'll have to watch the movie to see what you think about this realism.\n\nP.S. The Happiness of the World has a dismal IMDb rating of 6.3. It's a much, much better movie than that. Again, you'll have to watch the movie and then decide for yourself.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":124,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2016-12-23","keywords":"silesia,bathtub,femme fatale","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0344734/","name":"Karolina Gruszka"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8475166/","name":"Mateusz Lickindorf"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2707614/","name":"Grzegorz Palkowski"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740853/","name":"Michal Rosa"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330220/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0577510/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740853/","name":"Michal Rosa"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

At least it was my impression that it was a bit slapstick in part, and through some parts I did get bored. However, it did become strong towards the end, in the tragic part.

When Colin learns that his best friend Chick, a fellow acolyte of the philosopher Jean-Sol Partre, has a new American girlfriend, our lonely hero attends a friend's party in hopes of falling in love himself.

The film indeed manages to translate this feeling into visual images, but I felt that it was too much, and while with the book I never felt it tried to be funny, the film did. At least it was my impression that it was a bit slapstick in part, and through some parts I did get bored. However, it did become strong towards the end, in the tragic part. Suddenly the absurdity and weirdness became a proper language for the tragic development, it became a mirror of the protagonists inner world and feelings. It really impressed me there.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15637,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2013-04-24","keywords":"reference to jean paul sartre,water lily,philosophy,absurdism,surrealism","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4269714713","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyOTE1OTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEwMzk4MTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyOTE1OTk4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODEwMzk4MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in a charmingly surreal Paris, wealthy bachelor Colin spends his time developing his pianocktail (a cocktail-making piano) and devouring otherworldly dishes prepared by his trusty chef Nicolas.

So I was really interested to see the film and I decided to visit the WGA screening.\n\nNow let me begin by saying, Meryl Streep embodies Margaret Thatcher. She doesn't just look like her, but she talks like her, her facial expressions are spot on. Meryl Streep becomes Margaret Thatcher. I would be shocked if she doesn't win an Oscar for this performance. The supporting cast is good too, Jim Broadbent gives an excellent performance, everyone is just great.\n\nHowever aside from the top notch acting, the movie had a few flaws. The story was uninteresting at times, the flashback scenes were a bit muddled and a little confusing. The movie felt a little too safe, it tried too hard, not to be controversial. Although I don't entirely blame the film itself for that. Margaret Thatcher was such a decisive person, that whichever side the film picked, it would be criticized by a lot of people. I guess the film ultimately achieved the goal.\n\nI also liked the movie didn't dwell too much on the politics, but on the character of Margaret Thatcher. We see the human side of The Iron Lady herself, beyond all the partisan politics and rumors, we get to see a very personal and sad side of her. The subplot focusing on Thacther's grief over her husband's death, as the older version battles with hallucinations and an unwillingness to let go of her dear Denis are heartbreaking.\n\nOverall the movie was really well done, but just shy of greatness. Meryl Streep's performance and the supporting cast, truly elevates the film into a great biopic. Although I wished a little more time was spent on focusing on her political life, the movie successfully showed a deep and moving side of the prime minister. Which a lot of biopics fail to do.

And I highly respect Phyllida LLoyd, Meryl Streep, Abi Morgan and others for trying to portray such a decisive and highly controversial figure.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106150,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-01-06","keywords":"10 downing street london,old woman,old age,british conservative party,british female politician","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1047305753","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMDYwNzc1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg3OTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMDYwNzc1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTg3OTcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A look at the life of Margaret Thatcher, the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, with a focus on the price she paid for power.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000658/","name":"Meryl Streep","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000980/","name":"Jim Broadbent","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001290/","name":"Richard E.

Diane's kidnapper Barney (Jeff Bridges) has his own interest piqued by Jeff.\n\nThere still persists the perception that remakes are inferior to originals and that European cinema is artistically superior to Hollywood. This movie is used to illustrate those points. But these are far from the only reasons it flopped.\n\nThe casting didn't follow the traditional route. It does not impact the quality of the production and should not be counted as negative. But it deflated the commercial appeal by ignoring the superficial tastes of moviegoers.\n\nKiefer Sutherland is an actor audiences more readily accept as a darker character than victimized nice guy Jeff. This is well-evidenced by his critical triumph in the movie 'Freeway' three years later as a kidnapper/murderer. \n\nAt the time he was also mostly seen bolstering ensemble casts rather than as a conventional male lead. His strong performance should have been enough to carry the film and it would have been had there not been other factors.\n\nJeff Bridges was more readily accepted by audiences as a nice guy male lead. He wanted to play a creep for a change and did an impeccable job here. But audiences had to look past over 20 years of typecasting to accept him in the role and most couldn't. As a result one of the finest characterizations in his long, distinguished career is overlooked.\n\nNo actress could have given a more convincing performance than Nancy Travis in the role of Rita, the heroine. But audiences liked Sandra Bullock better and have always wanted to see more of her which in this case would have meant giving her the more substantial role of Rita than the tragic role of kidnapped Diane.\n\nAt the time (1991-92 pre-production) how could anyone know that Sandra Bullock would soon top the box office like few actresses before her? Nancy Travis had been in a string of hits but then little-known Bullock would surpass her as a star within 18 months of the release of this film. Had they known, there can be little doubt Bullock would have played Rita.\n\nThe ultimate sin that North American film audiences could not forgive is obvious pandering to their own glaring superficial tastes when it comes to how movies end. The 1988 original European version haunted audiences and made them think because of its dark conclusion. That version didn't have a Hollywood ending and that was its payoff - one meant for an entirely different audience.\n\nThe Hollywood version not only wraps up the conflict between the characters differently (rewarding perseverance over intellect, good over evil in typical Hollywood tradition), it also includes a tacked-on, whimsical denouement. North American film audiences DO prefer happy endings with neat and tidy closure.\n\nBut expecting them to embrace the glaring implication that they can't handle scary and/or thought-provoking material is an unforgivable insult which could only elicit the kind of derision from reviewers that it has even though the action which leads up to it is far from boring or silly. Had the film been an original with a facile and obtuse resolution it would have been accepted if not embraced.\n\nHollywood studios obviously have final approval on the cut released to theatres in most instances. A trick some auteurs can employ when attempting to keep the integrity of a darker-themed film is to wait until the deadline before delivering the finished product and including two endings. One ending will be the darker one they want. The other will be the happy ending - one shot and cut so badly that the studio will presumably have to go with the darker ending. This ploy might work if studios cared more about the quality of what they were releasing rather than its box office p potential.\n\nThen there is the release date - February, 1993. What happens in February in Western Culture every year? Valentine's Day! Does this look like a date movie to you? Everything about how this movie was made and marketed invited flop status.\n\nAs I said the action which leads up to the finale is far from boring or silly. In fact much of it is quite watchable and on par with (and in many cases identical to) the original. Where it actually improves upon the original is in its addition of a female lead.\n\nRita is much more interesting than Lieneke - the second girlfriend character in the original an incidental character compared with Rita. Affable, considerate, blessed with work ethic and self-deprecating modesty truck-stop waitress Rita is an unlikely heroine for a Hollywood film.\n\nIndeed truck-stop waitress is an occupation designed for comic relief or passive anonymity in most Hollywood cinema. A female lead can usually portray one only if her character arc ends in her being beneficiary of an extreme reversal of fortune i.e. marrying a rich dude or becoming a supermodel.\n\nRita doesn't entertain herself with such fantasies but she does have aspirations. When Jeff walks in she remembers him from high school but he doesn't remember her. He pulls out a picture of Diane and asks if she has seen her. Rita says that her mind blots out most of the faces she sees. Yet she remembers him. This is a character that knows what she wants as unromantic as it may seem. \n\nThis isn't what North Americans look for in movie heroines if you go by box office and surveys. They may live their lives differently and they even may be happy. But they go to movies to see something else."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24359,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1993-02-05","keywords":"kidnapping,obsession,missing person,buried alive,remake by original director","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Vanishing","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi805044505","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWQzZTExZTctOGY5OS00NWRiLWFjZTItMGE5ODU1ZjNjNDlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWQzZTExZTctOGY5OS00NWRiLWFjZTItMGE5ODU1ZjNjNDlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000313/","name":"Jeff Bridges"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000662/","name":"Kiefer Sutherland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001802/","name":"Nancy Travis"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0806293/","name":"George Sluizer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0469104/","name":"Tim Krabbé"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0333804/","name":"Todd Graff"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His red Caddy convertible with the steer horn on the grille and his florid outfits signal an out-sized noir character channeling Matthew McConaughey from Killer Joe with a touch of Orson Welles' evil south of the border. A serious pig farmer, Jim Bob is hilarious as the swashbuckling, cheesy hunter. But make no mistake—he can give physically as good as he gets with some impressive sleuth work to boot. \n\nThe center of the darkness is Richard, a seemingly solid citizen who has the ambiguous demons usually reserved for the noir hero (think of Bogey's characters). His strong revulsion at the murder passes into something less than that but more than just vigilantism. Anyway, the blood bath at the end is worth seeing for its noir excess and dark humor. \n\nVery few characters in this delightful summer indie get out unscathed, and some indeed find July very cold."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35063,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-12-31","keywords":"based on novel,neo noir,blood,blood splatter,gun","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2715987225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyODM3ODM5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY4ODI2MTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyODM3ODM5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY4ODI2MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"While investigating noises in his house one balmy Texas night in 1989, Richard Dane puts a bullet in the brain of a low-life burglar, Freddy Russell.

His red Caddy convertible with the steer horn on the grille and his florid outfits signal an out-sized noir character channeling Matthew McConaughey from Killer Joe with a touch of Orson Welles' evil south of the border. A serious pig farmer, Jim Bob is hilarious as the swashbuckling, cheesy hunter. But make no mistake—he can give physically as good as he gets with some impressive sleuth work to boot. \n\nThe center of the darkness is Richard, a seemingly solid citizen who has the ambiguous demons usually reserved for the noir hero (think of Bogey's characters). His strong revulsion at the murder passes into something less than that but more than just vigilantism. Anyway, the blood bath at the end is worth seeing for its noir excess and dark humor. \n\nVery few characters in this delightful summer indie get out unscathed, and some indeed find July very cold.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35063,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-12-31","keywords":"based on novel,neo noir,blood,blood splatter,gun","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2715987225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyODM3ODM5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY4ODI2MTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyODM3ODM5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjY4ODI2MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"While investigating noises in his house one balmy Texas night in 1989, Richard Dane puts a bullet in the brain of a low-life burglar, Freddy Russell.

But never mind that I couldn't be sure if some of the courtroom goings-on were kosher ... one move will make you ask yourself if you have ever seen it before ... there was enough going on in the rest of the plot, you needed a score card.

Despite having made an impact as Julia Roberts's implacable husband in Sleeping With the Enemy, in these detective stories with Bergin as the hero he is quiet and reasonable, qualities I told Mike Connors whom I once spied in a restaurant and who had played TV's Mannix years ago were admirable in his character. Yes, Connors said, they don't write 'em that way anymore. I guess Hawaii 5-0's Jack Lord, The Fugitive's David Janssen and Peter Gunn's Craig Stevens to name a few filled that sort of bill and are much to have been appreciated.\n\nCause of Death was made in the early 2000's probably before 9-11 but it has a bit of the feel of the 80's, although I was surprised in a way to see SUV's, laptops and cell phones so much in use; the budget was pretty good on this one, also witness the quality of the direction and the production values, not to mention the script. Re the 80's though. some skirts seemed too short for professional situations; I know I'm not alone in wondering about this because at least one other reviewer here mentioned that. At least the bodices weren't low-cut and sleeveless, even sometimes strappy, as we are supposed to believe by the various CSI's forensic technicians are allowed to sport.\n\nIn this one, Bergin is an assistant state's attorney with a scandal in his recent past who is trying to parse out the high-profile murder of the mayor's somewhat shady cousin. The victim's wife is the accused. Boy, I got a lesson from Joan Severance in how to wrap a man such as Taylor Lewis, played by Bergin, around your little finger. Of course, it helps when you're as beautiful as she is. Somehow I felt Joan was an actress from the distant past and so looked amazing as a 35-year-old. But it's probably just her somewhat dated name. Classic names are making a comeback anyway. And she has cheekbones.\n\nOne thing I kind of liked is that we never meet the mayor, who is herself a woman; we don't really need to and I suppose she just would have confused the roster of characters. There are enough others to keep you busy, including a lovely black man unaccountably named Carmine DeLuca; perhaps he's in witness protection except that rather than give him a white bread name they decided to hide him in plain sight with a moniker no one would expect. Lol. But back to the mayor. Given how things turn out, I almost wish we had met her. There is an interesting subplot in which Bergin and his pretty sidekick this time named Missy have a boss who throws big words all over the place, sometimes wrongly, a bit to Lewis's annoyance. I'm not quite sure why that's in there except possibly to prove that Lewis is, again, more reasoned and intelligent, or give the writer and those of us in the audience who care, who include me, a chance to skewer someone with pompous rhetoric; someone who defames the English language deserves the worst. Ooh, wait, I just did it ... probably shouldn't throw stones. The subplot is not laugh-out-loud funny and it's sort of a red herring and yet it didn't bother me as being out of place.\n\nThis was a very professionally done movie down to the evocation of a smell, that of garbage due to a garbage strike which somehow has to do with the victim buying it. Had there been just a little more finesse with some of the plot points which, truth to tell, were so well laid out their connections almost took care of themselves, this might have been more memorable, and no doubt is a classic in its class. I do not have the same complaint about the end that I had with that other Bergin thriller I have seen so far and am referencing here, Suspicious Minds, in which you did not see the ending coming because you had no clues to point you to it. In Cause of Death I did not see the solution coming but it was a classic one and I was left with the admiring reaction, "Boy, I missed that"; the script must have been doing a great job of redirection. My biggest complaint is that Bergin had another of what seem to be for him obligatory once-a- thriller-in-which-he-is-the-hero sex scenes; he's an imposing mope but I'd sorta rather keep that between him and his future wife.

Being a big fan of his, I didn't want to miss this one. Well, it was the big disappointment of my life. This remake of Bob le Flambeur is horribly directed and acted. The last sequence is just about the best thing of this film, but as for the rest, it was just mediocre, at best.\n\nThe idea of putting together these many characters in the Riviera was probably a great thought, but then, the many actors of different nationalities and backgrounds prove to be a hindrance to the story. If one can get over the accent problem, then there is the sound track of this film, which was so hard to hear at all, at least in the theater where I saw it, that you have a double hurdle to get over.\n\nNick Nolte with his hair dyed a carrot hue looks hideous; he probably was going through a bad period when he made this movie. His take on Bob is fitting with the character's spiral descent into hell because of his drug problem, no doubt. But he is also hard to understand since he whispers and mumbles most of the time. A little more clarity would have helped.\n\n The last moments of the film are very well executed, but as caper films go, this picture doesn't contribute anything to the genre.\n\n Sorry Mr. Jordan, better luck next time out. Maybe leave remakes to mediocre directors. You could not improve in the original one, so why even bother?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10352,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-02-28","keywords":"heist,casino,gambler,monte carlo,voyeur","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Good Thief","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi401801497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0ZTNlZTItNWE5OS00NTZhLWExMzEtNGM2YThlYjBjZjY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0ZTNlZTItNWE5OS00NTZhLWExMzEtNGM2YThlYjBjZjY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000560/","name":"Nick Nolte"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000146/","name":"Ralph Fiennes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0474333/","name":"Nutsa Kukhianidze"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001403/","name":"Neil Jordan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090341/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103900/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494138/","name":"Auguste Le Breton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578483/","name":"Jean-Pierre Melville"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001403/","name":"Neil Jordan"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Being a big fan of his, I didn't want to miss this one. Well, it was the big disappointment of my life. This remake of Bob le Flambeur is horribly directed and acted. The last sequence is just about the best thing of this film, but as for the rest, it was just mediocre, at best.\n\nThe idea of putting together these many characters in the Riviera was probably a great thought, but then, the many actors of different nationalities and backgrounds prove to be a hindrance to the story. If one can get over the accent problem, then there is the sound track of this film, which was so hard to hear at all, at least in the theater where I saw it, that you have a double hurdle to get over.\n\nNick Nolte with his hair dyed a carrot hue looks hideous; he probably was going through a bad period when he made this movie. His take on Bob is fitting with the character's spiral descent into hell because of his drug problem, no doubt. But he is also hard to understand since he whispers and mumbles most of the time. A little more clarity would have helped.\n\n The last moments of the film are very well executed, but as caper films go, this picture doesn't contribute anything to the genre.\n\n Sorry Mr. Jordan, better luck next time out. Maybe leave remakes to mediocre directors. You could not improve in the original one, so why even bother?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10352,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-02-28","keywords":"heist,casino,gambler,monte carlo,voyeur","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Good Thief","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi401801497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0ZTNlZTItNWE5OS00NTZhLWExMzEtNGM2YThlYjBjZjY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0ZTNlZTItNWE5OS00NTZhLWExMzEtNGM2YThlYjBjZjY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000560/","name":"Nick Nolte","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000146/","name":"Ralph Fiennes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0474333/","name":"Nutsa Kukhianidze"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001403/","name":"Neil Jordan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090341/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103900/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494138/","name":"Auguste Le Breton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578483/","name":"Jean-Pierre Melville","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001403/","name":"Neil Jordan"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Overall this film is a misguided attempt at a Hulk film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258875,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2003-06-20","keywords":"radiation,monster,scientist,general,technology","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hulk","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1139409177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQyNGIxMzctM2NkYy00ZWY4LWIwN2MtYzJmNDQ3MDJiNmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTQyNGIxMzctM2NkYy00ZWY4LWIwN2MtYzJmNDQ3MDJiNmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0051509/","name":"Eric Bana","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000124/","name":"Jennifer Connelly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095134/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092570/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498278/","name":"Stan Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456158/","name":"Jack Kirby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"],"duration":"PT2H18M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama.

But those who opposed California becoming a state in the Union are planning a new threat that might change their plans.\n\nThe Mask Of Zorro was a pretty good film. The sequel isn't as good yet it's still enjoyable. I personally would rather have the PG-13 rating but surprisingly the sequel didn't actually suck. I have to give credit to the cast and director. Martin Campbell knows how to direct action and he made this film very entertaining to watch. The story is a little weak and there isn't really anything new to found here but the action makes up for that.\n\nThe acting is solid just like the first one. Antonio Banderas takes the role of Zorro again and he does a good job. Catherine Zeta Jones returns as Elena and she also does a pretty good job. These two have a lot of chemistry together and they are interesting to watch on screen. The new addition to the cast and the person who almost ruined the film is Adrian Alonso. He plays Joaquin, the son of Zorro and Elena. He has a few funny lines but for the most part, he is really annoying. His role should have been cut since he almost ruined the entire movie.\n\nMany people are complaining that the new rating kills the film and I disagree. The fight scenes are tamer and safer when compared to the original. He actually doesn't really use his sword to kill nor is much blood shown. However, the fight scenes are still pretty good and there are a lot of entertaining scenes like the train scene at the end. There were some boring scenes but they didn't last long. Also, the film is really cheesy and some of this does get annoying, nothing too major though. In the end, if you expect something like the original movie than you will end up disappointed. However, if you want something in the vein of National Treasure, a safe family action film, then this sequel is for you and it can really be enjoyed by adults too.

These two have a lot of chemistry together and they are interesting to watch on screen. The new addition to the cast and the person who almost ruined the film is Adrian Alonso. He plays Joaquin, the son of Zorro and Elena. He has a few funny lines but for the most part, he is really annoying. His role should have been cut since he almost ruined the entire movie.\n\nMany people are complaining that the new rating kills the film and I disagree. The fight scenes are tamer and safer when compared to the original. He actually doesn't really use his sword to kill nor is much blood shown. However, the fight scenes are still pretty good and there are a lot of entertaining scenes like the train scene at the end. There were some boring scenes but they didn't last long. Also, the film is really cheesy and some of this does get annoying, nothing too major though. In the end, if you expect something like the original movie than you will end up disappointed. However, if you want something in the vein of National Treasure, a safe family action film, then this sequel is for you and it can really be enjoyed by adults too.

Taking its cue from Shrek Forever After, MIB 3 takes on a tired concept (time travel in this case) if only to acknowledge the failure of its dull sequel and take us back to a different era allowing us to view the franchise from an unsullied angle. The result is a film that returns to its roots and gives audiences the chance to relive much of what they first enjoyed – a smart, sci-fi, buddy comedy that embraces everything weird and wonderful about the unknown universe.\n\nIn his first cinematic role in nearly 4 years, Will Smith's Agent J is the usual charming, witty wiseass we expect him to be. Still teamed up with the laconic Agent K (wrinkly Tommy Lee Jones) he is no closer to cracking his older partners deadpan demeanour but their relationship issues take a back seat when a nemesis from Kay's past, Boris the animal, turns up to exact revenge for having been imprisoned on the moon 40 years ago. His elaborate plan takes him back in the past, to the day he was caught, and sets ripples in the present, where K no longer exists and a different reality results. J has to then literally time jump (off the Empire State building no less) and fix the past for normalcy to return in the present.\n\nDirectly Barry Sonnenfeld seems to find his groove once again with the zany and icky shenanigans that put him on the map with the original. Using plenty of the wide angle camera work that gave him fame as the Coen's favourite lenser, the resulting imagery should work wonders for those who decide to pay extra and catch the film on 3D (converted). Boris the animal is also a return to series villains being screwball and menacing in equal measure (remember Vincent D'Onofrio?) and Rick Baker's excellent makeup effects are both incredible and revolting. The big surprise is how well Josh Brolin impersonates Jones in the role of a younger K – which should not be a surprise considering Brolin's recent, impressive body of work as a bonafide actor, most notably in W. So chameleon-like is his performance that you forget it's him and actually completely believe it's just a younger version of Tommy Lee Jones that you're seeing.\n\nThe films primary achievement and a true signal of its return to form though are the scenes set in the past. Not only is Josh Brolin a deadringer for Tommy Lee's K during his youth, but the hip musical vibes of the late 60's/early 70's allow for plenty of playfulness to ensue with a particularly hilarious segment devoted to Andy Warhol. If that isn't enough, everything very neatly ties into another epochal scientific moment from that time period and ends on a moment of curiously satisfying emotionality that provides not only closure to the film but the series as a whole. If that doesn't make you forgive all the wrongs that the sequel did and embrace this film as one of the years better movie franchise offerings the only thing that might work on you is a neuralizer.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":345621,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2012-05-25","keywords":"escape from prison,neil armstrong character,alien,time travel,cape canaveral florida","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3916407065","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzIzNzE5MjU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ5NTEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzIzNzE5MjU5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjQ5NTEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Agent J time-jumps back to the year 1969 to take out an alien with its sights on the younger version of Agent K -- a situation that poses a threat to the future of the MIB organization, and humankind's very existence."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000982/","name":"Josh Brolin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001756/","name":"Barry Sonnenfeld"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0316575/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0009119/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1000113/","name":"Etan Cohen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192384/","name":"Lowell Cunningham"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama.

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama.

It's an adorable film that is perfect for the whole family. I love this film because of the acting and CGI. \n\nPeter Rabbit follows Peter Rabbit, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton Tail and Benji as they get into mischief by taking vegetables from the garden next door. They take the vegetables from Mr. McGregor who tries desperately to get them out of their garden by using explosives and even an electric fence. The rabbits hang out with loveable characters like Bea. She helps the rabbits by giving them shelter when it rains and helps them get food.\n\nThroughout the movie, we see great acting from all the actors and voice actors in the film. I love how Domhnall Gleeson acts like a soulless man with the rabbits who he is trying to kill, but with Bea, he acts like in he's love. I found that Mr. McGregor (Domhnall Gleeson) really does seem to be in love with Bea. I also like how the voice actors portray the rabbits. Each one of them has a personality that is well portrayed in their voices and actions. For example, Cotton Tail is a memorable character because of how wild and reckless she is. The way Daisy Ridley voices her shows how wild she can be. \n\nThe CGI in this film is extraordinary. The animals look so realistic. If you really focus on the rabbits, you can see the individual hairs on them. You can also see it on the pig character that hangs out with the rabbits. During a fight sequence with Peter and Mr. McGregor, they actually look like they are fighting and not like he is fighting a fake bunny. \n\nI rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 7 to 12. \n\nReviewed by Carla P., KIDS FIRST!

It's an adorable film that is perfect for the whole family. I love this film because of the acting and CGI. \n\nPeter Rabbit follows Peter Rabbit, Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton Tail and Benji as they get into mischief by taking vegetables from the garden next door. They take the vegetables from Mr. McGregor who tries desperately to get them out of their garden by using explosives and even an electric fence. The rabbits hang out with loveable characters like Bea. She helps the rabbits by giving them shelter when it rains and helps them get food.\n\nThroughout the movie, we see great acting from all the actors and voice actors in the film. I love how Domhnall Gleeson acts like a soulless man with the rabbits who he is trying to kill, but with Bea, he acts like in he's love. I found that Mr. McGregor (Domhnall Gleeson) really does seem to be in love with Bea. I also like how the voice actors portray the rabbits. Each one of them has a personality that is well portrayed in their voices and actions. For example, Cotton Tail is a memorable character because of how wild and reckless she is. The way Daisy Ridley voices her shows how wild she can be. \n\nThe CGI in this film is extraordinary. The animals look so realistic. If you really focus on the rabbits, you can see the individual hairs on them. You can also see it on the pig character that hangs out with the rabbits. During a fight sequence with Peter and Mr. McGregor, they actually look like they are fighting and not like he is fighting a fake bunny. \n\nI rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to ages 7 to 12. \n\nReviewed by Carla P., KIDS FIRST!

He is as staunchly loyal to his friends as RDA's version. Granted, he frequently breaks the fourth wall, but that only makes the show more believable (at least, to me). Most of the actual 'macgyverings' too are almost equally surprising and awesome.

I've read the comics (mostly the Ultimate comics, but some of the 60's comics as well), played some of the video games, and watched the cartoons (The 1994 and 2008 series being some of my favorite animated shows of all time).\n\nI enjoyed Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy (yes, even Spider-Man 3). When I heard that the series was being rebooted, I wasn't happy to hear about it. My expectations were neutral as time went by and when I walked out the theater, my expectations were blown away.\n\nI don't want to compare this movie to the original trilogy, but I think it's necessary to see where this movie improved from the originals.\n\nLet's start with the casting. Andrew Garfield is a great successor to Tobey Maguire. I can really relate to him like I always do with other incarnations of the web slinger. Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is even better than Kirsten Dunst as Mary Jane Watson. Gwen is a much stronger character and the chemistry between her and Garfield as Peter Parker is believable. Rhys Ifans is great as Doctor Connors (a.k.a. The Lizard) and I like how he is a "Jekyll and Hyde"-type of villain (kind of like a few other villains... yeah). Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May, respectively, are also great as well. All the characters are portrayed very well and are believable.\n\nThe visual effects and the action scenes are good as usual, but nothing new.\n\nThe musical score by James Horner is also great, although I prefer Danny Elfman's score in the original trilogy because they felt more memorable and left a lasting impression. But, who knows? James Horner's score may grow on me over time.\n\nIf I have to name some complaints, it would have to be that some parts were rushed (although it's a minor nitpick) as well as a couple of parts not evaluated much. I think an extended cut of the movie would be necessary when it's released on DVD, but that's just me.\n\nOverall, "The Amazing Spider-Man" is a fresh new start on the franchise. It has superb acting, thrilling action scenes (especially the climax), an amazing score, and being faithful to the comics but at the same time taking liberties to make it more interesting. Best Spidey movie ever? It's too early to tell but maybe. It's definitely worth watching and I am looking forward to the sequel."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":579984,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2012-07-05","keywords":"death of parents,teenage protagonist,aunt nephew relationship,spider man character,spider","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi717595161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NTM2ODkzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjY3NTE4Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the four-minute trailer for The Amazing-Spider Man."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1940449/","name":"Andrew Garfield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0406975/","name":"Rhys Ifans"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1989536/","name":"Marc Webb"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095403/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0888743/","name":"James Vanderbilt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0765091/","name":"Alvin Sargent"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460141/","name":"Steve Kloves"}],"duration":"PT2H16M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama. I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this.

It is one of the most-engaging legal mini-series ever produced. Reminiscent of the intensity of the 1960s series The Defenders.\n\nA lawyer is sent to a small Canadian town to resolve claims a client's drug might be causing local girls to get sick. That starts her on a quest to find the cause of the illness. \n\nGreat script and top-notch acting by Kristin Kreuk and Peter Mooney in the lead roles.\n\nIntrigue. Romance. Danger. Sleazy lawyers. Corrupt police and politicians. Family feuding and secrets.

It is one of the most-engaging legal mini-series ever produced. Reminiscent of the intensity of the 1960s series The Defenders.\n\nA lawyer is sent to a small Canadian town to resolve claims a client's drug might be causing local girls to get sick. That starts her on a quest to find the cause of the illness. \n\nGreat script and top-notch acting by Kristin Kreuk and Peter Mooney in the lead roles.\n\nIntrigue. Romance. Danger. Sleazy lawyers. Corrupt police and politicians. Family feuding and secrets.

Every once in a while, particularly during summer months when studios are rolling out their blockbuster hopefuls, you'll see a couple of movies released that seem to be mirror images of one-another. Not exactly the same, but similar enough that it seems like they must have some common ancestor.\n\nThe reason why this happens is pretty straight forward and has to do with the unusual way the movie industry works. Often, the scripts for movies aren't developed in-house by the studios, but rather purchased from freelance writers who come up with an idea and then "pitch" it to multiple studios looking for a buyer.\n\nThe process works for both the writers and the studios. There is a catch, however, which is that the person pitching relies upon a studio honoring an informal agreement not to use an idea without compensating the creator. The problem is that less scrupulous studio executives will have no problem passing on an idea and then blatantly copying it for their own movie. And even though everyone involved knows what's happening, it's pretty rare for anyone to actually sue over it, so it tends to keep happening.\n\nA famous example of this (famous in the relative sense) happened with the movies 'Deep Impact' and 'Armageddon'. The original author who pitched 'Deep Impact' watched a studio exec take copious notes during the pitch, pass on it, and then rush to create a script and get his ripped off version made in time to compete with 'Deep Impact', which was purchased by another studio.\n\nThis usually happens when someone creates a script that captures the zeitgeist; that taps into an idea that just clicks with what people are talking and thinking about and it becomes the "must have" idea of the year.\n\nUnless you're an industry insider, it can be difficult to know which movie was the original concept and which was the ripoff, but generally the original idea will be more polished and well thought out. 'Armageddon', for example, famously had such huge plot holes that the cast was complaining about them during filming.\n\n'Olympus Has Fallen' (OHF) came out around the same time as 'White House Down' (WHD). Both movies feature an attack on the white house with an invading force, aided by a turncoat secret service agent, conquering the presidential security in an attempt to take him hostage. Both movies also have a protagonist who isn't secret service, but has some connection to the agency and ultimately proves that he deserves to be guarding the president. Both movies involve protecting a child caught in the crossfire. Both have failed attempts by special forces to re-take the building. Both involve explosions that destroy the building. Both movies involve forcing a change to foreign policy. And so on, you get the idea.\n\nI don't know which was the original, but I have a guess. The movies were made during the presidency of Barack Obama. After he was elected, there was a lot of speculation about whether he would be the subject of an assassination attempt. To African Americans Obama represented an almost unbelievable event: one of their own elected to the most powerful office in the nation. And there was a great deal of angst about losing him violently, the way a number of prominent black leaders had been lost in the past. I think that was the kernel that sparked the original screenplay; this clash of the old power base and the new one in the symbolic seat of national power.\n\nTo my mind, WHD was the liberal take on the idea while OHF was the conservative counter. WHD featured a charismatic black president clearly modeled after Obama, right down to his attempts to quit smoking. The villains are white supremacist types backed by the old-guard military industrial complex who are fearful of the changes the president was making to foreign policy. And the protagonist is a millennial trying to prove he was worthy of the responsibility of protecting the president, perhaps an analogy for the young political activists that brought new methods of campaigning to Obama's election.\n\nOHF, by contrast, features a white male president with villains who were almost exclusively Asian, and rather than representing the supporters of the status quo they are actively looking to tear down American force abroad, suggesting that the bad guys can't stand how effective the traditional American foreign policy is. In other words, the message is "we are winning and they are getting desperate". Even the protagonist is more representative of the target audience: a middle-aged man with a penchant for defiantly vowing to destroy the villains and defend our way of life.\n\nNeither movie is particularly deep; it's mostly about the action sequences. In other words, these are popcorn movies. But I do think it's interesting how two such similar base ideas can manifest such different messages. While WHD is about the (then) rising tide of the progressive political movement and the supposed fear within groups that traditionally held power in the US, OHF is all about the traditional conservative message of Jingoism and the need to protect ourselves from the parts of the world that don't share our values.\n\nWhatever the case may be, OHF was successful enough to green light a second film 'London Has Fallen', which is a continuation of the themes, only with (primarily) middle-eastern villains instead of Asian ones, and an upcoming 'Angel Has Fallen'. Personally, I thought OHF was decent but unspectacular. I enjoyed it enough when I saw it on HBO or Netflix or wherever, but I probably wouldn't pay to see it in the theater.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-03-22","keywords":"politics,political thriller,u.s. president,political assassination,white house","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exclusive Debut","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3461588761","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2NDc5NzgyN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODc0MzQzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Disgraced former Presidential guard Mike Banning finds himself trapped inside the White House in the wake of a terrorist attack; using his inside knowledge, Banning works with national security to rescue the President from his kidnappers."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001173/","name":"Aaron Eckhart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002572/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332840/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4950667/","name":"Creighton Rothenberger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4951717/","name":"Katrin Benedikt"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To name a few: they were not smart with the windows. You can see cameramen in the cabin windows toward the end of the scene in the cabin. There are also LOTS of missed opportunities - one being that the good guy leaves a rifle with the bad guy after fighting with him.

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something.

I sure hope Netflix offers us the 2nd season, and more!!!!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1479,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime"],"datePublished":"2017-10-25","keywords":"technology","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9426329/","name":"Viet Anh Do","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2203849/","name":"Marta Nieradkiewicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0867603/","name":"Bartlomiej Topa"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0668353/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0506795/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0185099/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0922388/","name":"Wendy West"]&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

First of all, autism is on a spectrum. Everybody who has autism experiences it differently and acts differently. Second of all, there's no need to bring politics into this. I don't see how this program is leftist at all. There are no politicians in it, no controversial methods dealing with abortion etc, nothing about the LGBT or race or feminism. Nothing in this show is about politics so I don't see how it's leftist. Anyway, thirdly and lastly, please learn grammar first before trashing something. There's a difference between "your" and "you're".\n\nSomeone also said that disabled people shouldn't be shown as "superheroes". That is an insult to all amazing disabled people such as Hellen Keller and Stephen Hawking. The people who trashed this show are probably neurotypicals with no sympathy for those with setbacks, whether mental or physical.\n\nEND OF RANT\n\nNow, I should stop my ranting and actually talk about the show. Shaun Murphy is a doctor with autism and savant syndrome. People with savant syndrome may have low IQ scores but can be "savants" or talented at something such as art, calculations, memory, etc. Shaun has an excellent memory which aids him when operating on patients. People doubt him at first, but are then amazed when he saves someone's life. This show is probably on par, more on less, with any other medical/hospital/etc show in terms of drama. I'm just glad that there's accurate autism representation on TV and that people with autism are not idiots who can't fend for themselves and need to be pitied and babied over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":75781,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-09-25","keywords":"autism,surgeon,based on tv series,three word series title,san francisco california","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0383603/","name":"Freddie Highmore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004991/","name":"Hill Harper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771493/","name":"Richard Schiff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0483675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0466990/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0794914/","name":"David Shore"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3400122137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE0NzE0ZGItZmI3Ni00NTg5LTg3YjEtYmRiZDkxOThlMTA2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""The Good Doctor" Season 3 premieres September 23 on ABC."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However it never aspires to be anything else preventing it from becoming a classic amongst the genre.\n\nI haven't been familiar with the true story but from the start, you just know where it is all gonna go. It still works well but nothing is a surprise because of that. It still has some great moments and a fair amount of heart\n\nIt is seriously enjoyable and it is a likeable movie with a great cast. Kristen Scott Thomas and Sharon Horgan are great here. I'm sure there are many people who will like this film. I just can't see that much greatness in it. It's formulaic and does it's best to be a lovely and charming film but it does it in such a manipulative way, and I hate it when films do that.

Back then, the politics wasn't perceived as being the result of just one single mad man. It was a huge and, back then, popular organization that was ruling the country. I haven't read the original book; probably it's written the same way, but if it does, then it's, too, not using the words that have been used back then and written from a retrospective. So to me, this flic is rather a fictional wannabe than a realistic biopic.\n\nThough I admit the film was portraying only a child's view on the situation, from my point of view it is emotionally quite vapid. All the important moments in the film that might have caused the slightest suspense or compassion were left out.

I wouldn't call the few dull notes in the movie a "score" anyway. The musical score didn't at all convey any emotion whatsoever.\n\nThe depicted situations all were so nugatory staged and poorly scored, it was often utterly hard to bear. When the family left their mansion at the beginning of the movie I begged for some emotional musical score to convey the loss. But no, why bother viewers with emotion ...\n\nThen, dialogs were often spoken like being read from a text sheet. The intonation was horrible. Important words were hidden in a discharge of words. No pause was disturbing the spate.\n\nThe only exception to the cast was the elder woman playing the housekeeper/nanny. She was acting marvellously, conveying emotions from every word and every micromotion. And I felt the actor depicting the son character acting quite authentic.\n\nFinally, I don't quite unterstand why French scenes were subtitled while the Swiss actors (even the children) were to talk German instead of Swiss German. The children even were dubbed. Well, as I wrote before, the flick was implausible to many regards.\n\nFor everyone who wants to follow a year in a child's live bothered with some relocations but otherwise living a life everyone else lived back then, they will enjoy the movie. But for everyone else, expecting only a fraction of a quality flick like "Der Engel mit der Posaune", they will certainly be disappointed.

I walked in expecting the worst, but the first 20 minutes genuinely gripped me and even made me jump once. As the film continues, it mostly becomes a Dr. Loomis vs. Michael Myers storyline with Omar Epps' frazzled detective trying to make sense of how a seemingly normal teenage male could survive a few gunshots and a fall off a hospital roof and still continue to kill people every Halloween for a number of years. Could it be a copycat killer? You'll have to stick with Trick to find out and, once you do, you'll most likely be let down.\n\nWhile most of the film plays out like a supernatural-tinged slasher, the last 15 minutes of the movie, where the film finally reveals what's really been going on, is likely to inspire many groans and rolling eyes. There's a piece of an interesting idea in there, but it's not as well-executed as it could have been. There's a final twist at the end that's really a groaner and makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nThe acting is at least passable for most of the film and it's nice to see genre icon Tom Atkins getting something to do every now and then. It also might be one of the better of the recent "the corpses in this haunted house are real" movies that seem to be coming out all the time. There's some good suspense here and there, too, so Trick is far from a complete waste of time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4554,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2019-10-18","keywords":"halloween,splatter,slasher,gore,bloody","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1954987801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQ0NGJlMTctNGFmYy00OWI2LTk4YTYtZjBjYmY4ZWMzNmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQ0NGJlMTctNGFmYy00OWI2LTk4YTYtZjBjYmY4ZWMzNmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On Halloween night in 2015, Patrick "Trick" Weaver massacred his classmates at a costume party.

I walked in expecting the worst, but the first 20 minutes genuinely gripped me and even made me jump once. As the film continues, it mostly becomes a Dr. Loomis vs. Michael Myers storyline with Omar Epps' frazzled detective trying to make sense of how a seemingly normal teenage male could survive a few gunshots and a fall off a hospital roof and still continue to kill people every Halloween for a number of years. Could it be a copycat killer? You'll have to stick with Trick to find out and, once you do, you'll most likely be let down.\n\nWhile most of the film plays out like a supernatural-tinged slasher, the last 15 minutes of the movie, where the film finally reveals what's really been going on, is likely to inspire many groans and rolling eyes. There's a piece of an interesting idea in there, but it's not as well-executed as it could have been. There's a final twist at the end that's really a groaner and makes no sense whatsoever.\n\nThe acting is at least passable for most of the film and it's nice to see genre icon Tom Atkins getting something to do every now and then. It also might be one of the better of the recent "the corpses in this haunted house are real" movies that seem to be coming out all the time. There's some good suspense here and there, too, so Trick is far from a complete waste of time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4554,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2019-10-18","keywords":"halloween,splatter,slasher,gore,bloody","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1954987801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQ0NGJlMTctNGFmYy00OWI2LTk4YTYtZjBjYmY4ZWMzNmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGQ0NGJlMTctNGFmYy00OWI2LTk4YTYtZjBjYmY4ZWMzNmQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On Halloween night in 2015, Patrick "Trick" Weaver massacred his classmates at a costume party.

Besides that, it stretches the viewer's ability to empathize with the central character. It tests the viewer's sense of humanity, sense of justice, and his/her levels of tolerance. The viewer is tortured, is made to think beyond his comfortable life, his family, his friends etc. and is forced to think and feel for girls like 'Justine', girls who are forced to forego their self-identities to live under the identity of 'Justine'. Justine symbolizes the millions of innocent girls born free, born to live normal lives but are kidnapped, trafficked, blackmailed and forced into prostitution. Such girls gradually lose the sense of self, lose the sense of identity, sense of being human and begin to believe that they deserve it, that this is what their destiny is, this is what they are made of. How is it justified? Why should such a thing happen to anyone? Is there an escape? Where is hope? Who am I? What am I? If I escape, who will I be? Though the film may not offer answers to these questions, but through the character of Pauline it raises these questions in an effectual manner in the viewer's hearts, making 'Your Name Is Justine' an unforgettable experience.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":473,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pig,slaughterhouse,toasting with a drink,drinking vodka,male female relationship","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1752088/","name":"Anna Cieslak"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295823/","name":"Arno Frisch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533650/","name":"Rafal Mackowiak"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0143581/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121022/","name":"Chris Burdza"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1268993/","name":"Tomasz Kepski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Besides that, it stretches the viewer's ability to empathize with the central character. It tests the viewer's sense of humanity, sense of justice, and his/her levels of tolerance. The viewer is tortured, is made to think beyond his comfortable life, his family, his friends etc. and is forced to think and feel for girls like 'Justine', girls who are forced to forego their self-identities to live under the identity of 'Justine'. Justine symbolizes the millions of innocent girls born free, born to live normal lives but are kidnapped, trafficked, blackmailed and forced into prostitution. Such girls gradually lose the sense of self, lose the sense of identity, sense of being human and begin to believe that they deserve it, that this is what their destiny is, this is what they are made of. How is it justified? Why should such a thing happen to anyone? Is there an escape? Where is hope? Who am I? What am I? If I escape, who will I be? Though the film may not offer answers to these questions, but through the character of Pauline it raises these questions in an effectual manner in the viewer's hearts, making 'Your Name Is Justine' an unforgettable experience.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":473,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pig,slaughterhouse,toasting with a drink,drinking vodka,male female relationship","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1752088/","name":"Anna Cieslak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295823/","name":"Arno Frisch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0533650/","name":"Rafal Mackowiak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0143581/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121022/","name":"Chris Burdza","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1268993/","name":"Tomasz Kepski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0210938/","name":"Franco de Pena"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

 --- Description: Wino truskawkowe: Directed by Dariusz Jablonski. With Jirí Machácek, Zuzana Fialová, Marian Dziedziel, Mieczyslaw Grabka. This is not a love story though it is full of love. It is not a comedy though the characters often say funny things. It is not a detective story even though the hero is trying to solve a murder. It is not a nature drama though it shows the splendid colours and customs of the countryside. It is not a musical though Lubica expresses her longing in a passionate dance. Nor is it a film about ghosts though a ghost does ask the hero for a favour. A few draughts of Strawberry Wine are enough to take us into a magical world in the true centre of Europe, where love, crime and penitence are just as much a part of life as the changing of the seasons, the migration of birds or the flowing of a mountain stream." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1260596/","name":"Wino truskawkowe","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI5MjU4YjUtNGJkNy00Nzk2LTgyYWEtMDk0OTBmY2NmZTYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTgyNDg0NTY@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is not a love story though it is full of love.

Also incorporated into the storyline is the love story of Alfred and his wife. And the strain the picture was putting on it.\n\nI had high hopes for Hitchcock. Alfred Hitchcock may not be my favorite director but he was most defiantly light years ahead of his time and undeniably a genius. On top of that Psycho is one of my favorite films ever made. So far this film was shaping up to be fantastic, it appealed to me in all the right ways, trailer was good, Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock and it was about the making of Psycho. To which, aspiring filmmakers as well as the average movie goer can really appreciate. So why only a 7/10?\n\nWell, the film delved too deeply into the love story, I personally think. The film is very enjoyable and to that aspect of the film, I don't mind as much as you may perceive but withholding that aspect and indulging on the actual making of Psycho could have really benefited this film. It's not the film Hitchcock or Psycho fans will love, it will be a film where you walk out and remark, "that was good," but not a very solid good. And normally I would be inclined to agree with you, but for some reason I still did like this film.\n\nIt contains fantastic acting including Hopkins, albeit certain scenes he may have overacted a tad bit, it's interesting and is enjoyable. In addition it also contains great references albeit not very subtle, the complete opposite of subtle to Psycho and a few other Hitchcock films which work to its advantage in my opinion. I also rather liked the inclusion of Ed Gein and the conversations that took place between him and Hitchcock.\n\nBasically this film will appeal to everyone. But, unfortunately it isn't the film it could have been or should have been, but ultimately it is enjoyable, funny and above all entertaining. If you're a fan of Hitchcock and Psycho though, don't get your hopes up too high.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":73947,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2012-12-14","keywords":"year 1959,1950s,los angeles california,studio executive,censorship board","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2501551129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTgzODM1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzOTk1OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTgzODM1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzOTk1OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A love story between influential filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock and wife Alma Reville during the filming of Psycho in 1959."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000545/","name":"Helen Mirren"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424060/","name":"Scarlett Johansson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0315065/","name":"Sacha Gervasi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199880/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0118469/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572352/","name":"John J.

The relationship between Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma Reville during the filming of Psycho (1960) in 1959 is explored." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0975645/","name":"Hitchcock","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAwNDI5NjIwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjc4ODc2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The relationship between Alfred Hitchcock and his wife Alma Reville during the filming of Psycho (1960) in 1959 is explored.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0975645/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"ChooseyAMovie","dateCreated":"2013-02-08","inLanguage":"English","name":"Keep the Hitch, drop the Cock.","reviewBody":"Hitchcock follows Alfred Hitchcock's strenuous quest to complete a picture to which everyone deemed awful. Also incorporated into the storyline is the love story of Alfred and his wife. And the strain the picture was putting on it.\n\nI had high hopes for Hitchcock. Alfred Hitchcock may not be my favorite director but he was most defiantly light years ahead of his time and undeniably a genius. On top of that Psycho is one of my favorite films ever made. So far this film was shaping up to be fantastic, it appealed to me in all the right ways, trailer was good, Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock and it was about the making of Psycho. To which, aspiring filmmakers as well as the average movie goer can really appreciate. So why only a 7/10?\n\nWell, the film delved too deeply into the love story, I personally think. The film is very enjoyable and to that aspect of the film, I don't mind as much as you may perceive but withholding that aspect and indulging on the actual making of Psycho could have really benefited this film. It's not the film Hitchcock or Psycho fans will love, it will be a film where you walk out and remark, "that was good," but not a very solid good. And normally I would be inclined to agree with you, but for some reason I still did like this film.\n\nIt contains fantastic acting including Hopkins, albeit certain scenes he may have overacted a tad bit, it's interesting and is enjoyable. In addition it also contains great references albeit not very subtle, the complete opposite of subtle to Psycho and a few other Hitchcock films which work to its advantage in my opinion. I also rather liked the inclusion of Ed Gein and the conversations that took place between him and Hitchcock.\n\nBasically this film will appeal to everyone. But, unfortunately it isn't the film it could have been or should have been, but ultimately it is enjoyable, funny and above all entertaining. If you're a fan of Hitchcock and Psycho though, don't get your hopes up too high.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":73947,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2012-12-14","keywords":"year 1959,1950s,los angeles california,studio executive,censorship board","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2501551129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTgzODM1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzOTk1OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTgzODM1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzOTk1OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A love story between influential filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock and wife Alma Reville during the filming of Psycho in 1959.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000545/","name":"Helen Mirren","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424060/","name":"Scarlett Johansson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0315065/","name":"Sacha Gervasi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199880/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0118469/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572352/","name":"John J.

When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential, she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles, she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard - her second collaboration with director and co- writer Zal Batmanglij, The East, is no exception, and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. \n\nThe film follows Jane Owen (Marling), an undercover security agent, as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend (Jason Ritter) to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group known as The East, who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their covered-up crimes against humans and nature. In between reports to her icy, amoral boss (Patricia Clarkson), Jane slowly grows fascinated with the group, its morals and goals, and its core (Alexander Skarsgard, Ellen Page, Shiloh Fernandez, Toby Kebbell), observing with a mix of horror and infatuation as they execute their violent "jams" on the corporations' key members. \n\nThe East will inevitably draw comparisons to Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene because of the subject matter and its ingenue leading lady.The East is not as much of a psychological profile, but there are interesting similarities - like Durkin, Batmanglij and Marling never really villainize or condemn their subects; instead, they make a point of showing the East's appeal. We, the audience, begin to understand why these troubled young people would find solace and purpose in what is essentially a band of guerrilla terrorists, and, in turn, why Jane is so hypnotized by them. It makes for an uncomfortably provocative watch: as we learn more about the characters, their backgrounds, and the corporations' crimes (which are based in fact), it's hard to determine who the "bad guys" are. I saw the film at a festival where Batmanglij gave a short Q&amp;A after and he revealed that he, Marling, and Page had lived with similar groups (without the terrorism) before and were sympathetic with the East's cause, if not their methods. The sympathy shows in the writing and most of the time that's a good thing, but there are times when it gets closer to bias and muddies otherwise brilliant storytelling - but these are blips in the overall outstanding product. \n\nMarling is, as always, enigmatic and hypnotizing, but she is an observer and lets the other characters do the talking; it takes highly skilled actors to command empathy for villains and the cast doesn't disappoint. Alexander Skarsgard is incredibly charismatic and persuasive, and he fills in the blanks admirably whenever his development is cut short. Patricia Clarkson surprises in an unusual role for her - she hints that her character might be more evil than any of the terrorists she is hunting.

Ellen Page gives a career-best performances and reminds us that she's a force to be reckoned with if only she were given the chance to show off more often.

The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,public sex,nude swimming","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential, she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles, she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard - her second collaboration with director and co- writer Zal Batmanglij, The East, is no exception, and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. \n\nThe film follows Jane Owen (Marling), an undercover security agent, as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend (Jason Ritter) to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group known as The East, who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their covered-up crimes against humans and nature. In between reports to her icy, amoral boss (Patricia Clarkson), Jane slowly grows fascinated with the group, its morals and goals, and its core (Alexander Skarsgard, Ellen Page, Shiloh Fernandez, Toby Kebbell), observing with a mix of horror and infatuation as they execute their violent "jams" on the corporations' key members. \n\nThe East will inevitably draw comparisons to Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene because of the subject matter and its ingenue leading lady.The East is not as much of a psychological profile, but there are interesting similarities - like Durkin, Batmanglij and Marling never really villainize or condemn their subects; instead, they make a point of showing the East's appeal. We, the audience, begin to understand why these troubled young people would find solace and purpose in what is essentially a band of guerrilla terrorists, and, in turn, why Jane is so hypnotized by them. It makes for an uncomfortably provocative watch: as we learn more about the characters, their backgrounds, and the corporations' crimes (which are based in fact), it's hard to determine who the "bad guys" are. I saw the film at a festival where Batmanglij gave a short Q&amp;A after and he revealed that he, Marling, and Page had lived with similar groups (without the terrorism) before and were sympathetic with the East's cause, if not their methods. The sympathy shows in the writing and most of the time that's a good thing, but there are times when it gets closer to bias and muddies otherwise brilliant storytelling - but these are blips in the overall outstanding product. \n\nMarling is, as always, enigmatic and hypnotizing, but she is an observer and lets the other characters do the talking; it takes highly skilled actors to command empathy for villains and the cast doesn't disappoint. Alexander Skarsgard is incredibly charismatic and persuasive, and he fills in the blanks admirably whenever his development is cut short. Patricia Clarkson surprises in an unusual role for her - she hints that her character might be more evil than any of the terrorists she is hunting. Jason Ritter and Hillary Baack are affecting in their small roles, and Julia Ormond dominates her five minutes of screen time - her last scene is perhaps the most haunting in the film. Ellen Page gives a career-best performances and reminds us that she's a force to be reckoned with if only she were given the chance to show off more often. She commands the screen with intimidating animosity from the second she walks on screen and has some genuinely heartbreaking moments later on. \n\nIn spite of occasional misfires, the screenplay is exceptional especially in its efficiency: there is so much going on that there isn't much time to devote to individual characters or relationships - Marling and Ritter's suffers the most - but Marling and Batmanglij make every second count as each line is weighted with enough subtext to tell us the stories implicitly and thoroughly nevertheless. The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,public sex,nude swimming","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

Depiction of Chin Gigante is so wrong. Potentially rich character seen as a common thug but in reality he became head of the Five Families. Unlike in this show, they never said his name or called him Chin under penalty of death. And Cassius Clay vs Doug Jones was a 10-round fight, not for a championship. Clay's management group from Louisville is sorely misrepresented. Clay never met with Chin or was asked to take a dive against Jones. They fought a close fight at the old Garden, many thought Jones won. It was early 1963 and Clay's 18th pro fight; two bouts later and he beat Sonny Liston for the title.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9796,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-29","keywords":"harlem manhattan new york city,violence,gang war,gang,gang leader","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001845/","name":"Forest Whitaker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0857101/","name":"Nigel Thatch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3947644/","name":"Ilfenesh Hadera"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104333/","name":"Chris Brancato","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0248746/","name":"Paul Eckstein"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch Season 2 Now","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3381444633","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M0MWEwYjUtZmI1YS00M2ZmLWIwMTctNmExOGU3NTdhZTFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M0MWEwYjUtZmI1YS00M2ZmLWIwMTctNmExOGU3NTdhZTFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"Season 2 finds Bumpy Johnson battling the New York Crime Families for control of the lucrative and murderous "French Connection" heroin pipeline in an ambitious plan that will pit him against not only the Italians and the law but also friends and family."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'd like to say something positive but I really can't think of anything right now. The plot, dialogue, characters, acting, cinematography, lighting, everything was just awful.\n\nI don't usually take note of accents in movies, if the characterisations are fine then I usually just gloss over them. It says a lot that even I noticed how bad and inconsistent these were.\n\nThe backstories were glossed over and only partially explored for the most part with glaring holes in most of them.\n\nThe "hospital" setting was not set up, explained, or even logically consistent. If you don't know who is behind it with a certain name drop, then you won't get any answers here.\n\nJust bad. Bad and a waste of your time. Watch literally anything else. Go for a walk.

Of course you have action star Bruce Willis returning to the John McClane character. But the movie also have talents such as Justin Long, Maggie Q, Cliff Curtis and Timothy Olyphant on the cast list. I was thrilled to see that they cast Timothy Olyphant for the villain in "Live Free or Die Hard", however he just wasn't given as much material to work with as the previous villains did in the previous 3 movies, so his character came off as being less detailed and interesting actually, which was a shame, because Olyphant is a good actor.\n\nThe storyline in "Live Free or Die Hard" deviates somewhat from the formula used on the previous three movies, for better or worse. I guess this gamble from writers Mark Bomback and David Marconi is something that you either like or dislike.

Of course you have action star Bruce Willis returning to the John McClane character. But the movie also have talents such as Justin Long, Maggie Q, Cliff Curtis and Timothy Olyphant on the cast list. I was thrilled to see that they cast Timothy Olyphant for the villain in "Live Free or Die Hard", however he just wasn't given as much material to work with as the previous villains did in the previous 3 movies, so his character came off as being less detailed and interesting actually, which was a shame, because Olyphant is a good actor.\n\nThe storyline in "Live Free or Die Hard" deviates somewhat from the formula used on the previous three movies, for better or worse. I guess this gamble from writers Mark Bomback and David Marconi is something that you either like or dislike. Personally, I enjoyed it, as it brought some freshness to the franchise, while it kept the essence of the franchise at heart.\n\nMy rating of "Live Free or Die Hard" lands on a 7 out of 10 stars, once the dust has settled.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":396217,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-06-27","keywords":"ford crown victoria,hacker,hacking,cyber terrorist,washington d.c.","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Live Free or Die Hard","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2534908953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMwYzEzY2EtOTQ0NS00YzQxLWE2NzctMTg3Njc5YzU1NzlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzMwYzEzY2EtOTQ0NS00YzQxLWE2NzctMTg3Njc5YzU1NzlmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Live Free or Die Hard","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000246/","name":"Bruce Willis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0519043/","name":"Justin Long","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0648249/","name":"Timothy Olyphant"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936482/","name":"Len Wiseman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0136728/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1985343/","name":"John Carlin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0861636/","name":"Roderick Thorp","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093560/","name":"Mark Bomback"],"duration":"PT2H8M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

To begin with, the farm's owners neither want nor need a custodian. Then his solitude is broken by one of his former students, a young girl who's had it with her materialistic parents. And by some con artists, some cyclists, at least one self-proclaimed poet, the girl's parents, the farm's owners, and ultimately the police. So much for lazy-ing around in the hazy countryside.

Andrzej Jaminowski, 87 m. When Jasiak, a retired school teacher, decides to act as custodian of a deserted farm in the Polish countryside, he finds the easy life more than he bargained for. To begin with, the farm's owners neither want nor need a custodian. Then his solitude is broken by one of his former students, a young girl who's had it with her materialistic parents. And by some con artists, some cyclists, at least one self-proclaimed poet, the girl's parents, the farm's owners, and ultimately the police. So much for lazy-ing around in the hazy countryside. You might call Squint Your Eyes a provocative, philosophical comedy.Nick Salerno","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":891,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-10-24","keywords":"farm,ex teacher,rural setting,unemployment,isolation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0952498/","name":"Zbigniew Zamachowski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1437136/","name":"Olga Prószynska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435653/","name":"Rafal Guzniczak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109608/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109606/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126437/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Back then, the politics wasn't perceived as being the result of just one single mad man. It was a huge and, back then, popular organization that was ruling the country. I haven't read the original book; probably it's written the same way, but if it does, then it's, too, not using the words that have been used back then and written from a retrospective.

Even the situation where the train conductor checks for the family name is depicted like they were just buying a pound of butter.\n\nWhich brings me to mention the completely irrelevant and petty musical score. I wouldn't call the few dull notes in the movie a "score" anyway. The musical score didn't at all convey any emotion whatsoever.\n\nThe depicted situations all were so nugatory staged and poorly scored, it was often utterly hard to bear. When the family left their mansion at the beginning of the movie I begged for some emotional musical score to convey the loss. But no, why bother viewers with emotion ...\n\nThen, dialogs were often spoken like being read from a text sheet. The intonation was horrible. Important words were hidden in a discharge of words. No pause was disturbing the spate.\n\nThe only exception to the cast was the elder woman playing the housekeeper/nanny. She was acting marvellously, conveying emotions from every word and every micromotion. And I felt the actor depicting the son character acting quite authentic.\n\nFinally, I don't quite unterstand why French scenes were subtitled while the Swiss actors (even the children) were to talk German instead of Swiss German. The children even were dubbed. Well, as I wrote before, the flick was implausible to many regards.\n\nFor everyone who wants to follow a year in a child's live bothered with some relocations but otherwise living a life everyone else lived back then, they will enjoy the movie. But for everyone else, expecting only a fraction of a quality flick like "Der Engel mit der Posaune", they will certainly be disappointed.

I loved the whole premise of the first one, and having a sequel opened up whole new opportunities. I was excited when I saw all these famous characters from history being mashed together, Al Capone, Napoleon Bonaparte, Amelia Earhart, to name a few. \n\nI walked into the theater not expecting to much, but when I left I was very happy with it. They handled every characters personality beautifully, and the inside jokes were hilarious. I don't want to give much away, but trust me, you'll laugh. It tackles many themes like, a house divided cannot stand, the way to happiness is doing what you love, don't dwell on the past, etc. For a family flick they handle this jumbled cast of characters with complex personalities amazingly. They threw away most of the characters from the first movie to make way for the newer characters, which I didn't like that much, but how many characters can you throw in a story to have it make sense?\n\nThis film is an amazing example of a movie made for kids and adults. Kids will enjoy the silly humor, and the monkey. While adults will laugh at the onslaught of in-jokes, and trust me, there's a lot.\n\nAll in all, this was a great movie, blew me away. The highlight for me was Hank Azaria, that lisp kills me every time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":185025,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2009-05-20","keywords":"al capone character,darth vader character,theodore roosevelt character,abraham lincoln character,albert einstein character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1663697689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE1MDI2NTk1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAyNjkxMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE1MDI2NTk1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAyNjkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Security guard Larry Daley infiltrates the Smithsonian Institute in order to rescue Jedediah and Octavius, who have been shipped to the museum by mistake."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010736/","name":"Amy Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158853/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0304830/","name":"Robert Ben Garant"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0502073/","name":"Thomas Lennon"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I loved the whole premise of the first one, and having a sequel opened up whole new opportunities. I was excited when I saw all these famous characters from history being mashed together, Al Capone, Napoleon Bonaparte, Amelia Earhart, to name a few. \n\nI walked into the theater not expecting to much, but when I left I was very happy with it. They handled every characters personality beautifully, and the inside jokes were hilarious. I don't want to give much away, but trust me, you'll laugh. It tackles many themes like, a house divided cannot stand, the way to happiness is doing what you love, don't dwell on the past, etc. For a family flick they handle this jumbled cast of characters with complex personalities amazingly. They threw away most of the characters from the first movie to make way for the newer characters, which I didn't like that much, but how many characters can you throw in a story to have it make sense?\n\nThis film is an amazing example of a movie made for kids and adults. Kids will enjoy the silly humor, and the monkey. While adults will laugh at the onslaught of in-jokes, and trust me, there's a lot.\n\nAll in all, this was a great movie, blew me away. The highlight for me was Hank Azaria, that lisp kills me every time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":185025,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2009-05-20","keywords":"al capone character,darth vader character,theodore roosevelt character,abraham lincoln character,albert einstein character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1663697689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE1MDI2NTk1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAyNjkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE1MDI2NTk1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAyNjkxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Security guard Larry Daley infiltrates the Smithsonian Institute in order to rescue Jedediah and Octavius, who have been shipped to the museum by mistake.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0010736/","name":"Amy Adams"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158853/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0304830/","name":"Robert Ben Garant","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0502073/","name":"Thomas Lennon"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

More than a film, a powerful - delicate poem about options and the hell of loneliness, pressure and obsession about career, illusions - in the style of Tennesee Williams plays and the cruel reality.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-09-19","keywords":"female nudity,topless female nudity,shower,bicycle,cyclist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Angel","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi873644057","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE0MTc3MDktZmRkMy00YWRiLWE3NDUtNTE2YjA3ZjJjZGVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE0MTc3MDktZmRkMy00YWRiLWE3NDUtNTE2YjA3ZjJjZGVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0618456/","name":"Fatou N'Diaye","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1196219/","name":"Vincent Rottiers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4080592/","name":"Paul Bartel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0607831/","name":"Koen Mortier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0181156/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098159/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0607831/","name":"Koen Mortier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2329684/","name":"Dimitri Verhulst"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is set July 18 , 1936 , Salamanca, Castilla and León (center to Spain) , as the Spanish army declares in the city the state of wa r, hoping to extend it to the rest of Spain and improve the unstable situation in the country after the proclamation of the Second Republic five years ago . Here Unamuno (Karra Elejalde) supports the new revolt in the hope to clean the country of the undesirable elements for desperation of his close friends teacher Salvador and priest Atilano, creating too problems in his house where Miguel lives with his daughters María (Patricia López Arnaiz) and Felisa (Inma Cuevas) , his servant Aurelia and his grandson Miguelín (Arnau) . At the same time that Salamanca's mayor Casto Prieto (Mariano Llorente) is detained without cause apparent and his spouse Ana Carrasco (Nathalie Poza) asks help Miguel de Unamuno . While Joint Chiefs of Staff meet deciding the strategy to take the power , where General Astray-Millán (Eduard Fernandez) , General Franco's right-hand, proposes to elect the own Franco as leader despite the opposition of General Cabanellas (Tito Valverde) , who fears Franco eliminates the Republic he loves to change it for a dictatorship . When Atilano (Luis Zahera) disappears suddenly , his wife Enriqueta reports Miguel de Unamuno about his arrest while Salvador (Carlos Serrano) attempts to alert him about the real intentions of the military revolution : turn Spain into a rigid dictatorship. As Francisco Franco (Santi Prego) is named Chief of Staff of the Spanish Army and Unamuno decides to make him a special request . Later on , Unamuno had a public quarrel with the Nationalist general Millán Astray at the university in which he denounced both Astray-with whom he had had verbal battles in the 1920s-and elements of the rebel movement. He called the battle cry of the elite Spanish Legion-"Long live death!"-repellent and suggested Astray wanted to see Spain crippled. One historian notes that his address was a "remarkable act of moral courage" and that he risked being lynched on the spot but was saved by Franco's wife, who took him out of the place . Shortly afterwards, Unamuno was effectively removed for a second time from the rectorship of the University of Salamanca .\n\nA good drama based on historical events , though the film has several errors and false remarks . It narrates itself Unamuno's life in Salamanca , being first-hand witness of the deeds that will change Spain forever. Here Unamuno is a contradictory , reluctant , complex person who finally becomes an ashamed and sad man , questioning himself and his previous posture . Karra Elejalde delivers a terrific acting as an aging Miguel de Unamuno, not only writer and academic teacher but one of the most recognized intellectuals in Spain, disappointed with the Republic that publicly he helped to create . While Eduard Fernandez gives a fine performance as the relentless one-eyed, one-armed and one-legged General Millan Astray , though overacting , at times ; as Eduard deservedly won a Goya Award : the best support cast . In the picture appears various historical characters represented by fine secondary actors , such as : Tito Valverde as General Miguel Cabanellas , Luis Callejo as General Mola , Luis Bermejo as Nicolás Franco , Enrique Ajenjo as José Maria Pemán , Santi Prego as General Francisco Franco who gets complete political and military powers after the Alcázar de Toledo's battle and Mireia Rey as his wife Carmen Polo .\n\nIt contains an evocative and adequate cinematography by Alex Catalán . As well as a sensitive and exciting musical score by Amenabar himself . The motion picture was well directed by Alejandro Amenábar . At his beginning Amenábar made some Short-Films , he progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with "Thesis" produced by José Luis Cuerda , a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene. Later "Abre Los Ojos" or ¨Open your eyes¨(1997) was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky (2001), starring Tom Cruise and "Los Otros" or ¨The Others¨ confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world , in which Tom Cruise was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . ¨Los Otros" enhanced his prestige in the cinematographic world and is Amenábar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the all-time worldwide box office history . In all his films he also writes the script and the music, as well as composing the music for other films, most notably "La Lengua de las Mariposas" (1999) or Butterflies tongue" (1999). He also directed ¨Mar Adentro¨ with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and the epic/historical ¨Agora¨ with Rachel Weisz , among others .\n\n This film ¨Mientras dure la guerra¨ is based on facts , the actual happenings are as follows : On 12 October 1936 the celebration of Columbus Day had brought together a politically diverse crowd at the University of Salamanca, including Enrique Pla y Deniel, the Archbishop of Salamanca, and Carmen Polo Martínez-Valdés, the wife of Franco, Falangist General José Millán Astray and Unamuno himself. The evening began with an impassioned speech by the Falangist writer José María Pemán. After this, Professor Francisco Maldonado decried Catalonia and the Basque Country as "cancers on the body of the nation," adding that "Fascism, the healer of Spain, will know how to exterminate them, cutting into the live flesh, like a determined surgeon free from false sentimentalism" .From somewhere in the auditorium, someone cried out the motto "¡Viva la Muerte!" . As was his habit, Millán Astray responded with "¡España!"; the crowd replied with "¡Una!" . He repeated "¡España!"; the crowd then replied "¡Grande!" . A third time, Millán Astray shouted "¡España!"; the crowd responded "Libre!"This - Spain, one, great and free - was a common Falangist cheer and would become a francoist motto thereafter. Later, a group of uniformed Falangists entered, saluting the portrait of Franco that hung on the wall. Then Unamuno adressed the crowd : I have heard this insensitive and necrophilous oath, "¡Viva la Muerte!", and I, having spent my life writing paradoxes that have provoked the ire of those who do not understand what I have written, and being an expert in this matter, find this ridiculous paradox repellent. General Millán Astray is a cripple. There is no need for us to say this with whispered tones. He is a war cripple. So was Cervantes. But unfortunately, Spain today has too many cripples. And, if God does not help us, soon it will have very many more. It torments me to think that General Millán Astray could dictate the norms of the psychology of the masses. A cripple, who lacks the spiritual greatness of Cervantes, hopes to find relief by adding to the number of cripples around him. Millán Astray responded: "Death to intelligence! Long live death!" provoking applause from the Falangists. Pemán, in an effort to calm the crowd, exclaimed "No! Long live intelligence! Death to the bad intellectuals!" Unamuno continued: "This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win , because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince .

It is set July 18 , 1936 , Salamanca, Castilla and León (center to Spain) , as the Spanish army declares in the city the state of wa r, hoping to extend it to the rest of Spain and improve the unstable situation in the country after the proclamation of the Second Republic five years ago . Here Unamuno (Karra Elejalde) supports the new revolt in the hope to clean the country of the undesirable elements for desperation of his close friends teacher Salvador and priest Atilano, creating too problems in his house where Miguel lives with his daughters María (Patricia López Arnaiz) and Felisa (Inma Cuevas) , his servant Aurelia and his grandson Miguelín (Arnau) . At the same time that Salamanca's mayor Casto Prieto (Mariano Llorente) is detained without cause apparent and his spouse Ana Carrasco (Nathalie Poza) asks help Miguel de Unamuno . While Joint Chiefs of Staff meet deciding the strategy to take the power , where General Astray-Millán (Eduard Fernandez) , General Franco's right-hand, proposes to elect the own Franco as leader despite the opposition of General Cabanellas (Tito Valverde) , who fears Franco eliminates the Republic he loves to change it for a dictatorship . When Atilano (Luis Zahera) disappears suddenly , his wife Enriqueta reports Miguel de Unamuno about his arrest while Salvador (Carlos Serrano) attempts to alert him about the real intentions of the military revolution : turn Spain into a rigid dictatorship. As Francisco Franco (Santi Prego) is named Chief of Staff of the Spanish Army and Unamuno decides to make him a special request . Later on , Unamuno had a public quarrel with the Nationalist general Millán Astray at the university in which he denounced both Astray-with whom he had had verbal battles in the 1920s-and elements of the rebel movement. He called the battle cry of the elite Spanish Legion-"Long live death!"-repellent and suggested Astray wanted to see Spain crippled. One historian notes that his address was a "remarkable act of moral courage" and that he risked being lynched on the spot but was saved by Franco's wife, who took him out of the place . Shortly afterwards, Unamuno was effectively removed for a second time from the rectorship of the University of Salamanca .\n\nA good drama based on historical events , though the film has several errors and false remarks . It narrates itself Unamuno's life in Salamanca , being first-hand witness of the deeds that will change Spain forever. Here Unamuno is a contradictory , reluctant , complex person who finally becomes an ashamed and sad man , questioning himself and his previous posture . Karra Elejalde delivers a terrific acting as an aging Miguel de Unamuno, not only writer and academic teacher but one of the most recognized intellectuals in Spain, disappointed with the Republic that publicly he helped to create . While Eduard Fernandez gives a fine performance as the relentless one-eyed, one-armed and one-legged General Millan Astray , though overacting , at times ; as Eduard deservedly won a Goya Award : the best support cast . In the picture appears various historical characters represented by fine secondary actors , such as : Tito Valverde as General Miguel Cabanellas , Luis Callejo as General Mola , Luis Bermejo as Nicolás Franco , Enrique Ajenjo as José Maria Pemán , Santi Prego as General Francisco Franco who gets complete political and military powers after the Alcázar de Toledo's battle and Mireia Rey as his wife Carmen Polo .\n\nIt contains an evocative and adequate cinematography by Alex Catalán . As well as a sensitive and exciting musical score by Amenabar himself . The motion picture was well directed by Alejandro Amenábar . At his beginning Amenábar made some Short-Films , he progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with "Thesis" produced by José Luis Cuerda , a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene. Later "Abre Los Ojos" or ¨Open your eyes¨(1997) was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky (2001), starring Tom Cruise and "Los Otros" or ¨The Others¨ confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world , in which Tom Cruise was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . ¨Los Otros" enhanced his prestige in the cinematographic world and is Amenábar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the all-time worldwide box office history . In all his films he also writes the script and the music, as well as composing the music for other films, most notably "La Lengua de las Mariposas" (1999) or Butterflies tongue" (1999). He also directed ¨Mar Adentro¨ with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and the epic/historical ¨Agora¨ with Rachel Weisz , among others .\n\n This film ¨Mientras dure la guerra¨ is based on facts , the actual happenings are as follows : On 12 October 1936 the celebration of Columbus Day had brought together a politically diverse crowd at the University of Salamanca, including Enrique Pla y Deniel, the Archbishop of Salamanca, and Carmen Polo Martínez-Valdés, the wife of Franco, Falangist General José Millán Astray and Unamuno himself. The evening began with an impassioned speech by the Falangist writer José María Pemán. After this, Professor Francisco Maldonado decried Catalonia and the Basque Country as "cancers on the body of the nation," adding that "Fascism, the healer of Spain, will know how to exterminate them, cutting into the live flesh, like a determined surgeon free from false sentimentalism" .From somewhere in the auditorium, someone cried out the motto "¡Viva la Muerte!" . As was his habit, Millán Astray responded with "¡España!"; the crowd replied with "¡Una!" . He repeated "¡España!"; the crowd then replied "¡Grande!" . A third time, Millán Astray shouted "¡España!"; the crowd responded "Libre!"This - Spain, one, great and free - was a common Falangist cheer and would become a francoist motto thereafter. Later, a group of uniformed Falangists entered, saluting the portrait of Franco that hung on the wall. Then Unamuno adressed the crowd : I have heard this insensitive and necrophilous oath, "¡Viva la Muerte!", and I, having spent my life writing paradoxes that have provoked the ire of those who do not understand what I have written, and being an expert in this matter, find this ridiculous paradox repellent. General Millán Astray is a cripple. There is no need for us to say this with whispered tones. He is a war cripple. So was Cervantes. But unfortunately, Spain today has too many cripples. And, if God does not help us, soon it will have very many more. It torments me to think that General Millán Astray could dictate the norms of the psychology of the masses. A cripple, who lacks the spiritual greatness of Cervantes, hopes to find relief by adding to the number of cripples around him. Millán Astray responded: "Death to intelligence! Long live death!" provoking applause from the Falangists. Pemán, in an effort to calm the crowd, exclaimed "No! Long live intelligence! Death to the bad intellectuals!" Unamuno continued: "This is the temple of intelligence, and I am its high priest. You are profaning its sacred domain. You will win , because you have enough brute force. But you will not convince . In order to convince it is necessary to persuade, and to persuade you will need something that you lack: reason and right in the struggle. I see it is useless to ask you to think of Spain. I have spoken." Millán Astray, controlling himself, shouted "Take the lady's arm!" Unamuno took Carmen Polo by the arm and left under her protection.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6038,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-27","keywords":"spanish civil war,1930s,year 1936,general franco,based on real events","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tráiler [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4248288281","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU0YTQwMzgtNzA0OS00NWM5LWIzZTMtZjI1ZjBmMGQ4MGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGU0YTQwMzgtNzA0OS00NWM5LWIzZTMtZjI1ZjBmMGQ4MGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253216/","name":"Karra Elejalde","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0273464/","name":"Eduard Fernández","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1139204/","name":"Santi Prego"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024622/","name":"Alejandro Amenábar"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0233438/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0544623/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0101420/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0024622/","name":"Alejandro Amenábar","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379864/","name":"Alejandro Hernández"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Imagine you are being falsely accused of a terrorist act that killed and injured people. You are the FBI's primary suspect. Your name and face are spread across every possible media outlet. Your belongings have been searched and seized as evidence - right down to your mom's Tupperware. Cameras follow your every step of every day. Now imagine all of this occurs mere days after your actions actually saved lives and you were hailed as a hero across all of those same media outlets. Richard Jewell didn't have to imagine this, as he lived this nightmare in 1996.\n\nWe first see Richard (played by Paul Walter Hauser in one of the year's best performances) as a supply clerk at a law firm in 1986. His awkward ways and surprising efficiency catches the eye of attorney Watson Bryant (Oscar winner Sam Rockwell), a quasi-connection that comes into play a decade later. We then jump ahead those 10 years to find Richard being fired from his campus security job at a college due to his over-zealous focus on protocol. Fortunately for Richard, the Olympics are coming to Atlanta, so finding work as a security guard is pretty easy.\n\nAtlanta's Centennial Olympic Park is shown with crowds of people cheering at a Kenny Rogers and later dancing the Macarena. As one of the on-site security guards, Richard spots a suspicious backpack that turns out to be holding the bomb that detonates, creating tragedy for many. As the viewing audience, we know that Richard's actions saved lives and he most definitely was not responsible for planting the bomb. And it's that knowing that places us as close as possible to the Richard Jewell experience.\n\nFour-time Oscar winner Clint Eastwood directs yet another story of a working-class hero. Only this time, he blatantly calls out what he sees as two evil forces: the U.S. Government (the FBI) and the media. Billy Ray (CAPTAIN PHILLIPS, SHATTERED GLASS) based his script on the 1997 Vanity Fair article "American Nightmare: The Ballad of Richard Jewell" by Marie Brenner (who also wrote the article that was the source for THE INSIDER, 1999). It can be argued that Eastwood comes down hard on the FBI and the media, but you might consider putting yourself in Richard Jewell's shoes before crying foul.\n\nJon Hamm has perfected the role of cocksure FBI agent and here he plays Tom Shaw as the man totally focused on proving Richard Jewell was the perpetrator. Much has been made of Eastwood's depiction of Atlanta Journal-Constitution reporter Kathy Scruggs (played by Olivia Wilde, who directed this year's surprise hit BOOKSMART). It's a bit curious that the uproar is over what some interpret as a reporter trading intimate relations for a scoop, yet Eastwood's contempt seems focused more on the idea of trying a citizen's case in public ... while lacking any real evidence outside of a profile. The reporter (Ms. Scruggs passed away in 2001) is certainly portrayed as an ultra-aggressive reporter desperate for a headline story, but the implied consensual affair occurred after the inside information was provided - and the FBI agent was actually surprised... "Is this really going to happen?" Perhaps the viewer reaction to this is a sign of the times, but I'm guessing if any one of Eastwood's critics were similarly falsely accused (as Jewell), the fictionalized version of the reporter would be less important than having the truth discovered. Of course, this could have been easily avoided had the name of the reporter been changed for the film.\n\nTwo key supporting roles come courtesy of Oscar winner Kathy Bates as Richard's mother Bobi, and Nina Arianda as Watson Bryant's paralegal. Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right. A rush to judgment can be seen as an abuse of power, whether it's by the media, a law enforcement agency, or folks on social media. At this stage of his career, director Eastwood seems more interested in telling stories than showing one. He offers up little visual artistry outside of the terrific performances, but this story ... it's a doozy.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74442,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"}],"duration":"PT2H11M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Ms. Bates starts out as a loving and simple mother to Richard, but her press conference captures the character in a new light. It's a strong and heartfelt performance. Ms. Arianda brings some warmth sprinkled with welcome sarcasm to her role. Mr. Hauser is spot-on in every scene, and when these four are all together, it's a pleasure to watch. Hauser and Rockwell are especially good in their scenes together as the 'wronged man' contrasted with the take-no-guff attorney.\n\nEvery time Richard says "I'm law enforcement too", it's heart-breaking to us and an opening for the FBI to manipulate him. The profile of a single white male living at home with his mom, carrying gung-ho dreams of a career in law enforcement, while collecting guns and knowledge on bombs and police procedure, made Richard Jewell seem like the kind of guy who would do something for attention. However, the film and the true story both emphasize the danger of prematurely persecuting individuals - especially in public. These days the race is always about who is first with a story, rather than who is right. A rush to judgment can be seen as an abuse of power, whether it's by the media, a law enforcement agency, or folks on social media. At this stage of his career, director Eastwood seems more interested in telling stories than showing one. He offers up little visual artistry outside of the terrific performances, but this story ... it's a doozy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74442,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-13","keywords":"trial by media,media bias,false accusation,scapegoat,atlanta georgia","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1837612825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWE4Mjk4YjgtOWQ3Yy00YTY2LTgxMWYtNWI4OWFlMmY4ZDEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The World Will Know His Name and the Truth","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3236159/","name":"Paul Walter Hauser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005377/","name":"Sam Rockwell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10263413/","name":"Brandon Stanley"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0085725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0509662/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0712753/","name":"Billy Ray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107493/","name":"Marie Brenner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7471755/","name":"Kent Alexander"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A huge hit on the festival circuit and the Icelandic entry for the Oscars, it should also prove very popular with art-house audiences.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-09-06","keywords":"female frontal nudity,male nudity,female nudity,male rear nudity,male frontal nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A White, White Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi306495257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjBjZDI5MjktZTFlOC00MjJkLWI1ZGEtOTAwODZlNWY4NWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjBjZDI5MjktZTFlOC00MjJkLWI1ZGEtOTAwODZlNWY4NWJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0797614/","name":"Ingvar Sigurdsson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10588371/","name":"Ída Mekkín Hlynsdóttir","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350273/","name":"Hilmir Snær Guðnason"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6249843/","name":"Hlynur Pálmason"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0404626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035146/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001935/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6249843/","name":"Hlynur Pálmason"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Big mistake.\n\nI'm gutted to say that this film has none of what makes Terminator 2 one of the best films of all time. The writing is below par, plot uninteresting and emotional connection between the Terminator and John Connor, none of that either. James Cameron, what is this? Mind, I don't think he's been on form for a good few years now.\n\nWhat makes Terminator 2 an amazing film aside from the brilliant plot, amazing effects, great screen writing and superb acting is the emotional connection between the Terminator and John Connor. This is the life blood of that film and makes the viewer really believe that despite the hopeless future humanity is facing, if this Terminator can protect John then maybe mankind has a chance.

Do away with the depth of character building, emotional connections and just add over the top action. It's a poor follow up and lacks everything of what made 1 &amp; 2 great. The acting is decent, Davis, Hamilton and Schwarzenegger do a good job but they've got very little to work with here. This is what disappointed me the most. Why does it lack substance? This is James Cameron's epic creation and this is what he serves up along with Tim Miller? A total cash in if I've ever seen one. I'm not going to divulge into the plot anymore, there's no need as it can't even be mentioned in the same breath as the first two films.\n\nIf this film was viewed as a generic action film at the cinema it'd still be mediocre. The fact that this is supposed to follow on from the brilliant Terminator 2 just makes it even more disappointing. This is James Cameron's judgment day.\n\nDo yourselves a favour and wait until it hits home release or if you are planning on seeing it, don't bother watching the first two beforehand, you'll be even more disappointed.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":162238,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-10-31","keywords":"robot,mexico,revenge,2010s,nude woman","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Terminator: Dark Fate","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3787112217","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Q0NTg2NmQtMDkyNC00ZjUzLTg2MDAtMzM1MjJlNWIyY2MwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2Q0NTg2NmQtMDkyNC00ZjUzLTg2MDAtMzM1MjJlNWIyY2MwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000157/","name":"Linda Hamilton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4496875/","name":"Mackenzie Davis"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1783265/","name":"Tim Miller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275286/","name":"David S.

Jones' desire to investigate the USSR's mysterious source of cash for their worldwide industrial spending spree turns into a fast-paced, life and death series of events that include a trip into the wintry hell of starving Ukrainian villagers, the debauched revelry of foreign journalists in Moscow, international blackmail, and what it means to uphold the cause of truth and justice against all odds. Outstanding performances by James Norton as Gareth Jones, the main protagonist and Peter Sarsgaard as the Pulitzer prize winning (and since discredited) journalist Walter Duranty. Looking forward to watching it again with friends!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8697,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-10-25","keywords":"ukraine,soviet union,holodomor,famine,genocide","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi392806169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjliNjIxNmUtZmQ0Ny00YjRkLWFmYTgtM2NlMDQ3MmZmOTAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjliNjIxNmUtZmQ0Ny00YjRkLWFmYTgtM2NlMDQ3MmZmOTAwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Gareth Jones, an ambitious Welsh journalist, travelled to the Soviet Union in 1933 and uncovered the appalling truth behind the Soviet "utopia".

About a year ago I checked it out on IMDb and discovered no copies available. I then hit the web and found a site that offers War Films, soooo glad that I did, ordered a copy and sat back and was able to confirm why I wanted to see it again.\n\nIn my opinion to really enjoy the film I suggest you read get a copy of the book and then watch the film. The book is no longer in print but I did track a copy down via E-bay, the Author Alan White was a commando/paratrooper during the 2nd world war taking part in disparate clandestine operations and this was his first book. It is written by someone who knows and this fact I believe gives the book and film authenticity. I have not given the film a ten only because of the nature of the ending of the film, not as good as the book. There are a couple of plot lines that differ from the book also, which is strange as the book is not about the large scale nature of war but about the individual in war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. I have the copy of the book to let my son read and then the film to let him watch, in that order.\n\nIf you can track it down the book and the film then it is definitely worth it and I only wish that it was more readily available for more to read and see, one of my all best war films, ever!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":470,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1968-05-28","keywords":"shot to death,no survivors,farmhouse,corpse,cult film","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0376101/","name":"David Hemmings"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0065777/","name":"Tony Beckley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068552/","name":"Tom Bell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0172772/","name":"Peter Collinson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010407/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0924430/","name":"Alan White"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939606/","name":"Charles Wood"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

About a year ago I checked it out on IMDb and discovered no copies available. I then hit the web and found a site that offers War Films, soooo glad that I did, ordered a copy and sat back and was able to confirm why I wanted to see it again.\n\nIn my opinion to really enjoy the film I suggest you read get a copy of the book and then watch the film. The book is no longer in print but I did track a copy down via E-bay, the Author Alan White was a commando/paratrooper during the 2nd world war taking part in disparate clandestine operations and this was his first book. It is written by someone who knows and this fact I believe gives the book and film authenticity. I have not given the film a ten only because of the nature of the ending of the film, not as good as the book. There are a couple of plot lines that differ from the book also, which is strange as the book is not about the large scale nature of war but about the individual in war. The film illustrates this exceptionally well. I have the copy of the book to let my son read and then the film to let him watch, in that order.\n\nIf you can track it down the book and the film then it is definitely worth it and I only wish that it was more readily available for more to read and see, one of my all best war films, ever!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":470,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","War"],"datePublished":"1968-05-28","keywords":"shot to death,no survivors,farmhouse,corpse,cult film","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0376101/","name":"David Hemmings","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0065777/","name":"Tony Beckley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068552/","name":"Tom Bell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0172772/","name":"Peter Collinson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010407/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0924430/","name":"Alan White","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0939606/","name":"Charles Wood"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I like Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise etc, but I wouldn't be able to pinpoint a classic actor's performance. But Russell Crowe in this film showed me what it was like to act in a way where I was in awe of his skill in playing this character, especially when considering the extreme difference from characters in his other movies such as the Gladiator and The Insider. Russell Crowe was one of the big reasons this movie was so brilliant. Added to that the stellar performances of Jennifer Connelly, Ed Harris and Adam Goldberg, and this made for the 'perfect' movie.\n\n A Beautiful Mind was by far the most original, intelligent and entertaining movie I have ever seen. And this from a movie I didn't expect big things from. Kudos to Ron Howard, the cast and the crew of this movie. It was truly worthy of the Oscar, and Russell Crowe was definately the most deserving of this production team to miss out on the highest accolade.

Archaeologist and explorer extraordinaire, Lara Croft, journeys to a temple which has sunken underwater in search of lost treasures. During her expedition, Croft happens upon a sphere that contains the mythical Pandora's Box, only to have it stolen from her by Chen Lo, the leader of a Chinese crime syndicate. Chen Lo is in league with a bad guy named Reiss, who wants to use the priceless Box as a doomsday weapon. The plot sounds okay but the main reason someone would see this film is for the action scenes and Angelina Jolie. People just wanting those two things will probably enjoy this film. People that want a good story and better direction should skip this film. The action scenes are really cool and are done well. However, the story is weak and the film doesn't quite make sense at times either. I think the person that should be blamed is Jan de Bont. He is a terrible director and can't build up suspense very well. He did a bit better then Simon West but still the studio should have hired someone else. The acting is good not great but nothing horrible either. Angelina Jolie does a good job of playing Lara Croft and she is also very breathtaking in the film. Gerard Butler does a good job as well though sometimes his performance wasn't very interesting. The action scenes are really cool and are done well. Another problem I had with this film is that it gets boring at times. Having a lot of action doesn't mean its audience will be entertained. The movie's running time is 117 minutes which is a bit longer then the original. I think they could have cut the film down to about the same length as there some pointless scenes. If you hated the original then you should skip this film as the film is more of the same but it is more entertaining. As long as you don't try to notice too many of the mistakes in the film then you should enjoy it. If your looking for a serious action flick then just skip this.

Brad is all over the place. The film starts with a great sequence for approx. 7 minutes, which is captivating and visually stunning. Unfortunately, then it gets to a slow-burn mode till the story develops a bit more and we get to see another visually impressive sequence past 30 minutes. It does get more interesting later on and together with the visual impact (a kind of dreamy action sequences) and the nicely written score you will want to sit this through the end. Acting is good and for fans of Brad Pitt, this works perfect as he is in almost every scene. Science...well i am not an expert here but the things portrayed in the film are not really tied to exact science. It is the future after all and humanity knows more, right? I would not read too much into that; it will help you enjoy the film more. In contrast with some negative and maybe unrealistic reviews that I read here, if you like a mix of mild father-son drama together with sci-fi, this is a very nice film to watch. 8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213295,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-09-20","keywords":"astronaut,outer space,father son relationship,moon,missing father","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ad Astra","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3836788505","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1550948/","name":"Ruth Negga"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0452101/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0719257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1342473/","name":"Ethan Gross"}],"duration":"PT2H3M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Brad is all over the place. The film starts with a great sequence for approx. 7 minutes, which is captivating and visually stunning. Unfortunately, then it gets to a slow-burn mode till the story develops a bit more and we get to see another visually impressive sequence past 30 minutes. It does get more interesting later on and together with the visual impact (a kind of dreamy action sequences) and the nicely written score you will want to sit this through the end. Acting is good and for fans of Brad Pitt, this works perfect as he is in almost every scene. Science...well i am not an expert here but the things portrayed in the film are not really tied to exact science. It is the future after all and humanity knows more, right? I would not read too much into that; it will help you enjoy the film more. In contrast with some negative and maybe unrealistic reviews that I read here, if you like a mix of mild father-son drama together with sci-fi, this is a very nice film to watch. 8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213295,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-09-20","keywords":"astronaut,outer space,father son relationship,moon,missing father","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ad Astra","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3836788505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJkMmViNjAtMzA3NC00N2Q0LWFhZDItZWY5ZTM1MDI3MDc1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1550948/","name":"Ruth Negga"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0452101/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0719257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0336695/","name":"James Gray","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1342473/","name":"Ethan Gross"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In fact, it's a sure sign of cancellation how much I like this show. I never like crime shows. My mom loves them, but I find them dull, because they're about plots not characters. This is a crime show about characters (not as good as "The Closer" -- the crime show I adored this summer -- mind you), and I enjoyed it. At times, it seemed far-fetched, and the whole Senator plot-point in the pilot seemed awful easy, but the dialogue worked, the characters intrigue me, and the chemistry is great. I expect good things from it.\n\nAlison","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145903,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-09-13","keywords":"forensic anthropologist,investigation,washington d.c.,crime scene investigation,murder investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0221043/","name":"Emily Deschanel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004770/","name":"David Boreanaz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0174819/","name":"Michaela Conlin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0212869/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046572/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0361274/","name":"Hart Hanson"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bones: The Complete Seventh Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi748140825","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA2MGRiODItYWI4Zi00ODdhLTg0OWYtMDQ1NmIyODQ2ZGNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA2MGRiODItYWI4Zi00ODdhLTg0OWYtMDQ1NmIyODQ2ZGNlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Bones: The Complete Seventh Season"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It managed to keep (most of) my interest for the entire length. I wanted to punch my tv a lot, which is probably a good sign the makers got out of me the reaction they were looking for.\n\nHighly recommend for anyone and everyone. This story needs to be heard so it isn't repeated, since (spoiler alert) the Sacklers mostly escaped scot free.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary","Crime"],"datePublished":"2021-05-10","keywords":"tv mini series,opioid epidemic,synthetic heroin,opioid crisis,drug epidemic","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2826409/","name":"Patrick Radden Keefe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9465082/","name":"Lenny Bernstein","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12597562/","name":"Gary Blinn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139821/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133364/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0448478/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2330050585","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA2ODY3MjUtNzc4NC00YmNjLWIxNjQtODllZGEyYTIxNGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjA2ODY3MjUtNzc4NC00YmNjLWIxNjQtODllZGEyYTIxNGIzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Crime of the Century, an HBO original documentary from Alex Gibney, exposes the billions of dollars gained and thousands of lives lost due to the opioid crisis.

I was surprised he had the heft to do it, but I agree with the critic who said that the beard helped. He was a man, not a boy.\n\n\n\n* Battle scenes... incredible. I was really surprised that they could wow me, since we've been numbed by the quality of battle scenes in so many previous movies, but they did a great job.\n\n\n\n* Portrayal of the Muslims. EXTREMELY fair. In being "even-handed" to Christians and Muslims there, if anything, they emphasized the Christian fanatics (in the form of the Templars in particular, to simplify things) as being the "badguys" more than anyone else... (which is historically accurate to some degree, in my understanding). I was surprised and pleased that they tried to be accurate, and didn't try to emphasize some "BAD MUSLIMS" to make it "even".\n\n\n\n* Movie is very secular in it's moralizing.\n\n\nAnd it portrays Christianity particularly religious men, VERY badly (the Priest who steals the cross from Bloom's wife's corpse... the Bishop in Jerusalem who's ready to convert to Islam at the first sign of defeat... and who also wants to abandon the civilians... the knights templar...) I thought this got a tad gratuitous. There were really NO GOOD Christian FIGURES IN THE MOVIE. The only good purported Christians were basically acting Agnostic (Bloom, Neeson, etc.) The actual religious Christians were made out to be hypocrites.\n\nMeanwhile Saladhudin was a man of honor.. but also somewhat moderate.\n\n\n* Movie could definitely have a little more narrative focus and maybe have a little more of an emotional circle for Orlando Bloom character. The emotional arc is ALREADY complete fairly early in the movie (Bloom becomes a man of conscience)... and it's kind of boring since the character doesn't really move after that.\n\n\nBut the movie tackled a HUGE topic and tackled it fairly well. I just wish there was a better script to handle the compelling personal journey for Orlando Bloom (from widower, murderer seeking redemption, lost bastard son) that was PROMISED at the beginning.\n\nIt seems that as soon as he brings water to his father's old land, he's just about done his journey, and it turns into a simple historical battle movie.

I was surprised and pleased that they tried to be accurate, and didn't try to emphasize some "BAD MUSLIMS" to make it "even".\n\n\n\n* Movie is very secular in it's moralizing.\n\n\nAnd it portrays Christianity particularly religious men, VERY badly (the Priest who steals the cross from Bloom's wife's corpse... the Bishop in Jerusalem who's ready to convert to Islam at the first sign of defeat... and who also wants to abandon the civilians... the knights templar...) I thought this got a tad gratuitous. There were really NO GOOD Christian FIGURES IN THE MOVIE. The only good purported Christians were basically acting Agnostic (Bloom, Neeson, etc.) The actual religious Christians were made out to be hypocrites.\n\nMeanwhile Saladhudin was a man of honor.. but also somewhat moderate.\n\n\n* Movie could definitely have a little more narrative focus and maybe have a little more of an emotional circle for Orlando Bloom character. The emotional arc is ALREADY complete fairly early in the movie (Bloom becomes a man of conscience)... and it's kind of boring since the character doesn't really move after that.\n\n\nBut the movie tackled a HUGE topic and tackled it fairly well. I just wish there was a better script to handle the compelling personal journey for Orlando Bloom (from widower, murderer seeking redemption, lost bastard son) that was PROMISED at the beginning.\n\nIt seems that as soon as he brings water to his father's old land, he's just about done his journey, and it turns into a simple historical battle movie. (but a darn good one)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":274954,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-05-04","keywords":"crusader,12th century,jerusalem,templar,knights templar","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Kingdom of Heaven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2492727577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M3MmM0NWYtZTQyYi00NzllLTk3YmEtZDMwZDQyZjk2NTM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2M3MmM0NWYtZTQyYi00NzllLTk3YmEtZDMwZDQyZjk2NTM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089217/","name":"Orlando Bloom","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1200692/","name":"Eva Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323361/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1184258/","name":"William Monahan"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt form a perfect chemistry that takes them from the training ground, to the battlefield through to the action-bound finale in Paris. The premise of the time-loop has been used many times before, but this time round there are enough exciting visuals and dynamic storytelling skills employed to make this one thrilling (and unexpectedly comedic) flick that is unpredictable and expertly designed. A model of cinematic craftsmanship.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":629654,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-06-04","keywords":"time loop,alien,dying repeatedly,combat,end of the world","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"IMAX Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3591679257","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Mjk4MTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyNjE4MTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0Mjk4MTI0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjQyNjE4MTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A soldier fighting in a war with aliens finds himself caught in a time loop of his last day in the battle, though he becomes better skilled along the way.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1289434/","name":"Emily Blunt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000200/","name":"Bill Paxton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510731/","name":"Doug Liman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0449458/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0125336/","name":"Jez Butterworth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3890871/","name":"John-Henry Butterworth"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The big bad men are here and they don't care about hurting children. it's time to get nasty.\n\nGone is the frivolity of the first couple of movies where magic was cool and everything in this new and magical world was just wonderful to behold, a la World of Disney. The new director has taken some risks with style and approach and they've paid off brilliantly. Order of the Phoenix is probably the darkest of the five movies we've had so far, even more so than Azkhaban which was a step in the right direction for where the series would eventually be heading. There's very little "fun" in Phoenix and you can see why. The Dark Lord is back, it's no laughing matter and this movie actually sells that fact.\n\nThis (in the movie world at least) is where Harry Potter crosses the line from kids movie to grown ups movie.\n\nHarry now has some serious mental scars (as well as his actual one of course) since the events of the previous movie which while lighter than Azkhaban, followed on well from that movie. The Ministry of Magic is in denial about Voldermorts return and are trying to control the flow of rumour stemming from the events of Goblet. To this end we have new teacher and Ministry stooge Dolores Umbridge. Pink and fluffy on the outside, crunchy and evil on the inside. She makes no qualms about re-ordering the law at Hogwarts putting the kybosh on anything even remotely fun and making the students lives a complete misery. What she put Harry through in detention was simply pure evil.\n\nShe wasn't quite how I pictured her from the book but Imelda Staunton played her with a deliciously bitter/sweet twist, all charming and proper in her righteous delusions with that "stab you in the back" thing going on. She was a nasty piece of work.\n\nIt is a shame that a lot of the content of the book was missing but it was a big book and although I can't put my finger on what wasn't in the movie (I read it a while ago now) it does sometimes feel that there should have more substance to a few areas, mainly the characterisation of some of the characters. Most of the major bits I remember from the book were in the movie. There's a pace here we haven't seen before, a new musical approach also puts a new twist on things and I think Harry Potters world seems to fit it's new clothes well. I'm eagerly anticipating what's next as I hear David Yates is also directing the Half Blood Prince (last I heard anyway) and since that book has zombies in it I think the new dark style will suit it awesomely thank you very much.\n\nThe characters all look much older than they're supposed to be in Phoenix but it also kind of works in it's favour. They all look like they have a bit more history and life experience behind them, they're coping with stuff that will age any kid and it shows. That's also testament to the acting as well. Here mostly all the acting is pretty good, Ron Harry and Hermione all put in good efforts obviously having gotten the hang of the whole acting lark. Gambon is good as Dumbledore but I do miss Richard Harris and keep playing what might have been his versions of Gambons scenes over in my head. When I read the books it's Harris I'm picturing. Helena Bonham Carter gives a kooky insane kind of air to Bellatrix Lestrange (must get that from hubby Tim Burton) who was a pretty good character. One thing about this film though is that the actual Order of the Phoenix isn't in it all that much really. A flaw that wasn't in the book. The line about Snape being in the order, if you missed it you wouldn't even know he was in the order at all and a subsequent scene later on might seem confusing.\n\nKreacher was well done I though, coming across as a real miserable old bugger which was appropriate. The producers apparently weren't going to put him in the movie at all but JK Rowling said they'd be stuffing themselves up for the final movie if they did that.\n\nAll in all I think Phoenix is the best so far of the five movies, followed by Azkhaban, Goblet, then the other two in no particular order.\n\nNow I've just got hold of The Deathly Hallows and although it's quarter past five I'm off to bed so see you later....","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":534103,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2007-08-15","keywords":"friendship,argus filch character,abusive uncle,bullying,albus dumbledore character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192310553","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjUxOTJhODgtODk2Yy00NTBiLThlNjgtN2JhNTc1MWE0YmQxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Bros.

In Bennett Miller's dark and ominous Foxcatcher, the episode is framed as a true-life Faustian Tale. But the story is almost secondary to three outstanding dramatic performances -- two of which are given by men who are better known for their work in other genres.\n\nChanning Tatum stars as Olympic wrestler Mark Schultz. When we first meet him, he's already reached elite status by winning a gold medal. But the achievement hasn't allowed him to escape the shadow of his older brother, Dave, also a gold medalist. The younger Schultz wants more. He wants to be the best. His past prize also doesn't pay the bills. After training sessions, he's eating ramen noodles. All that changes, however, with a phone call from du Pont (Steve Carell) who offers to pay him and set him up in a first-class training facility on his Pennsylvania estate.\n\nLike Schultz, the multi-millionaire du Pont is a man in a seemingly enviable position who nevertheless wants something greater. He has family issues of his own, as he strives to please his disapproving mother (Vanessa Redgrave). He hopes he can make her proud by leading a team of wrestlers to gold in Seoul in 1988. But du Pont doesn't just want to be a benefactor. Even though he's little more than an extremely wealthy fan, with only a rudimentary knowledge of the sport, he wants to be seen as a coach and mentor to his wrestlers. And so, when Dave arrives to guide his brother, jealousy develops. Dave is everything du Pont wishes he could be, but isn't. He's a great teacher, a great leader. This leads to tension that slowly builds toward the story's shocking climax as du Pont's demons emerge.\n\nAs du Pont, Carell is almost unrecognizable beneath make-up and prosthetics. It's a quietly disturbing performance that will definitely have audiences and critics seeing the comic talent in a new light. Action/comedy star Tatum also has a breakthrough turn as the intense and driven young Schultz who grows increasingly uncomfortable under du Pont's subjugation. As a past Academy Award nominee, Mark Ruffalo's exceptional portrayal of the older Schultz comes as less of a surprise. But that doesn't make it any less notable or transformative. The normally wiry Ruffalo packed on a lot of muscle to play Dave Schultz. Here, he looks less like his Bruce Banner alter ego, and more like the Hulk himself. All three performances are a study in the art of subtly. This is a movie that derives drama from silent moments. In many key scenes, it's the words that aren't said that speak volumes.\n\nFoxcatcher features themes of control and manipulation, and wrestling functions as an apt metaphor. It's that most primal of sports – one in which you literally bend another person to your will. Ultimately though, the movie is a story about two people who reach for greatness, only to experience a great fall. And it's also the tale of a great man caught in the middle. The saddest part is that it actually happened.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138290,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-01-16","keywords":"domination,binging on junk food,wrestler,pennsylvania,upper class","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi230469145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Foxcatcher tells the fascinating true story of corruption and the struggle for power between Olympic gold medal-winning brothers and an eccentric millionaire."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587955/","name":"Bennett Miller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323215/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0754971/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296861/","name":"E.

He sets it in an era of fake news, fake history, disinformation. Propaganda at its best. Burn books and you can reinvent an alternative timeline.\n\nSet in a future Dystopia, Guy Montag (Michael P Jordan) and his mentor Captain Beatty (Michael Shannon) are firemen after a second civil war America who burn books, a tradition that goes far back as Benjamin Franklin! It is easier to control people if they could not find information and think for themselves. It was easy to keep people happy if they do not get offended from what they read.\n\nMontag carries out his work diligently and is in line for promotion but gets taken in by the Eels, a counter group who preserve the information contained in books. They learn books by heart, the upload it on the net, they rebel against the government.\n\nShannon can play the villain in his sleep.

He sets it in an era of fake news, fake history, disinformation. Propaganda at its best. Burn books and you can reinvent an alternative timeline.\n\nSet in a future Dystopia, Guy Montag (Michael P Jordan) and his mentor Captain Beatty (Michael Shannon) are firemen after a second civil war America who burn books, a tradition that goes far back as Benjamin Franklin! It is easier to control people if they could not find information and think for themselves. It was easy to keep people happy if they do not get offended from what they read.\n\nMontag carries out his work diligently and is in line for promotion but gets taken in by the Eels, a counter group who preserve the information contained in books. They learn books by heart, the upload it on the net, they rebel against the government.\n\nShannon can play the villain in his sleep. Jordan has the harder part but he is rather vacuous, maybe he is meant to be that way, a person who has never learned to think or question for himself.\n\nThere are some good ideas in this film but they never hang together or are fully realised.

This really took a step away from the everyday new generation comedy and did something a little different. This movie just felt like an action all the way, if that's what they were going for then bravo. Of course it had more drug use than most movies, but hey it's Seth Rogan, what did you expect.\n\nThe actions scenes were not only original, funny, and different, they were entertainingly brutal. This movie does have a lot of gore, but it is used in the best sense. As far as James Franco, I have never been a fan. I thought he was kind of over the top in Spiderman, I haven't really liked him in any other movies, but I loved him in this, in my own opinion he should stick to comedy.\n\nThe only reason I gave this a 7 out of 10 is because as I was writing this I more and more felt like it was one of those movies that will get old if you watch it too much. Don't get me wrong, I was highly entertained, but I don't think I want to see it TOO much.\n\nOverall though...Seth Rogan you've done it again.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":325371,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"stoner,marijuana,falling downhill,watching tv,man tied up","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pineapple Express: Theatrical trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2729574681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170550/","name":"Gary Cole"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0337773/","name":"David Gordon Green"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1698571/","name":"Evan Goldberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This really took a step away from the everyday new generation comedy and did something a little different. This movie just felt like an action all the way, if that's what they were going for then bravo. Of course it had more drug use than most movies, but hey it's Seth Rogan, what did you expect.\n\nThe actions scenes were not only original, funny, and different, they were entertainingly brutal. This movie does have a lot of gore, but it is used in the best sense. As far as James Franco, I have never been a fan. I thought he was kind of over the top in Spiderman, I haven't really liked him in any other movies, but I loved him in this, in my own opinion he should stick to comedy.\n\nThe only reason I gave this a 7 out of 10 is because as I was writing this I more and more felt like it was one of those movies that will get old if you watch it too much. Don't get me wrong, I was highly entertained, but I don't think I want to see it TOO much.\n\nOverall though...Seth Rogan you've done it again.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":325371,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"stoner,marijuana,falling downhill,watching tv,man tied up","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pineapple Express: Theatrical trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2729574681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170550/","name":"Gary Cole"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0337773/","name":"David Gordon Green"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1698571/","name":"Evan Goldberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.

Will it be "Edward Scissorhands" or "Batman II?"  With Burton you could get a quirky comedy, a dark thriller, or sweet morality tale.  And there's always the possibility of Danny DeVito chomping down on a raw fish.\n\n "Big Fish" combines Burton's unusual humor with a heart-wrenching story of a father-son deathbed reconciliation.  Albert Finney and Ewan McGregor share the role of Ed Bloom, one of the big fish from the movie's title while an SUV-sized catfish plays the other.  Bloom is a metaphorical and literal big fish in the small pond of Ashton, Alabama in this tale told mostly through flashback.  Jessica Lange plays his wife and Billy Crudup plays the son, Will, estranged from his father for the past three years.  Father and son are reunited as Finney lies dying of cancer.\n\n Ed Bloom has spent his life spinning his personal history into mythological proportions: an early encounter with a very tall man becomes a battle with a house-sized giant; a rural village is depicted as heaven on earth; military service during the Korean War morphs into a behind-the-lines mission that would make Duke Nukem proud.  Originally a true believer, Will now knows everything his father has told him was not just an exageration or even a tall tale but an outright lie.  In his effort to understand the truth behind his father's stories he learns to love the man as well as the mythology. And Burton delivers a terrific punchline at the end of the film that left me both tickled and weeping, a truly weird emotional state.\n\n Burton deals with mythic themes in "Big Fish."  Besides the surface story of the generational tension between father and son he explores the metaphor of the big-fish-in-a-small-pond by examining the impact Ed Bloom has had on the lives he's touched in his workaday contacts with colleagues, customers (he's a traveling salesman), and people in the small towns across the South. Not exactly "It's A Wonderful Life," he still manages to show how all of us -- even the little fish -- have profound effects on the people around us. And of course love -- unrequited and reciprocated -- control almost all of Ed's many adventures.\n\n The acting is wonderful.  You will actually believe two Brits and a Scot (Finney, Helena Bonham Carter, and McGregor) are natives of small town Alabama.  Lange brings dignity and brio to the role of the long "suffering" wife -- and she still looks great(!)-- you believe she has had a long and loving life with Finney/McGregor.  DeVito is a delight in the role of a circus ringmaster.  But the scene-stealer is Bonham Carter in the dual role of Jenny and the crone witch.\n\n I rated this movie ten stars and when you see it you'll do the same.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":426944,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-01-09","keywords":"storytelling,fish,father son relationship,death of father,flashback","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1493149209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2OTYzNzE3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDY0NTMzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A son tries to learn more about his dying father by reliving stories and myths he told about his life.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001215/","name":"Albert Finney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001082/","name":"Billy Crudup"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000318/","name":"Tim Burton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021095/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093750/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1180620/","name":"Daniel Wallace","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041864/","name":"John August"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After each episode I find myself shaking, often with tears in my eyes. I'm not going to talk about the story. I am going to tell you that the acting is beyond reproach. In almost every movie, every TV series, there are at least one or two characters that don't fit or are poorly portrayed. Not so here. I simply cannot find fault with the performances of the entire cast. Stellar! The sets, the direction, the camera work, the intensity all fit together seamlessly. This is a story of a good world...gone very wrong. This is a story about faith, twisted by evil intent, then thrust upon the common people. For me it is truly horrifying. I'm sorry I can't find better words to describe how this show affects me. I will say this: My daughter is currently attending university in the U.S. and I can tell you I fear for her safety every hour of every day. Not because this story is happening now...but because it is so close.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200987,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-04-26","keywords":"rape,dystopia,violence against women,slavery,torture","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005253/","name":"Elisabeth Moss","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2088803/","name":"Yvonne Strahovski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001212/","name":"Joseph Fiennes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0071026/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108881/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0588005/","name":"Bruce Miller"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2726412313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljMGNkYTMtMzE3MS00ZjM2LThjY2ItM2Q5YTVhYmI0ZmEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTljMGNkYTMtMzE3MS00ZjM2LThjY2ItM2Q5YTVhYmI0ZmEzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"Freedom is just the beginning.

The screwball comedy between the hero and heroine is very well done; adults can appreciate that. The sidekicks, in particular the Max and Pascal, are hilarious. The hero and heroine are very likable and not flat. And there's a sense of sadness/wistfulness throughout the whole show that the adults will understand.\n\nBut what really is great is the animation. This is Pixar-worthy great. In fact, after a while I forgot it was CGI (which tends to be a bit stiff and crude when it comes to character animation). The human characters have that hand-drawn quality even though they're CG. In fact, they're more expressive than the hand-drawn characters in Princess and the Frog. The backgrounds are gorgeous (I can count every blade of grass). And there's an iconic scene where the kingdom rouses from darkness to light with thousands of floating lanterns -- it really is magical. It reminds me of classics such as Beauty and the Beast and Sleeping Beauty.\n\nBest of all, the movie is not just all laughs and slapstick. It has heart too. Even the minor characters such as the King and Queen -- you can feel the emotions. And the romance is believable and not cheesy.\n\nLike I said, I was very pleasantly surprised. It's something that is worthy of Pixar, and I'm glad to see Disney back on their game.

One of the best of the decade","reviewBody":"Revolutionary Road is not a very joyful film, or is it easy to watch. Instead of being simply entertaining, it achieves what not many films these days do. It wants to be a learning lesson.\n\nThis film is superbly crafted, in both the writing and the amazing direction by Sam Mendes. After his great film 'American Beauty', he comes back with strong will to do this project. His direction is the best of the year for sure. It feels so professional, so alive. The writing, both of the characters, Frank and April Wheeler, I feel they are so open and 3-dimensional characters, but the screenplay wants to let us inside their lives, and it does so with great passion. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Frank with such intensity, with such force. Dicaprio gives his best performance here without a doubt, since I don't really think he has ever done something like this before. Then there is Kate Winslet. My favorite actress, and certainly one of the most talented out there. Winslet has surprised me before in a lot of movies, but here, she surprises me in a whole other way. Her silent, unlikeable, and sometimes human and cold portrayal of April Wheeler is one of the best performances of the decade. She gives the best female performance of the year, and I truly hope she finally wins the Oscar she deserves.\n\nThe film itself is so beautiful, so alive, yet at the same time, so dark to what the film is about. The cinematography is amazing, as well as the costumes and the whole set designs. The music, the original score, was so unsettling, perfectly balanced to what each scene brought.\n\nRevolutionary Road is not a film for everyone. I can definitely see some critics will hate it, but it should certainly be respected, for its ambition, for the things it accomplishes and every thing it portrays. I think this is Mendes' masterpiece. I have not seen a better made film this year."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":204611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-02-25","keywords":"unhappy love,hearing aid,street in title,sex scene,sex in car","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Revolutionary Road: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4269277209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2ODc2MzI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM0MDg5MQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2ODc2MzI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM0MDg5MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Revolutionary Road, directed by Sam Mendes and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0280199/","name":"Christopher Fitzgerald"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005222/","name":"Sam Mendes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0200982/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1244808/","name":"Justin Haythe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0946817/","name":"Richard Yates"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

One of the best of the decade","reviewBody":"Revolutionary Road is not a very joyful film, or is it easy to watch. Instead of being simply entertaining, it achieves what not many films these days do. It wants to be a learning lesson.\n\nThis film is superbly crafted, in both the writing and the amazing direction by Sam Mendes. After his great film 'American Beauty', he comes back with strong will to do this project. His direction is the best of the year for sure. It feels so professional, so alive. The writing, both of the characters, Frank and April Wheeler, I feel they are so open and 3-dimensional characters, but the screenplay wants to let us inside their lives, and it does so with great passion. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Frank with such intensity, with such force. Dicaprio gives his best performance here without a doubt, since I don't really think he has ever done something like this before. Then there is Kate Winslet. My favorite actress, and certainly one of the most talented out there. Winslet has surprised me before in a lot of movies, but here, she surprises me in a whole other way. Her silent, unlikeable, and sometimes human and cold portrayal of April Wheeler is one of the best performances of the decade. She gives the best female performance of the year, and I truly hope she finally wins the Oscar she deserves.\n\nThe film itself is so beautiful, so alive, yet at the same time, so dark to what the film is about. The cinematography is amazing, as well as the costumes and the whole set designs. The music, the original score, was so unsettling, perfectly balanced to what each scene brought.\n\nRevolutionary Road is not a film for everyone. I can definitely see some critics will hate it, but it should certainly be respected, for its ambition, for the things it accomplishes and every thing it portrays. I think this is Mendes' masterpiece. I have not seen a better made film this year.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":204611,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2009-02-25","keywords":"unhappy love,hearing aid,street in title,sex scene,sex in car","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Revolutionary Road: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4269277209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2ODc2MzI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM0MDg5MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg2ODc2MzI3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM0MDg5MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for Revolutionary Road, directed by Sam Mendes and starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0280199/","name":"Christopher Fitzgerald"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005222/","name":"Sam Mendes"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0200982/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1244808/","name":"Justin Haythe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0946817/","name":"Richard Yates"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Rooster is hired by a very plucky 14 year old girl, Mattie Ross (debuting Hailee Steinfeld), who wants to avenge her father. Dad was murdered by the cowardly Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), who made out for Indian territory and who may now be riding with an outlaw, Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper), and his gang. They are joined by a determined Texas Ranger, LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), who wants to arrest Chaney for a crime committed in the Lone Star state.\n\nThis new version of the Charles Portis novel was scripted and directed by the great filmmaking brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, who treat the material respectfully, even reverently. The dialogue is antiquated, yet quite literate, and it truly comes to life when spoken by this well-chosen cast. The story is straightforward and without filler, the pacing very efficient. Serious at times (and funny at other times), the film never veers too far into melodrama. It hits the ground running, with an older Mattie (Elizabeth Marvel) narrating and giving us the back story of Mr. Ross' killing. Two frequent Coen brothers collaborators work some real magic: cinematographer Roger Deakins, whose widescreen compositions are wonderful, and composer Carter Burwell, whose music is breathtaking.\n\nBridges completely disappears inside the role of the surly, tough, hard drinking marshal, while Damon gives one of his better performances. Brolin and Pepper don't show up until around the 80 minute mark, but do extremely effective work. As soon as you meet Chaney, you know you loathe him; he's that much of a heel. The strong supporting cast includes Dakin Matthews, Paul Rae, Domhnall Gleeson, and Leon Russom; it's also great to see Jarlath Conroy from George Romeros' "Day of the Dead" as the undertaker. But young Steinfeld leaves the greatest impression, giving us a heroine who is capable, determined, and very mature for her age, a girl who can hold her own dealing with a character like Stonehill (Matthews).\n\n"True Grit" 2010 is sometimes violent (and strikingly so), but is basically just a good, solid example of impassioned storytelling that maintains viewer interest for the better part of two hours.\n\nEight out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":322825,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Western"],"datePublished":"2011-02-23","keywords":"revisionist western,reference to new mexico,death by hanging,long drop hanging,spanking threat","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Grit: "Click" TV Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1984862489","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDM1NTAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI1NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5NDM1NTAxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI1NTYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"True Grit: "Click" TV Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000313/","name":"Jeff Bridges"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2794962/","name":"Hailee Steinfeld"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0692427/","name":"Charles Portis"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make. They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice. Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.\n\n2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music. In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie &amp; Julia and Philomena.\n\nI cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.) Something that was different with the 94 version.\n\nIt is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164531,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-25","keywords":"aspiring writer,poverty,women's rights,mother daughter relationship,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2655304729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer-director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) has crafted a Little Women that draws on both the classic novel and the writings of Louisa May Alcott, and unfolds as the author’s alter ego, Jo March, reflects back and forth on her fictional life."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6073955/","name":"Florence Pugh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0532247/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017301/","name":"Louisa May Alcott"}],"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie &amp; Julia and Philomena.\n\nI cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.) Something that was different with the 94 version.\n\nIt is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164531,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-25","keywords":"aspiring writer,poverty,women's rights,mother daughter relationship,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2655304729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer-director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) has crafted a Little Women that draws on both the classic novel and the writings of Louisa May Alcott, and unfolds as the author’s alter ego, Jo March, reflects back and forth on her fictional life.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6073955/","name":"Florence Pugh"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0532247/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017301/","name":"Louisa May Alcott"],"duration":"PT2H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They are really good at what they do. These guys set the bar for quality animated movies. Back then, animated movies were pretty much made for kids only. They were just your usual Sunday morning cartoons. Large eyeballs, goofy voice, exaggerated slapsticks. Disney had its classics like Bambi, Fox and The Hound, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty. However, it felt more like fairy tales. Bedtime stories your parents give as they tuck you in. In this day and age, it wouldn't work that well.

And Pixar has been doing just this ever since.\n\nThough the movies they released were still a quality entertainment, I haven't felt like this since Toy Story 3. Toy Story 3 made me bawl like a baby. And their newest feature film, Coco, finally made me weep like a baby again. Coco is a heart-warming experience, filled with outstanding animation, wonderful music, brilliant writing, and creative models which brings out the best of Mexican culture. The movie took on themes like family, aspirations, and music. And they merged it marvelously with the Day of the Dead culture in Mexico. I also feel that this movie sends a strong message towards those that had lost their loved ones at some point. The way this movie talks about possessions and the inevitable loss that comes will, I hope, comfort you.\n\nCoco is a great movie. Definitely the best animated movie this year (The Emoji Movie? Yeah, don't think so). Could possibly be a nominee for Best Picture this year. The way it tugs our heartstrings and the emotionally satisfying end will definitely please everyone. And it's definitely up there among Pixar's finest. If Justice League annoys you, just see this movie. I definitely recommend you. Bring your families, kids to grandparents, whoever you like.

Didn't expected much cause I really liked 94 version by Gillian Armstrong with Winona Ryder , Gabriel Byrne , Trini Alvarado , Christian Bale and Susan Sarandon. Well, the casting was something that I cannot judge which one is better. Both are so so great. But Christian Bale 94, I liked better than Timothée Chalamet 2019 (Although he was good but didn't overcome THE Christian).\n\nTwo things really grabbed me.\n\n1. The camera and light. The camera is keep moving even for the steady shots. They released the tripod and moved a little to adjust each actors even a small movement they make. They also use sunlight so beautifully like Pride and Prejudice. Aldo a couple of slow motions and mintage sequences are beautiful too.\n\n2. The music. It is not like here I am listen like Hans Zimmer or Max Richter or even Cliff Martinez who would say even if the movie suck I am still here. Think that at least you've watched a great Music Video cause of my music. In this movie the music is there clearly and when it comes to really important moments, It really boost up the heart of audience. But it's more like supporting way. I felt it from the very beginning. Ok wow this guy knows OST!! Alexandre is more of a classic composer who made OST like The Danish Girl, The Tree of life, Julie &amp; Julia and Philomena.\n\nI cannot say this movie will win (was nominated for 6 Academy) a lot of awards from all around the world but it has beautiful beautiful acting ensenble and light, camera and music wise. Work of art.\n\nAlso the acting sometimes made my heart beat. Even the makeup is so great. Of course the director is also an actress so she knows how to deal with these stuff, right?\n\nLast. The time. It goes back and forth from the past to present a couple of times but it was not confusing or breaking any concentration cause it was so nicely connected by editing and bridge music. (The cast y-oung and old -was the same too which didn't matter as well.) Something that was different with the 94 version.\n\nIt is an inspiring movie after all and I won't rest tonight to finish my humble feature writing for my next project.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164531,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-25","keywords":"aspiring writer,poverty,women's rights,mother daughter relationship,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2655304729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjNGY4M2ItNDhmMS00ZTVlLWEyN2EtOWRlNGZkYzMwOTBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer-director Greta Gerwig (Lady Bird) has crafted a Little Women that draws on both the classic novel and the writings of Louisa May Alcott, and unfolds as the author’s alter ego, Jo March, reflects back and forth on her fictional life."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519680/","name":"Saoirse Ronan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6073955/","name":"Florence Pugh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0532247/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1950086/","name":"Greta Gerwig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0017301/","name":"Louisa May Alcott"}],"duration":"PT2H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Paranormal-themed films are getting to be quite stale, but the ending, which actually has two twists, is marvellous and might - might - galvanise the genre. \n\nSigourney Weaver and Cillian (pronounced 'Kill-ian') Murphy play Doctors Matheson and Buckley. They're a psychologist and physicist who investigate psychic claims. Invariably they come away from each case laughing. Every one is explained scientifically; rationally. They're exposed as magic tricks. \n\nRecent roles haven't reflected why Weaver, who is nearly 65, has been so prolific of late, but here she excels. Her character is meant to be an expert and, because of the plausibility she exudes, that's exactly how I viewed her. Writer-director Rodrigo Cortes' ('Buried') excellent script assists her characterisation. Intellectual, detailed, life-like: you could be mistaken, at moments, for watching a TV show debate. Murphy gets similar credit. He invests in his role a seriousness which might have been silly if he did so in isolation. \n\nThe doctors find their match in Simon Silver (Robert De Niro), a famous psychic who comes out of retirement for one last pay check. He's the only one Weaver won't investigate because 'he's the only one who makes her doubt'. Murphy insists, however, but when he does, he – we – uncover more than we were expecting. \n\nLike you (I hope), I'm convinced that psychic ability is balderdash. So I was more than impressed at how Cortes creates a mood and a tempo that keeps you guessing until the dramatic end. His film is original, suspenseful and, most importantly for a film with this premise, credible. \n\nBut then there's De Niro, my favourite actor. Always has been. Always will be. But my God has he been making it hard for me these past 20 years. He once said that he was an actor, not a personality. I think it's time for him to update his personal quote book. Why do I say this? Because (and I deeply regret admitting this) he's the single biggest reason why 'Red Lights', regardless of Weaver's and Murphy's endeavours and the superb final twist, will join his expanding cannon of fodder.\n\nwww.moseleyb13.com","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60024,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2012-03-02","keywords":"psychic,revelation,obsession,younger version of character,road trip","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3842417177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ4NzcyNTYwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc5ODg4MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ4NzcyNTYwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc5ODg4MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Psychologist Margaret Matheson and her assistant study paranormal activity, which leads them to investigate a world-renowned psychic who has resurfaced years after his toughest critic mysteriously passed away.

I won't go too in depth into the differences between the book and the movie. Some characters were cut, some stories were shortened and rearranged, and the ending is somewhat less dark. However, I would say that all of these changes are understandable when making a two hour movie. The soul of the book is still there though. If you liked the book, you will like the movie. The directing and acting are great, and I have zero complaints in this department.\n\nI do have a few complaints, starting with some parts of the plot seem like they would be hard to follow if you haven't read the book. There were segments of the story that would have benefited from a little more time spent on them for clarity. I am a fan of long movies, and understand that a lot of people are not, but I think an extra 15 minutes could have made a big difference.\n\nThe narration seems to be a sore subject among the other reviews I've read, and I have to say I have mixed feelings. I like the idea of narration in a book-turned-movie. There's a certain amount of context and motive behind characters' actions that can get glossed over in a movie if there's no narration, but it was too inconsistent in this case. It either needed more narration, or it needed to be limited to just the intro and outro.\n\nI think the major issue with the movie is that people are focusing on the wrong parts of it. Everyone wants to talk about the blunt sexual content, and the excessive use of technology in the movie. To me, those are the things that make it a realistic story. Perhaps that's just because I'm in my twenties, and blunt sexual content and excessive technology use are a large percentage of my life. People call this a movie about how technology is ruining and/or changing relationships. I disagree. This movie is about growing up, relationships, and miscommunication. Affairs aren't new. Questionable parenting isn't new. Body image issues aren't new. Sexual frustration isn't new. Depression isn't new.

I won't go too in depth into the differences between the book and the movie. Some characters were cut, some stories were shortened and rearranged, and the ending is somewhat less dark. However, I would say that all of these changes are understandable when making a two hour movie. The soul of the book is still there though. If you liked the book, you will like the movie. The directing and acting are great, and I have zero complaints in this department.\n\nI do have a few complaints, starting with some parts of the plot seem like they would be hard to follow if you haven't read the book. There were segments of the story that would have benefited from a little more time spent on them for clarity. I am a fan of long movies, and understand that a lot of people are not, but I think an extra 15 minutes could have made a big difference.\n\nThe narration seems to be a sore subject among the other reviews I've read, and I have to say I have mixed feelings. I like the idea of narration in a book-turned-movie. There's a certain amount of context and motive behind characters' actions that can get glossed over in a movie if there's no narration, but it was too inconsistent in this case. It either needed more narration, or it needed to be limited to just the intro and outro.\n\nI think the major issue with the movie is that people are focusing on the wrong parts of it. Everyone wants to talk about the blunt sexual content, and the excessive use of technology in the movie. To me, those are the things that make it a realistic story. Perhaps that's just because I'm in my twenties, and blunt sexual content and excessive technology use are a large percentage of my life. People call this a movie about how technology is ruining and/or changing relationships. I disagree. This movie is about growing up, relationships, and miscommunication. Affairs aren't new. Questionable parenting isn't new. Body image issues aren't new. Sexual frustration isn't new. Depression isn't new. The movie shows technology not as a cause or effect of any of these things, but as being intertwined with them the exact way technology is intertwined with modern life. People are looking to MWC as a comment on technology in modern life, and finding it wishy- washy. But that's because it's not taking any sides, it's just showing how things are.\n\nIf you go in to this movie expecting an interesting story, rather than an editorial about technology, you'll probably enjoy it.

It's worth owning.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":143008,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1983-06-08","keywords":"role reversal,class differences,scam,suicide attempt,stock market","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi683391513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRlOGVjYTctOWZkNy00ZmIwLWJlNTgtNWY1N2YxOWRmYWFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRlOGVjYTctOWZkNy00ZmIwLWJlNTgtNWY1N2YxOWRmYWFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000552/","name":"Eddie Murphy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000101/","name":"Dan Aykroyd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000897/","name":"Ralph Bellamy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000484/","name":"John Landis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048902/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0365390/","name":"Timothy Harris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0918339/","name":"Herschel Weingrod"],"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1905493,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1994-10-14","keywords":"nonlinear timeline,overdose,drug overdose,drug use,bondage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2620371481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MzgxMTQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjczMTk0NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MzgxMTQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjczMTk0NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000235/","name":"Uma Thurman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

Obviously times move on, and I acknowledge that due to its violence and one particularly uncomfortable scene this film is not for everyone, but I still remember watching it for the first time, and it blew me away. Anyone who watches it now has to remember that it actually changed the history of cinema. In context- it followed a decade or more of action films that always ended with a chase sequence where the hero saved the day - you could have written those films yourself. Pulp had you gripped and credited the audience with intelligence. There is not a line of wasted dialogue and the movie incorporates a number of complexities that are not immediately obvious. It also resurrected the career of Grease icon John Travolta and highlighted the acting talent of Samuel L Jackson. There are many films now that are edited out of sequence and have multiple plots etc but this is the one they all want to be, or all want to beat, but never will.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1905493,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1994-10-14","keywords":"nonlinear timeline,overdose,drug overdose,drug use,bondage","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2620371481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MzgxMTQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjczMTk0NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5MzgxMTQ4M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjczMTk0NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000235/","name":"Uma Thurman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

I saw it again, as I have repeatedly for years, and still laughed. My new son had never seen it before and liked it as well. Murphy was at the top of his game back then and Aykroyd is the perfect snob-class elitist. Some of these jokes are so timeless that I still refer to them from time-to-time and they STILL get laughs, both from people who have and haven't seen this film.\n\nYes, the jokes are a bit dated and somewhat slapstick, but this was a sign of the times.

So is his movie. But by no means, is Zoolander humorless. Directed by and starring Ben Stiller, Zoolander is a very funny movie, if you know what to expect. Based on a character that Stiller created for the 1996 VH1 Fashion Awards, Derek Zoolander was originally intended to satirize the fashion industry. The movie does no less and as a result, has received some very negative patron reviews. Audiences went into Zoolander expecting another Ben Stiller, Meet the Parents-type comedy, and when they got an offbeat movie about the fashion industry's plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia, they didn't know how to react. To enjoy Zoolander, one has to forget all expectations and see the movie for what it is supposed to be: ridiculous.\n\nDerek Zoolander (Stiller) is the fashion industry's number one male model, but his career is slouching and boy beauty Hansel (Owen Wilson) provides tough competition. Fashion designer Mugatu (Will Ferrell) takes advantage of this and Zoolander's stupidity, and brainwashes him to kill the Malaysian prime minister, after he put an end to vital fashion industry sweatshops. The talented cast and an excellent soundtrack add absurdity to the already farcical plot. Zoolander gives both Ferrell and Wilson the opportunity to do what they do best. For Saturday Night Live's Ferrell that is embracing and developing the demented, while for Meet the Parents' Wilson, it is the chance to play a comedic, confident, character role. Stiller's father and wife also appear in supporting roles, with Jerry Stiller as Maury Ballstein, Derek's agent, and Christine Taylor as Matilda Jeffries, a TIME magazine reporter. Jerry Stiller, like Wilson, always manages to find humor in every role he plays, and in Zoolander this remains especially true. Taylor, being a veteran of the Brady Bunch movies, is not stranger to satire either. Well-chosen and placed music adds laughs and heightens the tone and feel of the movie. With songs ranging from Wham!'s `Wake Me Up Before You Go Go' playing as cruising music for Derek and his male model friends, and Michael Jackson's `Beat It' as the background music for a face-off between Derek and Hansel, any remaining seriousness is diminished. And yet even more surprise and absurdity is added by the many unexpected cast members and cameo appearances. Others appearing in Zoolander include David Duchovny, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Andy Dick, David Bowie, Cuba Gooding Jr., Winona Ryder, and even Ralph Lauren's own male model, Tyson Beckford. I can understand people disliking this movie; it is temperamental. This is the kind of movie that varies depending on the audience and a person's expectation. Generally though, if you keep an open mind and realize that it is not meant to be serious in any way, your view of the movie shouldn't go anywhere but up. Zoolander is absurd, ridiculous, and overall, an incredibly stupid movie. I suggest you see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253720,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-02-27","keywords":"male model,fashion model,conspiracy,fashion,malaysia","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852132/","name":"Christine Taylor"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045189/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0766153/","name":"Drake Sather"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357453/","name":"John Hamburg"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Jerry Stiller, like Wilson, always manages to find humor in every role he plays, and in Zoolander this remains especially true. Taylor, being a veteran of the Brady Bunch movies, is not stranger to satire either. Well-chosen and placed music adds laughs and heightens the tone and feel of the movie. With songs ranging from Wham!'s `Wake Me Up Before You Go Go' playing as cruising music for Derek and his male model friends, and Michael Jackson's `Beat It' as the background music for a face-off between Derek and Hansel, any remaining seriousness is diminished. And yet even more surprise and absurdity is added by the many unexpected cast members and cameo appearances. Others appearing in Zoolander include David Duchovny, Jon Voight, Vince Vaughn, Andy Dick, David Bowie, Cuba Gooding Jr., Winona Ryder, and even Ralph Lauren's own male model, Tyson Beckford. I can understand people disliking this movie; it is temperamental. This is the kind of movie that varies depending on the audience and a person's expectation. Generally though, if you keep an open mind and realize that it is not meant to be serious in any way, your view of the movie shouldn't go anywhere but up. Zoolander is absurd, ridiculous, and overall, an incredibly stupid movie. I suggest you see it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253720,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-02-27","keywords":"male model,fashion model,conspiracy,fashion,malaysia","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852132/","name":"Christine Taylor"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045189/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0766153/","name":"Drake Sather","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357453/","name":"John Hamburg"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The styling and make-up is so on point. But even more impressive is her wicked accent. It was, hands down, the funniest aspect of the film. Every time she opened her mouth I died.

The cameo performances were a delight in the original and that has managed to follow through effortlessly. More cameo's that are more irreverent and more outrageous than before. The cameos at the end are truly worth while. The few in the beginning are forgettable. The actors conviction.

But they save him from being despised by allowing the audience to laugh at him. Allowing us to point our fingers at his ridiculous face and laugh till the tears run. But that playground fun time is now over, forced to laugh with him. There's very few sidebar comments that grab our attention and remind us, 'Oh, Zoolander is a douche', not just an idiot.\n\nOther than that Zoolander 2 is a totally run-of-the-mill comedy, nothing too special or outrages, nothing too memorable our outstanding.

The movie hinges on this character so if it was not done with great integrity and clarity and humor --it would not work. Ms. Anniston actually looks like a person and not terribly attractive at that --not a movie star in any way. Which is crucial to entering into this story. The supporting characters particularly her "maid" who is absolutely wonderful and integral to the story are mostly well drawn. It is not a movie that to entertain in the light vein (needless to say) but it is well worth watching for this compelling story of a woman in many kinds of pain and how she begins to overcome that overwhelming pain.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36268,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-01-23","keywords":"chronic pain,loss of wife,drug addiction,suicide,sex with a gardener","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2170335001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwNjkyMjkwODdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDgyMTc4NTMx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwNjkyMjkwODdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDgyMTc4NTMx._V1_.jpg","description":"Claire becomes fascinated by the suicide of a woman in her chronic pain support group.

The movie hinges on this character so if it was not done with great integrity and clarity and humor --it would not work. Ms. Anniston actually looks like a person and not terribly attractive at that --not a movie star in any way. Which is crucial to entering into this story. The supporting characters particularly her "maid" who is absolutely wonderful and integral to the story are mostly well drawn. It is not a movie that to entertain in the light vein (needless to say) but it is well worth watching for this compelling story of a woman in many kinds of pain and how she begins to overcome that overwhelming pain.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36268,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-01-23","keywords":"chronic pain,loss of wife,drug addiction,suicide,sex with a gardener","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2170335001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwNjkyMjkwODdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDgyMTc4NTMx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTEwNjkyMjkwODdeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDgyMTc4NTMx._V1_.jpg","description":"Claire becomes fascinated by the suicide of a woman in her chronic pain support group.

I don't know why NBC is trying to kill this show by making its audience go somewhere else for entertainment.\n\nEither way, the show is great, the stories are hella weird and this show is out there, along with American Horror Stories, the only two shows I'm currently watching on TV.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":112471,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2011-10-28","keywords":"male protagonist,occult detective,supernatural power,psychotronic series,detective","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1365912/","name":"David Giuntoli","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0395203/","name":"Russell Hornsby","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593734/","name":"Silas Weir Mitchell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0250594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147414/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0139461/","name":"Stephen Carpenter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0339264/","name":"David Greenwalt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0467942/","name":"Jim Kouf"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Grimm: Season 5","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3012080409","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWI1NTU1OWMtM2U3Yi00ZTY0LWI3YzEtZmMwOTRiN2M3ZmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWI1NTU1OWMtM2U3Yi00ZTY0LWI3YzEtZmMwOTRiN2M3ZmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Season 5 promo"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It probably has contained some of the best and definitely a lot of the worst Trek episodes ever. It was meant to re-invent Trek but all it did was re-use old plot devices. The best thing they ever did was replace Berman, because he had been working on the franchise too long. Trek needs new blood, and for the 4th season they finally got it.

Most of the time though, their output is rarely above mediocre and even often terrible, the worst without any redeeming qualities. Yet there is something compulsive about their relatively consistent badness, speaking as somebody who does not actually mind low-budget and can get enjoyment out of this kind of story, as long as some kind of effort is obvious.\n\n'Monster Island', starting off on a kind note or at least an attempt an honest attempt of a kind note if it doesn't come over that year, is not one of The Asylum's worst. Nowhere near, although there is hardly anything good in 'Monster Island' to me (did have to look hard for them too) it isn't completely irredeemable like their worst efforts are. This is from personal perspective of course. Still found it monstrously bad, the flaws are many, almost every other way, and they are not small, huge actually. Saying this with regret not malice, and there is much more to the problem than being derivative.\n\nIts least bad asset is the production design, the one asset where effort was obvious. Though this is only marginally so rather than significantly so. A particularly good job was done with the caves as has been said already. Some of the photography was okay.\n\nElsewhere, the production values were really poorly done and that the film was made on the cheap is obvious. It looks pretty drab, but it's the disorganised looking editing and last minute looking visual effects, that would even look out of date in the 50s, that come off worst. The submarine is used poorly and there is nothing authentic about it, it didn't look like a submarine and looked like it was filmed in a tank. What can be remembered of the music has very little presence and the film might as better well not had music at all because it didn't fit, added nothing and wouldn't have sounded appealing on its own.\n\nWas expecting little from the script, and it turned out to be worse than expected with the cheese and awkwardness too frequently being rather hard to take. Predictability was hardly unexpected and would have tolerated it, providing that there was some degree of fun and suspense. Unfortunately, 'Monster Island' completely failed to be fun, even on a guilty pleasure level, and the stupidity became intelligence-insulting and exhausting after a while. The suspense was also absent and the whole film felt dreary. The monster action is limited, or at least what the underused creatures are given to do. What there was leaves one confused, bored and shouting at the screen in frustration and the creatures have little personality let alone menace or soul.\n\nGot the sense that the director Mark Atkins had little plan of how to direct or structure 'Monster Island' or what to do with it or that his heart was barely in it. The characters were neither interesting or worth rooting for, there is so little to them in personality or development, their nonsensical decision making is both frustrating and disreacting and how they're written has been seen before many times. The acting is poor at best, the biggest name being Eric Roberts who acts like a sleepwalking robot.\n\nConcluding, very bad. 2/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":582,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.6},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-06-01","keywords":"sea monster,helicopter,submarine,psychotronic film,underwater scene","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3779051289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MGVhZTktZGEwYy00NWEyLTg4MjgtYThkMDk2NzQ0N2Q5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDE2MGVhZTktZGEwYy00NWEyLTg4MjgtYThkMDk2NzQ0N2Q5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000616/","name":"Eric Roberts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0865084/","name":"Toshi Toda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345685/","name":"Adrian Bouchet"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0040630/","name":"Mark Atkins"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042909/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0040630/","name":"Mark Atkins"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is the movie for you!!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8158,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-05-27","keywords":"title directed by female,obedience,security guard,punishment,f rated","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3353780/","name":"Katie Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4955588/","name":"Celina Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3048050/","name":"Sara Canning"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0261629/","name":"Danishka Esterhazy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0128500/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0261629/","name":"Danishka Esterhazy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1086155/","name":"Katharine Montagu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0160942/","name":"Ken Chubb"],"duration":"PT1H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Also.. the characters in this show are Stupid... and I do mean stupid with a capital S... characters. Seriously... Nobody is this clueless. \n\nThe entire theory of the show seems to be that the bad guys are bad guys because everyone on the planet is so dumb that they haven't noticed the idiotic stunts they've pulled. The show also seems bent on portraying the kids as mentally challenged too. Sure one of them has some tech savvy but, seriously... some of the 'mistakes' they made are 3rd grader nonsense, not high school. \n\nNot believable at all. And I'm pretty forgiving of most marvel titles. I've liked a lot of them just fine. This one is just... awful.\n\nNot sure how the critics are rating this so high. It's absolutely NOT that great a show... it's not even that good a show... it's borderline awful. \n\nWatch it if you have some time to kill and nothing else decent is on... that's about the only advice I can give.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":23815,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-11-21","keywords":"shared universe,superheroine,teenager,super villain,marvel cinematic universe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7968341/","name":"Rhenzy Feliz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4555391/","name":"Lyrica Okano","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4722966/","name":"Virginia Gardner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0213225/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0218858/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1335634/","name":"Stephanie Savage","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0777300/","name":"Josh Schwartz"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 3 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3938893593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk4NDA0OGMtNGI2Yi00OWQyLWEzYjMtZmJiOWNkZDViNzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODk4NDA0OGMtNGI2Yi00OWQyLWEzYjMtZmJiOWNkZDViNzY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Season 3, the Runaways frantically search for their captured friends Chase, Gert, and Karolina.

It probably has contained some of the best and definitely a lot of the worst Trek episodes ever. It was meant to re-invent Trek but all it did was re-use old plot devices. The best thing they ever did was replace Berman, because he had been working on the franchise too long. Trek needs new blood, and for the 4th season they finally got it. But of course it came too late and now the show has been cancelled after it just started to find its footing.\n\nContrary to some other comments I've seen, Enterprise did NOT use its cast to its fullest potential. Mayweather has been virtually ignored since the first and second seasons (he wasn't even in most of the 3rd season episodes) and when he has been around lately it has only been to lift heavy things or hit something.
