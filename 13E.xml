Sort of - and with a lot of different individuals and characters to keep us occupied. Many scenes and a lot of German (original language of the movie is polish) being spoken too. Which makes sense of course and I didn't mind, understanding it all.\n\nStories are decent enough and you will care about most people/individuals overall.

Their magic is still in evidence in their latest film, Young Ahmed, which won them the award for Best Director this year at Cannes. While it is a small film on a very big subject - that of Islamic fundamentalism - the film manages to deliver a thought-provoking and involving experience in spite of its 84-minute length and the broad scope of its subject.\n\nSet in a small town in Belgium, a country that has endured recent terrorist attacks, the film belongs to first-time actor Idir Ben Addi who delivers a remarkable performance as Ahmed, a studious-looking, bespectacled 13-year-old boy whose hangdog appearance and inarticulateness masks his devotion to a fundamentalist religious philosophy that takes no prisoners. With his youth and malleability, his growing adherence to what he considers to be a true Muslim is fostered by his relationship with a local imam, Youssouf (Othmane Moumen, "Bad Buzz") who rails at what he considers to be the growing secular attack on Islam.\n\nWithout a father in the home to guide him, Ahmed personifies those whose obsession with ideology blinds them to their own humanity and that of others, taking on the imam's "us versus them" attitude even when it comes to his family. He calls his sister a "slut" because of the casual way she dresses and berates his mother (Claire Bodson, "Our Children") for drinking wine and not wearing a hijab. Apparently, Ahmed's transformation is recent since his mother laments the fact that just last year all he thought about were video games, but we do not know what triggered Ahmed's transformation and the film does not pursue it.\n\nWe do know, however, that he is burdened by the memory of his cousin who apparently took his own life as a suicide bomber, a fact that the imam will not let him forget. The teenager's main source of conflict is with his teacher Inès (Myriem Akheddiou, "The Kid with a Bike"). He refuses to shake her hand because he thinks women are impure and because she is dating a person of the Jewish faith. He is also upset about her plans to use music to teach Arabic and the Quran, plans that he considers sacrilegious. Labeled by the imam as an apostate, the impressionable teenager tries to prove his faith by physically assaulting her, an action for which he is placed in juvenile custody. Even this is too much for the imam who tells Ahmed that he said to oppose her beliefs, not try to kill her.\n\nAt the juvenile facility, Ahmed is treated with respect by his caseworker, psychologist, and teachers, but the viewer is left probing for clues as to whether Ahmed regrets his actions and is willing to change or whether he is quietly planning another assault. As part of his rehabilitation, he is sent to a farm where he is befriended by Louise (Victoria Bluck), the young daughter at the farm, but even her kiss does not awaken in him a feeling for people who have a different outlook on life. While Young Ahmed centers on the fundamentalist tenets of one religion, the film is not an attack on Islam but an assertion that any idea which considers itself to be the only true belief is antithetical to long-established ideals of tolerance and religious freedom.\n\nUltimately, no words or actions of others seem to reach Ahmed. As director Jean-Pierre Dardenne put it, "Fanatics don't listen to the outside world; they build a wall between themselves and the world. Their only goal is for others to become like them, no matter the cost." Though the direction in which Ahmed is headed is unclear, it is in the moment when his body deserts him that we get a hint he knows that his only escape from the bondage of ideology is to discover the true nature of his own being and that his only loss will be that which has stood in the way of his deeper understanding of the world.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3761,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-05-22","keywords":"classroom,muslim,imam,teacher,mother son relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi452115481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RiNjYyN2MtNTdhOC00MmQxLWIwYmItNzE1YjkyMjkxYTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RiNjYyN2MtNTdhOC00MmQxLWIwYmItNzE1YjkyMjkxYTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10712072/","name":"Idir Ben Addi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5672971/","name":"Olivier Bonnaud"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4159235/","name":"Myriem Akheddiou"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201094/","name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201095/","name":"Luc Dardenne"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075922/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0016569/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201094/","name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201095/","name":"Luc Dardenne"}],"duration":"PT1H25M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He calls his sister a "slut" because of the casual way she dresses and berates his mother (Claire Bodson, "Our Children") for drinking wine and not wearing a hijab. Apparently, Ahmed's transformation is recent since his mother laments the fact that just last year all he thought about were video games, but we do not know what triggered Ahmed's transformation and the film does not pursue it.\n\nWe do know, however, that he is burdened by the memory of his cousin who apparently took his own life as a suicide bomber, a fact that the imam will not let him forget. The teenager's main source of conflict is with his teacher Inès (Myriem Akheddiou, "The Kid with a Bike"). He refuses to shake her hand because he thinks women are impure and because she is dating a person of the Jewish faith. He is also upset about her plans to use music to teach Arabic and the Quran, plans that he considers sacrilegious. Labeled by the imam as an apostate, the impressionable teenager tries to prove his faith by physically assaulting her, an action for which he is placed in juvenile custody. Even this is too much for the imam who tells Ahmed that he said to oppose her beliefs, not try to kill her.\n\nAt the juvenile facility, Ahmed is treated with respect by his caseworker, psychologist, and teachers, but the viewer is left probing for clues as to whether Ahmed regrets his actions and is willing to change or whether he is quietly planning another assault. As part of his rehabilitation, he is sent to a farm where he is befriended by Louise (Victoria Bluck), the young daughter at the farm, but even her kiss does not awaken in him a feeling for people who have a different outlook on life. While Young Ahmed centers on the fundamentalist tenets of one religion, the film is not an attack on Islam but an assertion that any idea which considers itself to be the only true belief is antithetical to long-established ideals of tolerance and religious freedom.\n\nUltimately, no words or actions of others seem to reach Ahmed. As director Jean-Pierre Dardenne put it, "Fanatics don't listen to the outside world; they build a wall between themselves and the world. Their only goal is for others to become like them, no matter the cost." Though the direction in which Ahmed is headed is unclear, it is in the moment when his body deserts him that we get a hint he knows that his only escape from the bondage of ideology is to discover the true nature of his own being and that his only loss will be that which has stood in the way of his deeper understanding of the world.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3761,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-05-22","keywords":"classroom,muslim,imam,teacher,mother son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi452115481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RiNjYyN2MtNTdhOC00MmQxLWIwYmItNzE1YjkyMjkxYTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2RiNjYyN2MtNTdhOC00MmQxLWIwYmItNzE1YjkyMjkxYTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10712072/","name":"Idir Ben Addi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5672971/","name":"Olivier Bonnaud","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4159235/","name":"Myriem Akheddiou"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201094/","name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201095/","name":"Luc Dardenne"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075922/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0016569/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201094/","name":"Jean-Pierre Dardenne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0201095/","name":"Luc Dardenne"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The film itself is completely ridiculous, and anyone who would believe that Tippi Hedren was actually being tortured by birds in take after take is either very simple minded or has no idea as to the way films are actually made...Tippi Hedren was a lukewarm actress who was angry that she could never get work after these films and has convinced herself that it must have been Hitch who was behind her failure, when it was actually the simple fact that she wasn't very good at all.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6854,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2012-10-20","keywords":"bird,model,blonde,director,actress","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1092227/","name":"Sienna Miller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0429363/","name":"Toby Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001767/","name":"Imelda Staunton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0418982/","name":"Julian Jarrold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0176427/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044704/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0400634/","name":"Gwyneth Hughes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0819488/","name":"Donald Spoto"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And this is not a good thing, especially since the producers obviously made sure that everyone knew this film was coming, so that they would watch it. And when it finally arrives, it is a complete and total flop. This did not keep me from buying again for my video collection when I saw it at Hollywood for under five dollars. All together, the storyline is slightly more interesting, as there are several gunfights and thrilling moments in which people are chased around. The film is not the thriller that it says it is. It is just another average film based on your true story (with the facts altered of course) and tries to rip off of the success of its predecessor. BRITANNIC gets 2/5.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2000-01-10","keywords":"kea,tzia,keos,greek cyclades,aegean","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0041029/","name":"Edward Atterton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0752406/","name":"Amanda Ryan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000302/","name":"Jacqueline Bisset"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0872062/","name":"Brian Trenchard-Smith"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063686/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015207/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0859920/","name":"Brett Thompson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0808993/","name":"Kim Owen Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695446/","name":"Dennis A.

It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.\n\nI thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.\n\nBottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).\n\nIf you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-08-04","keywords":"gunslinger,based on novel,prophetic dream,another world,parallel dimension","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1690417433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, roams an Old West-like landscape where "the world has moved on" in pursuit of the man in black.

Clara Bellar's acting was awful in my opinion. I was completely distracted by her performance as well as several others.\n\nWhile not a true horror movie, I really enjoyed The Beginning. I've watched it many times and found it very suspenseful. It kept my attention. I enjoyed the actors and the story. I've watched it over ten times and the scenes where Father M had to choose those to die? Chilling. Who wouldn't lose faith? The boy being torn apart?

I though that there was ANOTHER prequel that I didn't know about, until I continued to watch. Dominion seemed to me like a movie made out of pieces of film on the floor of the editing room. Clara Bellar's acting was awful in my opinion. I was completely distracted by her performance as well as several others.\n\nWhile not a true horror movie, I really enjoyed The Beginning. I've watched it many times and found it very suspenseful. It kept my attention. I enjoyed the actors and the story. I've watched it over ten times and the scenes where Father M had to choose those to die? Chilling. Who wouldn't lose faith? The boy being torn apart? There were some good scenes.\n\nPeace","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36272,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-02-09","keywords":"lucifer morningstar character,supernatural horror,psychotronic film,cgi animal in live action title,movie flop","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Exorcist: The Beginning","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3262429721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGNmNTMyZGMtNGI1My00OWRjLWE1ZGEtNDU5YmE1ZGFkYjBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGNmNTMyZGMtNGI1My00OWRjLWE1ZGEtNDU5YmE1ZGFkYjBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001745/","name":"Stellan Skarsgård","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001713/","name":"Izabella Scorupco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0195439/","name":"James D'Arcy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001317/","name":"Renny Harlin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033472/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067503/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0527643/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0087861/","name":"William Peter Blatty","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936537/","name":"William Wisher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0139627/","name":"Caleb Carr"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is said that after his friend and rival James Whistler had made a particularly apposite remark, Wilde sighed and said "I wish I had said that!". Whistler's reply was "You will, Oscar, you will". The American film industry has a similar attitude to other people's films to the one that Wilde had to other people's conversation. When the European- particularly the British or French- film industry comes up with a particularly admired film, Hollywood gives a collective sigh and says "We wish we had made that!" You will, Hollywood, you will!\n\nRecent years have seen a glut of remakes of European films, but, admittedly, the results of this creative plagiarism are by no means always bad. The plot of "Sommersby" may have been blatantly lifted from "Le Retour de Martin Guerre", but it is still a good film in its own right. Moreover, I was one of those who thought that Luc Besson's "Nikita" did not lose much in translation when it was remade as the Bridget Fonda vehicle "The Assassin". Sometimes, however, Hollywood manages to come up with a remake that is so inferior to its original model that the two films do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. "Diabolique" is a case in point.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot's "Les Diaboliques" was one of the classic thrillers of the fifties, as good as the best of Hitchcock's work. Jeremiah Chechik's remake borrows the same basic plot of the original, but transfers it from 1950s France to 1990s America. At the centre is the sadistic headmaster of a private school, a man who brutally mistreats not only the boys in his care but also his wife and even his beautiful mistress. The wife and mistress,tired of his mistreatment, plot together to murder him and to dispose of his body in the filthy school swimming pool, but when the pool is later drained the body has disappeared. As in the original, there is a sudden, surprise twist at the end. Chechik also, however,introduces elements that were not in Clouzot's film. The wife, Mia, here becomes a former nun, who has renounced her vows after losing her faith, but is still haunted by guilt. There is a suggestion of a lesbian relationship between Mia and the mistress, Nicole. Chechik also introduces a major character, in the form of a female detective, with no equivalent in the original film.\n\n"Diabolique" has come in for some sharp criticism, largely because it is a remake of a classic. It is a mediocre film rather than a horrendously bad one, and if we did not have its famous predecessor to compare it with, it would doubtless be seen as just another banal and unsuccessful crime thriller. Nevertheless, I think that the criticism it has attracted is justified. Chechik must have known that one of the perils of remaking a film is that your work will be weighed in the balance against the original, and woe betide you if it is found wanting. And, compared with Clouzot's, Chechik's film is wanting indeed. He lacks the French director's sense of pacing and ability to convey suspense, with the result that his film is slow-moving where the original was brisk and flabby where the original was taut.\n\nI was also disappointed by the acting. Isabelle Adjani can be a fine actress in her own language, as she showed in "La Reine Margot", but I have not been impressed with her in English-language films, and here her character never came to life.

It is said that after his friend and rival James Whistler had made a particularly apposite remark, Wilde sighed and said "I wish I had said that!". Whistler's reply was "You will, Oscar, you will". The American film industry has a similar attitude to other people's films to the one that Wilde had to other people's conversation. When the European- particularly the British or French- film industry comes up with a particularly admired film, Hollywood gives a collective sigh and says "We wish we had made that!" You will, Hollywood, you will!\n\nRecent years have seen a glut of remakes of European films, but, admittedly, the results of this creative plagiarism are by no means always bad. The plot of "Sommersby" may have been blatantly lifted from "Le Retour de Martin Guerre", but it is still a good film in its own right. Moreover, I was one of those who thought that Luc Besson's "Nikita" did not lose much in translation when it was remade as the Bridget Fonda vehicle "The Assassin". Sometimes, however, Hollywood manages to come up with a remake that is so inferior to its original model that the two films do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. "Diabolique" is a case in point.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot's "Les Diaboliques" was one of the classic thrillers of the fifties, as good as the best of Hitchcock's work. Jeremiah Chechik's remake borrows the same basic plot of the original, but transfers it from 1950s France to 1990s America. At the centre is the sadistic headmaster of a private school, a man who brutally mistreats not only the boys in his care but also his wife and even his beautiful mistress. The wife and mistress,tired of his mistreatment, plot together to murder him and to dispose of his body in the filthy school swimming pool, but when the pool is later drained the body has disappeared. As in the original, there is a sudden, surprise twist at the end. Chechik also, however,introduces elements that were not in Clouzot's film. The wife, Mia, here becomes a former nun, who has renounced her vows after losing her faith, but is still haunted by guilt. There is a suggestion of a lesbian relationship between Mia and the mistress, Nicole. Chechik also introduces a major character, in the form of a female detective, with no equivalent in the original film.\n\n"Diabolique" has come in for some sharp criticism, largely because it is a remake of a classic. It is a mediocre film rather than a horrendously bad one, and if we did not have its famous predecessor to compare it with, it would doubtless be seen as just another banal and unsuccessful crime thriller. Nevertheless, I think that the criticism it has attracted is justified. Chechik must have known that one of the perils of remaking a film is that your work will be weighed in the balance against the original, and woe betide you if it is found wanting. And, compared with Clouzot's, Chechik's film is wanting indeed. He lacks the French director's sense of pacing and ability to convey suspense, with the result that his film is slow-moving where the original was brisk and flabby where the original was taut.\n\nI was also disappointed by the acting. Isabelle Adjani can be a fine actress in her own language, as she showed in "La Reine Margot", but I have not been impressed with her in English-language films, and here her character never came to life. Sharon Stone was slightly better as the hard-bitten, sluttish Nicole, but this was not really one of her better performances and did nothing to alter my view that she has not always chosen the best vehicles in which to show off her talents. Chazz Palminteri's headmaster was almost too unpleasant to be believable, and Kathy Bates seemed wasted as the detective. Watching Clouzot's film I was glued to the screen with anticipation as I wondered how the film would end; watching Chechik's, my attention was rather glued to my watch as I wondered when it would end. 4/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14083,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1996-10-28","keywords":"stockings,woman on top,dead body in a bathtub,dead body in a car,death in a bathtub","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Diabolique","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi950141209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000254/","name":"Isabelle Adjani","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154819/","name":"Jeremiah S.

I guess that's an easy approach to take when summing this film up, since its two female leads featured in Party Of Five and episodes of Doogie Howser (man what an awful show that was), not to mention that one of the male leads would be doing well to act his way out of a wet paper bag. The problem with that is that it is just too easy, and easy answer is exactly the sort of thing that this film goes out of its way to avoid. It is not trying to be a modern Hitchcock, it is not trying to be another Basic Instinct, it is just trying to tell a story.\n\nThe story, such as it is, seems to revolve around Blue Bay High School, the town it is located in, and its snobby, high-income elite, at least in the first reel. We are introduced to all four of the characters who will figure prominently in the story to come during a lecture to the students in their senior year. There's Sam the guidance counsellor, Ray the corrupt policeman, Kelly the daughter of the wealthiest real estate mogul in town, and Suzie the girl from the caravan park across town. All four of these characters have secrets they'd rather not share with any other inhabitant of the town, but that all comes apart when Kelly accuses Sam of raping her. Suzie corroborates her story at first, but then we get our first inkling that things are not all they seem, through the efforts of Bill Murray in one of his best cameos ever. The whole thing is seemingly a conspiracy between Sam, Suzie, and Kelly, but we are never shown whose idea it is until the very end.\n\nThis next passage will ruin a key surprise the film has in store, so don't read it if you haven't seen it. Unless things have radically changed in this regard during the last ten years, psychologists and other such professionals do not tell test subjects exactly what their IQ is. Even if Suzie or her mother did know exactly, this whole point is delivered with such sledgehammer force that it almost utterly ruins the subtle, slow buildup that the rest of the film exhibited. Were they just running out of money when it came time to film this spot and just decided to go with the quickest, simplest thing they could do? It would have been much more effective and satisfying if the ugly cop (I forget the name) had just spent five or ten minutes going through whatever Suzie had left behind on her run to the Carribean. Summing up this plot point in fifteen seconds was an exceptionally bad move.\n\nOverall, however, you can't really go wrong with this film for an evening's entertainment. It doesn't feel the need to talk down at its audience, it doesn't resort to excess simplicity to make itself understood (except for the aforementioned ending), it just tells a story and tells it reasonably well. It is also another great example of DVD's utter superiority, especially during the threesome scene. When this part of the film is shown in its proper aspect ratio, you can make out every character and certain little details I'm sure that Denise Richards would appreciate not having available to horny teenage boys in a freezable and zoomable format. When was the last time you zoomed in on an actress' boobs with a VHS cassette, assuming they were left in frame after some jerk with an editing console chopped it down to fit those garbage 4:3 screens?"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":115320,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1998-03-20","keywords":"erotic thriller,lesbian sex,taboo sex,sex with a student,lesbian kiss","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wild Things","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3053256985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDQ4NzA3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgyMTg2MQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDQ4NzA3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgyMTg2MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000102/","name":"Kevin Bacon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000117/","name":"Neve Campbell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000369/","name":"Matt Dillon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0573796/","name":"John McNaughton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033437/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002983/","name":"Stephen Peters"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A police detective uncovers a conspiracy behind a case involving a high-school guidance counselor when accusations of rape are made against him by two female students." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0120890/","name":"Wild Things","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODMyYTlkNWYtODAzMC00ZjFiLWE3YjctMGUyMzM1MDk3ZDFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTQxNzMzNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A police detective uncovers a conspiracy behind a case involving a high-school guidance counselor when accusations of rape are made against him by two female students.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0120890/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"mentalcritic","dateCreated":"2001-07-09","inLanguage":"English","name":"Much more intelligent than it is often given credit for...","reviewBody":"During the very limited theatrical run that Wild Things recieved here (I think it was gone in about three weeks), a lot of the reviews and publicity created the impression that this was a soap opera sex thriller. I guess that's an easy approach to take when summing this film up, since its two female leads featured in Party Of Five and episodes of Doogie Howser (man what an awful show that was), not to mention that one of the male leads would be doing well to act his way out of a wet paper bag. The problem with that is that it is just too easy, and easy answer is exactly the sort of thing that this film goes out of its way to avoid. It is not trying to be a modern Hitchcock, it is not trying to be another Basic Instinct, it is just trying to tell a story.\n\nThe story, such as it is, seems to revolve around Blue Bay High School, the town it is located in, and its snobby, high-income elite, at least in the first reel. We are introduced to all four of the characters who will figure prominently in the story to come during a lecture to the students in their senior year. There's Sam the guidance counsellor, Ray the corrupt policeman, Kelly the daughter of the wealthiest real estate mogul in town, and Suzie the girl from the caravan park across town. All four of these characters have secrets they'd rather not share with any other inhabitant of the town, but that all comes apart when Kelly accuses Sam of raping her. Suzie corroborates her story at first, but then we get our first inkling that things are not all they seem, through the efforts of Bill Murray in one of his best cameos ever. The whole thing is seemingly a conspiracy between Sam, Suzie, and Kelly, but we are never shown whose idea it is until the very end.\n\nThis next passage will ruin a key surprise the film has in store, so don't read it if you haven't seen it. Unless things have radically changed in this regard during the last ten years, psychologists and other such professionals do not tell test subjects exactly what their IQ is. Even if Suzie or her mother did know exactly, this whole point is delivered with such sledgehammer force that it almost utterly ruins the subtle, slow buildup that the rest of the film exhibited. Were they just running out of money when it came time to film this spot and just decided to go with the quickest, simplest thing they could do? It would have been much more effective and satisfying if the ugly cop (I forget the name) had just spent five or ten minutes going through whatever Suzie had left behind on her run to the Carribean. Summing up this plot point in fifteen seconds was an exceptionally bad move.\n\nOverall, however, you can't really go wrong with this film for an evening's entertainment. It doesn't feel the need to talk down at its audience, it doesn't resort to excess simplicity to make itself understood (except for the aforementioned ending), it just tells a story and tells it reasonably well. It is also another great example of DVD's utter superiority, especially during the threesome scene. When this part of the film is shown in its proper aspect ratio, you can make out every character and certain little details I'm sure that Denise Richards would appreciate not having available to horny teenage boys in a freezable and zoomable format. When was the last time you zoomed in on an actress' boobs with a VHS cassette, assuming they were left in frame after some jerk with an editing console chopped it down to fit those garbage 4:3 screens?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":115320,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1998-03-20","keywords":"erotic thriller,lesbian sex,taboo sex,sex with a student,lesbian kiss","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Wild Things","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3053256985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDQ4NzA3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgyMTg2MQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUwMDQ4NzA3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjgyMTg2MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000102/","name":"Kevin Bacon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000117/","name":"Neve Campbell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000369/","name":"Matt Dillon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0573796/","name":"John McNaughton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033437/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002983/","name":"Stephen Peters"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Since then, 'found footage' and 'handicam'-style films have become all the rage. There was the less-remembered 'Last Broadcast' which actually preceded Blair Witch but did not capture the imagination in the same way the viral marketing method pioneered by Haxan Films managed to. And since those early days, well-received efforts such as Cloverfield and Paranormal Activity have upped the budget but endeavoured to keep themselves to the same principles.\n\nSo, with these films now extremely common, it takes something a bit special to stand out. Sadly, nothing about 'A Night in the Woods' is special, and it blows several good chances to be a great film, instead ending up a bit of a mess of a production which could have been so much more.\n\nThe story sees 3 'friends' decide to go camping out in Dartmoor - the complete lack of explanation as to why they are going there is one mild flaw. A 'sinister' (contrived) element of risk is thrown in with a visit to an Irish pub and tales of horror from the area the intrepid 3 are aiming for. And after a very long and dragged-out first portion of the movie we finally end up on location for a night in the woods.\n\nThis film tries insanely hard to be Blair Witch, in Britain. Just like the earlier masterpiece it's 3 friends isolated in the woods with inexplicable evil apparently descending upon them. And to its credit it does manage to create a semblance of tension approaching the crescendo of the story.\n\nBut unfortunately the makers decided to throw in a whole bunch of bizarre red herrings which made no sense. They included revelatory back story but unfortunately none of it was remotely developed nor did it make any sense in context of the environment - it did not appear to affect anything.\n\nThey also included a few moments which were from the eyes of certain characters. The whole point of these films is you only ever see from the view of the camera they are holding. As soon as you get an eye-view from a character who has no camera, it doesn't work.\n\nIt was, as mentioned, also let horribly down by the unnecessarily long intro - the story took far too long to get going and created the criminal error of making every character dislikeable in the process.\n\nThat all said it is not the worst cam film I have ever seen, but it was poorly-conceived and lacked sense and cohesion.

It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.\n\nI thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.\n\nBottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).\n\nIf you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-08-04","keywords":"gunslinger,based on novel,prophetic dream,another world,parallel dimension","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1690417433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, roams an Old West-like landscape where "the world has moved on" in pursuit of the man in black.

Did I just see the same movie I have heard several professional movie critics review negatively or indifferently? The first review I read online for Remember Me was that it was trite, predictable, and drawn out. (Bull, I say.) The responses of those around me in the theater today proved those claims false as well. I saw people laughing, gasping, wincing, and weeping. I saw the audience RELATING.\n\nThe characters are multi-dimensional and the acting is fantastic. This movie was not just feel-good fluff.

The responses of those around me in the theater today proved those claims false as well. I saw people laughing, gasping, wincing, and weeping. I saw the audience RELATING.\n\nThe characters are multi-dimensional and the acting is fantastic. This movie was not just feel-good fluff.

It is said that after his friend and rival James Whistler had made a particularly apposite remark, Wilde sighed and said "I wish I had said that!". Whistler's reply was "You will, Oscar, you will". The American film industry has a similar attitude to other people's films to the one that Wilde had to other people's conversation. When the European- particularly the British or French- film industry comes up with a particularly admired film, Hollywood gives a collective sigh and says "We wish we had made that!" You will, Hollywood, you will!\n\nRecent years have seen a glut of remakes of European films, but, admittedly, the results of this creative plagiarism are by no means always bad. The plot of "Sommersby" may have been blatantly lifted from "Le Retour de Martin Guerre", but it is still a good film in its own right. Moreover, I was one of those who thought that Luc Besson's "Nikita" did not lose much in translation when it was remade as the Bridget Fonda vehicle "The Assassin". Sometimes, however, Hollywood manages to come up with a remake that is so inferior to its original model that the two films do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. "Diabolique" is a case in point.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot's "Les Diaboliques" was one of the classic thrillers of the fifties, as good as the best of Hitchcock's work. Jeremiah Chechik's remake borrows the same basic plot of the original, but transfers it from 1950s France to 1990s America. At the centre is the sadistic headmaster of a private school, a man who brutally mistreats not only the boys in his care but also his wife and even his beautiful mistress. The wife and mistress,tired of his mistreatment, plot together to murder him and to dispose of his body in the filthy school swimming pool, but when the pool is later drained the body has disappeared. As in the original, there is a sudden, surprise twist at the end. Chechik also, however,introduces elements that were not in Clouzot's film. The wife, Mia, here becomes a former nun, who has renounced her vows after losing her faith, but is still haunted by guilt. There is a suggestion of a lesbian relationship between Mia and the mistress, Nicole. Chechik also introduces a major character, in the form of a female detective, with no equivalent in the original film.\n\n"Diabolique" has come in for some sharp criticism, largely because it is a remake of a classic. It is a mediocre film rather than a horrendously bad one, and if we did not have its famous predecessor to compare it with, it would doubtless be seen as just another banal and unsuccessful crime thriller. Nevertheless, I think that the criticism it has attracted is justified. Chechik must have known that one of the perils of remaking a film is that your work will be weighed in the balance against the original, and woe betide you if it is found wanting. And, compared with Clouzot's, Chechik's film is wanting indeed. He lacks the French director's sense of pacing and ability to convey suspense, with the result that his film is slow-moving where the original was brisk and flabby where the original was taut.\n\nI was also disappointed by the acting. Isabelle Adjani can be a fine actress in her own language, as she showed in "La Reine Margot", but I have not been impressed with her in English-language films, and here her character never came to life. Sharon Stone was slightly better as the hard-bitten, sluttish Nicole, but this was not really one of her better performances and did nothing to alter my view that she has not always chosen the best vehicles in which to show off her talents. Chazz Palminteri's headmaster was almost too unpleasant to be believable, and Kathy Bates seemed wasted as the detective. Watching Clouzot's film I was glued to the screen with anticipation as I wondered how the film would end; watching Chechik's, my attention was rather glued to my watch as I wondered when it would end. 4/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14083,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1996-10-28","keywords":"stockings,woman on top,dead body in a bathtub,dead body in a car,death in a bathtub","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Diabolique","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi950141209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000254/","name":"Isabelle Adjani"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154819/","name":"Jeremiah S.

Examples of standout real-time films would include Tom Cruise (amazing) in COLLATERAL; Dennis Weaver in DUEL; and the Canadian sci-fi epic, CUBE.\n\nSo now that you know first-rate films CAN potentially be made using the technique, the writer/director of this film (to be kind) did not set his sights quite that high.\n\nOverall, it is not a bad film, it is incredibly engaging given how little is actually going on. However, while all films require a suspension of disbelief, the overall problem with COP CAR is that the two lead characters, boys of about ten years of age, are written as the dumbest children ever to appear in a feature film.\n\nSeriously.

Examples of standout real-time films would include Tom Cruise (amazing) in COLLATERAL; Dennis Weaver in DUEL; and the Canadian sci-fi epic, CUBE.\n\nSo now that you know first-rate films CAN potentially be made using the technique, the writer/director of this film (to be kind) did not set his sights quite that high.\n\nOverall, it is not a bad film, it is incredibly engaging given how little is actually going on. However, while all films require a suspension of disbelief, the overall problem with COP CAR is that the two lead characters, boys of about ten years of age, are written as the dumbest children ever to appear in a feature film.\n\nSeriously. In an age where even the Disney channel attributes 'tude, street cred, smarts and fast moves to 7 year olds (ask your child if you don't believe me) these two characters as written are so far removed from coherent thought that the audience starts to wonder if they escaped from "special class."

Father doesn't always know best, the latest result being After Earth, a  vanity project that Will Smith has concocted for his son, Jaden. This  wobbly sci-fi tale of survival will certainly test both Mr. and Mr.  Smith's star power. Director M. Night Shyamalan, the man who  continually keeps falling from grace, one film after the next, is still  tumbling further from his talented beginnings, although here the  director crashes and burns.   This is not to say that After Earth is hopelessly clichéd, it's just  hopeless. Shymalan's well- made film has some striking imagery, mostly  of panoramic vistas, but his ill-conceived screenplay (co-written with  Gary Whitta) keeps this exercise in filmmaking rather earthbound.  Adding to that, his main star and one of the film's producers, Papa  Smith, pushes nepotism to its limits with this unoriginal dreck. (He is  also given story credit for this silliness.) It's not just that this  film has no Will power, it just has too much of it, both on screen and  off.  Will Smith plays the fearless Cypher Raige, a no-nonsense military  commando sent on a mission with his newt of a son, Kitai, played by  Jaden Smith. Cypher is disappointed with his son's lack of achievement  as a cadet and their relationship is a bit strained, just like the  acting. The Smiths obviously look the part and act the part with the  same stilted delivery. Like father, like son. Unfortunately (for us),  they crash land on the apocalyptic Planet Earth. Cypher is injured with  two broken legs, but pain is not an option. However a better script  would have helped matters. Kitai must now go into rescue mode, wearing  his amazing technicolor space suit, fighting beasts and creatures along  the way to becoming a man.   On his journey of self-awareness, Kitai contends with imminent peril:  giant baboons, poisonous leeches, carnivorous tigers, and such. He  needs to deal with the fluctuating below-freezing temperatures and an  active volcano too. Life is hard. Kitai even battles a monster called  the Ursa, a predator that hunts by sensing fear. (If the creature could  instead sense the smorgasbord of bad acting on its plate, the Ursa  would never go hungry again.) The elder Smith underacts and speaks in  annoying solemn platitudes while the younger Smith overacts in a  squeaky nasal voice that only a teenager can tolerate.   The art direction is mind-numbing. The futuristic sets are bargain  basement knockoffs of Disney World's Tomorrowland, circa 1960...very  unimaginative with an overabundance of Rubbermaid-influenced interiors  and enough flowing linen sheets to make one think that Bed, Bath, and  Beyond had given the filmmakers a cut-rate deal for some product  endorsements. All of the special effects are barely adequate and not  the least bit compelling. After Earth has a strange lethargic  listlessness throughout its short length. The film never builds any  real tension or suspense. It's just so dull and unrelenting in its  stupidity.  After Earth is the type of film that gives the sci-fi genre a bad name.  Shyamalan and the Smiths might want to use other aliases after creating  this debacle. Let's hope they refine their own survival skills when  making another film. After Earth is strictly Ursa Minor.   So dear moviegoers, heed the film's tag-line: "Danger is real, Fear is  a choice".

Father doesn't always know best, the latest result being After Earth, a  vanity project that Will Smith has concocted for his son, Jaden. This  wobbly sci-fi tale of survival will certainly test both Mr. and Mr.  Smith's star power. Director M. Night Shyamalan, the man who  continually keeps falling from grace, one film after the next, is still  tumbling further from his talented beginnings, although here the  director crashes and burns.   This is not to say that After Earth is hopelessly clichéd, it's just  hopeless. Shymalan's well- made film has some striking imagery, mostly  of panoramic vistas, but his ill-conceived screenplay (co-written with  Gary Whitta) keeps this exercise in filmmaking rather earthbound.  Adding to that, his main star and one of the film's producers, Papa  Smith, pushes nepotism to its limits with this unoriginal dreck. (He is  also given story credit for this silliness.) It's not just that this  film has no Will power, it just has too much of it, both on screen and  off.  Will Smith plays the fearless Cypher Raige, a no-nonsense military  commando sent on a mission with his newt of a son, Kitai, played by  Jaden Smith. Cypher is disappointed with his son's lack of achievement  as a cadet and their relationship is a bit strained, just like the  acting. The Smiths obviously look the part and act the part with the  same stilted delivery. Like father, like son. Unfortunately (for us),  they crash land on the apocalyptic Planet Earth. Cypher is injured with  two broken legs, but pain is not an option. However a better script  would have helped matters. Kitai must now go into rescue mode, wearing  his amazing technicolor space suit, fighting beasts and creatures along  the way to becoming a man.   On his journey of self-awareness, Kitai contends with imminent peril:  giant baboons, poisonous leeches, carnivorous tigers, and such. He  needs to deal with the fluctuating below-freezing temperatures and an  active volcano too. Life is hard. Kitai even battles a monster called  the Ursa, a predator that hunts by sensing fear. (If the creature could  instead sense the smorgasbord of bad acting on its plate, the Ursa  would never go hungry again.) The elder Smith underacts and speaks in  annoying solemn platitudes while the younger Smith overacts in a  squeaky nasal voice that only a teenager can tolerate.   The art direction is mind-numbing. The futuristic sets are bargain  basement knockoffs of Disney World's Tomorrowland, circa 1960...very  unimaginative with an overabundance of Rubbermaid-influenced interiors  and enough flowing linen sheets to make one think that Bed, Bath, and  Beyond had given the filmmakers a cut-rate deal for some product  endorsements. All of the special effects are barely adequate and not  the least bit compelling. After Earth has a strange lethargic  listlessness throughout its short length. The film never builds any  real tension or suspense. It's just so dull and unrelenting in its  stupidity.  After Earth is the type of film that gives the sci-fi genre a bad name.  Shyamalan and the Smiths might want to use other aliases after creating  this debacle. Let's hope they refine their own survival skills when  making another film. After Earth is strictly Ursa Minor.   So dear moviegoers, heed the film's tag-line: "Danger is real, Fear is  a choice". You have been sufficiently warned about the real dangers in  viewing After Earth...Fear not, it's still in your control.

More sex, language, unreal car chases? Less plot and enough action sequences in one episode to give your brain an epileptic seizure? After getting hooked on fun, entertaining shows like The Good Cop and Battle Creek only to have them cancelled after one season, I give up trying to figure out today's viewers. No, LA's Finest isn't perfect (or totally realistic, but hey, what show is?). Yet it's pretty engaging. The story lines keep me coming back for more episodes and I think the acting is pretty good.

"Desperate times, desperate measures" is a phrase that dates back to ancient Greek physician Hippocrates (he of the Hippocratic Oath), and has been applied in many and varied situations since ... war strategy being one of the most common. We hear the phrase a couple of times in the War Room during an early scene in the feature film directorial debut of writer-director Sven Huybrechts submarine movie. The term "submarine movie" is used with the utmost respect, as I'm a huge fan of the sub-genre.\n\nOpening with a well-orchestrated attack on Nazi soldiers, we are soon in the midst of a group of resistance fighters - a rag tag bunch committed to wiping out as many Nazis as possible. In the War Room scene, this group is referred to as "The Bad Eggs", and everyone from all sides seems to want them stopped. However, there is a problem - this group is made up of the only ones crazy enough to accept the current 'suicide' mission: delivering a Uranium filled submarine from the Belgian Congo to the United States, where the cargo will be used for the Manhattan Project.\n\nThe cast is excellent, led by the ongoing conflict between two outstanding and renowned leads: Belgian actor Koen De Bouw as Nazi-hater Stan, and German actor Thure Riefenstein as captured U-Boat Captain Franz Jager. Co-writers Huybrechts and Johan Horemans effectively use the dangers and claustrophobia of the submarine, and are truly expert in their pitting Stan against Jager. Stan's beautiful (and sharpshooter) daughter Nadine (Ella-June Henrard) is also on the mission, but it's Stan's tragic backstory (which we see in tension-filled flashbacks) that have filled him with a lust for revenge and over-protectiveness.\n\nTraining for submarine crews typically lasts a year, and this group of misfits has only three weeks to prepare. Some of the early soundtrack reminds of the iconic Elmer Bernstein theme to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, which comes across a bit misplaced, but that's a minor quibble for a film that gets most everything else right - except for a too-good-to-be-true sequence near the end. Along the way, we see vivid images of the brutality and cruelty of Nazis, which helps us understand why all of these folks are so committed to the mission.\n\nWorking with a low budget, the film still manages to deliver the danger and tense situations we expect from a submarine during WWII. There is even a sub vs sub battle for some underwater action. The lineup of other worthy submarine movies over the years include: Jules Verne's 20,000 LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA (1954), THE ENEMY BELOW (1957) with Robert Mitchum, RUN SILENT, RUN DEEP (1958) with Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster, ICE STATION ZEBRA (1968) based on the Alistair MacLean novel, the nerve-rattling DAS BOOT (1981) from Werner Herzog, THE ABYSS (1989) from James Cameron, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER (1990) from Tom Clancy's novel starring Sean Connery, CRIMSON TIDE (1995) pitting Denzel Washington against Gene Hackman, U-571 (2000) with the great Thomas Kretschmann, and BLACK SEA (2014) with Jude Law. And let's not forget the 1968 classic featuring The Beatles animated, YELLOW SUBMARIINE.\n\nThis latest begins in 1941 and the final scene takes place on August 6, 1945. Huybrechts's film could be described as a cross between INGLORIOUS BASTERDS and DAS BOOT, and it includes plenty of material for conversation on race, religion, nationality, and duty.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2466,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"genre":["Action","Adventure","History"],"datePublished":"2019-10-23","keywords":"submarine,u boat,submarine movie,war at sea,claustrophobic setting","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Torpedo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4286758425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI4Yjg0NGUtNjg1YS00YzFmLWJmY2QtMWM0OWM1YzgwMDMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGI4Yjg0NGUtNjg1YS00YzFmLWJmY2QtMWM0OWM1YzgwMDMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0100460/","name":"Koen De Bouw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0726167/","name":"Thure Riefenstein"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3616170/","name":"Ella-June Henrard"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404748/","name":"Sven Huybrechts"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293701/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0287211/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034024/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393822/","name":"Johan Horemans"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0404748/","name":"Sven Huybrechts"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

At worst  bigoted and offensive","reviewBody":"Earl Montgomery is a cop wannabe who can't get past the academy into the force.  Hank Rafferty is a real cop who is emotionally on edge having seen the murder of his partner by a gang raiding a warehouse.  When the two get involved in a minor roadside traffic stop, Earl claims Hank beat him and gets him thrown off the force.  Hank takes up a job as a security guard and sets out to find the gang that killed his partner.  He finds them in a warehouse protected by Earl (also now a security guard) and the two reluctantly team up to go after the gang.  However when they steal the gang's merchandise they find themselves hunted by both the gang and the cops.\n\nAlthough I like to think of myself as having reasonably good taste  I do find Martin Lawrence funny.  I don't know why but many of his films just make me laugh even though I feel like I shouldn't !  However this film is the recent exception to that.  I saw the trailer and thought that it might be worth a stab  wrong!  The plot is a shambles of coincidence and plot holes  where there is a doubt they simply have a big gun fight.  There is no real tension to the plot as it is so very loose  even at the end you'll struggle to know much about the plot outside of the two central characters.\n\nThe action scenes make the A-Team look realistic and tense  they are simply tonnes of bullets flying everywhere before the bad guys are dispatched with one shot!  This sucks any excitement or tension out of them and only leaves you with lots of noise that just feels pointless in the extreme.  In that way they reflect the wider plot I guess.  Sadly though, the poor action and poor plot is by no means the worst part of this film.\n\nEasily the worst part of this film is the fact that 99% of the `jokes' are based on race  in particular Martin Lawrence's comments which are either a) laments on the victimisation of his race or b) reverse-racism remarks that border on the offensive and would certainly never be allowed to pass if the lines had been given to his white co-star.  The victimisation things are simply not funny and merely make the lead look like he has an enormous chip on his shoulder about his colour  maybe 2 or 3 remarks along these lines would have worked but to have nearly every line based on this is simply overkill and it quickly gets tiresome.  Other remarks I simply found offensive  I'm sorry, I know this is meant to be a comedy but I found them bigoted in the extreme.  What makes it worse is the fact that the film plays Earl as a hero and never shows him to change his way or his opinion  hence it validates what he says.  For example to have a character state that he is against interracial relationships between white men and black women (and never take it back) is simply offensive  as I (a white man) sat with my wife of Nigerian-descent I felt very uncomfortable that anyone would allow such insulting dialogue to be part of a film.  Even if you think I am making a big deal out of nothing  just imagine this whole film if even half of Earl's dialogue had been said by Hank  there would simply have been an outcry!\n\nTo make the offensive material worse  it is rarely funny.  I don't know what Lawrence is up to.  This summer he has the chance to kick start his big league career again in Bad Boys 2 where he'll get help from Smith and Union  but this is a huge leap back  pandering to an audience that may find it funny because they too have a chip on their shoulder about race.  I usually find his mugging and saying `yo ass' or `and sh*t' after every sentence funny but here the chip on his character should simply obliterates everything else.  Zahn is poor  I have not seen him in a strong role but this must be a step backwards even by his standards  he suffers at the hands of racist remarks and comes off badly  even his relationship with Denise is played for laughs as the writers expected the audience to find it a joke that Hank could land with a `fine sista' like that, it even goes so far as to have Denise admire Earl's penis!!  In fairness Robinne Lee (Denise) is gorgeous and it is good to see her in something again after only seeing her in Hav Plenty. God knows why Eric Roberts is in it  he has nothing to do and his wig just looked stupid, likewise Bill Duke is only there for the dirty looks.\n\nOverall I enjoy Lawrence comedies even though many are silly.  Here the jokes are nearly all based on race or reverse-racism and after the first 3 time they get increasingly unfunny and tired.  At best this film is lame and barely amusing, at worst it is simply bigoted (regardless of what colour the character is  bigotry is bigotry) and will be offensive to anyone who tries to get past the issues of race and racism in their daily lives."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49753,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2003-03-12","keywords":"los angeles police department,lapd,ex con,race relations,dirty cop","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"National Security","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi497942809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzdmYWY1NzMtZDZhOC00OTM5LWJkNjUtOGQzYWE5NGM2ZmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzdmYWY1NzMtZDZhOC00OTM5LWJkNjUtOGQzYWE5NGM2ZmMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001454/","name":"Martin Lawrence"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001872/","name":"Steve Zahn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272173/","name":"Colm Feore"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014629/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010183/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771065/","name":"Jay Scherick"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740115/","name":"David Ronn"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Zmarły w 2009 roku Marek Edelman był ostatnim przywódcą powstania w getcie warszawskim. Przed swoją śmiercią odpowiedział na pytanie, czy w getcie była miłość i jak ona się przejawiała. Film jest odpowiedzią na książkę Marka Edelmana i Pauli Sawickiej o tym samym tytule, która zawiera wspomnienia mężczyzny. Przy jego scenariuszu współpracowała Agnieszka Holland, a jego fabularyzowane sceny współreżyserował Andrzej Wajda.</desc>

However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.\n\nOverall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.\n\nPawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.\n\nHervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.\n\nThe scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.\n\nGreat film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":777302,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5},"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2002-09-25","keywords":"pianist,holocaust,survival,nazi occupied poland,person in a wheelchair falls from height","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Pianist","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi988938521","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ4MWQzNDEtYmI4Zi00NmY0LWEwYTEtZTg4MmQ3MDM2YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ4MWQzNDEtYmI4Zi00NmY0LWEwYTEtZTg4MmQ3MDM2YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Focus Features"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004778/","name":"Adrien Brody"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470981/","name":"Thomas Kretschmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277975/","name":"Frank Finlay"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024473/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030304/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053177/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0844262/","name":"Wladyslaw Szpilman"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Oh well, I seemed to enjoy the fictional league even better, even if some of the team uniforms were a dreadful. Jamie Fox portrayed Willie Beamon perfectly, epitomizing the selfish athlete with a cultured ease.

While some of the scenes were a little too over the top, it proved to be a very enjoyable experience. As a major football fan, I was disappointed in the fact the NFL did not allow Stone to use their logos and stadiums. Oh well, I seemed to enjoy the fictional league even better, even if some of the team uniforms were a dreadful. Jamie Fox portrayed Willie Beamon perfectly, epitomizing the selfish athlete with a cultured ease. While the speed of Beamon's rise proved to be a little too quick, the message in the rise and fall of stardom was more poignant than anything.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116050,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1999-12-22","keywords":"nudity,black penis,american football,male objectification,man wrapped in a towel","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000598/","name":"Dennis Quaid","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000231/","name":"Oliver Stone"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0119040/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001946/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002417/","name":"Daniel Pyne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0517589/","name":"John Logan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000231/","name":"Oliver Stone"],"duration":"PT2H42M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Koledzy traktują nową towarzyszkę z wyższością, są wobec niej szorstcy i nie szczędzą jej szowinistycznych żartów. Gdy jednak na pokładzie ujawnia swoją obecność legendarny gremlin, który stanowi śmiertelne zagrożenie, waleczna kobieta udowodni, ile jest warta. Wojenny horror z feministycznym przesłaniem.</desc>

They get support by a businessman who lost the sense of his life.\n\nIt is very striking, many funny stereotypes and it's made funny (very funny having simple-minded farmers as potential audience) and with a certain social-critical note, but in the end there is a happy end.\n\nThe overall quality is well too. Enjoyable film for the whole family if the plot sounds good to you.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1860,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2001-01-05","keywords":"unemployment,suicide attempt,social differences,small business,ransom","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464945/","name":"Marek Kondrat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148077/","name":"Stanislawa Celinska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532769/","name":"Sylwester Maciejewski"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532702/","name":"Juliusz Machulski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043688/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108635/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007265/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1008161/","name":"Jaroslaw Sokól"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Getting told that the local Odeon were doing a one-off screening of a interesting-sounding Polish Drama later that day,I got set to meet Zieja.\n\nNote:Some spoilers in review.\n\nView on the film:\n\nOn opposing sides not only round the table, but also morally, Andrzej Seweryn and Zbigniew Zamachowski set the screen ablaze in Zieja and Grosicki's interrogation sequences, thanks to the stamping of feet frustration Zamachowski gives Grosicki being counted in this psychological duel with a upright, quiet confidence Seweryn has beaming from every word of Zieja.\n\nA important figure sadly not that well known outside of Poland, the screenplay by Wojciech Lepianka spans a impressively compact bio-pic on Jan Zieja, going right back in flashbacks to Zieja's involvement in the Warsaw Uprising,to the 70's,where Zieja's liberal liturgical catches the attention of the Communists secret services.\n\nBased around the interrogation with Zieja and Grosicki, Lepianka's consistent move to flashbacks gives what should be the centrepiece of the title a stop-start atmosphere, where just as tensions are starting to build, Lepianka steps back and enters a flashback.\n\nRolling up the opening sequence to Grosicki being a slob in bed, director Robert Glinski &amp; cinematographer Witold Plociennik firmly place Zieja on the other side with graceful close-ups and splintered shadows casting a spiritual aura on Zieja.\n\nClosely working with editor Ewa Smal, Glinski stylishly links Zieja's experience at the interrogation table with the horrors he's faced in life,via pristine match-cuts linking the flashbacks and the present into each other,along with eye-catch screen-wipes performed by Zieja walking across the screen to deliver a sermon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":93,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-08-28","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0786614/","name":"Andrzej Seweryn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5851110/","name":"Mateusz Wieclawek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0952498/","name":"Zbigniew Zamachowski"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322894/","name":"Robert Glinski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0087308/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0185099/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0503287/","name":"Wojciech Lepianka"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After experiencing the film earlier today, I can say it was a tremendous experience.\n\nI felt the first thirty minutes or so were the strongest of the entire film, plunging us into the despair and conflicts of various characters with adroit narrative thrust so that not a moment feels wasted or redundant. Two of the three (in my opinion) gut-wrenching musical numbers come in this section- Anne Hathaway's "I Dreamed a Dream" (which, if I recall correctly, was filmed largely in a single take) and Hugh Jackman's "Who Am I?". I can only speculate but, compared to the stage version, being able to take in every facial nuance in the film version seems to make the moments of crescendo and soaring strings pack so much more of an emotional punch. Both Hathaway and Jackman also deliver top-notch performances, and it's hard to imagine anyone else fitting the role of Valjean as well as Jackman. \n\nThematically, the film also shines in this section. Here we are introduced to the major theme of forgiveness for the first time, through Fantine we tap into maternal bonds as well as disillusionment, and Valjean's struggles explore the conflict between not only public and private selves but also reconciling our own personal interests with what is morally correct.\n\nIt seemed curious to me that the bleakest moments of the film (at least for me) came at the beginning, which made it impossible for the film to regain that same sense of gravitas as the story progressed. While the remainder of the film was certainly entertaining, it felt both less emotionally involving and less taut than the beginning.\n\nHelena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen provided some much appreciated comic relief, but their antics seemed oddly out of place in this film at times, and often left me feeling as though I were watching Sweeney Todd again. Russell Crowe, while certainly no vocal powerhouse, did a fine job as Javert, although I found his final number to be oddly anti-climactic. The younger actors gave fine performances as well, with Samantha Barks demonstrating the most potential and Eddie Redmayne surprisingly delivering the final gut-wrenching number, "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables." The thematic exploration of the rise and fall of idealism makes this sequence especially poignant.\n\nArtistically, Les Miserables is a feast. The production design is top-notch, with meticulously crafted sets and props. Makeup and costumes are definitely noteworthy as well. Many of the shots of Paris have an artificially beautiful aesthetic to them, and every crane shot adds a sense of beauty and scope to the piece. Editorially, the film makes takes advantage of cuts to characters in different locations or concurrent events which would not have been possible in the stage version of Les Mis.\n\nOne minor complaint from a filmmaking perspective was cinematographer Danny Cohen's method of framing characters. Conventional cinematography typically frames actors so that their faces are demarcating either the left or right third of the screen, with the camera positioned so that their subjects are turned towards the remaining two thirds of the screen. In Les Miserables (though thankfully not to the same extent as in The King's Speech), a few times the characters are positioned so that they are facing the other direction- the edge of the screen. Though I imagine the filmmakers were attempting to add visual flourish to the film, I found this technique oddly jarring, drawing me out of the film and making me conscious I was watching a movie.\n\nThe film does regain some levity in its rousing finale, which ties the film together in plot, theme, and song. Despite the minor issues I had with the film, I found it to be a hard-hitting and rousing work of art. I could probably sum it up best by noting that this is the first movie I've been to where even old men were wiping their teary eyes by the time the credits rolled.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":319889,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Musical","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-01-02","keywords":"rebellion,france,orphan,parole,barricade","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winner: Best Supporting Actress","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2712512281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5ODYxODY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3OTc3OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5ODYxODY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3OTc3OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch a TV trailer for Les Miserables."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103961/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0629933/","name":"William Nicholson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0098842/","name":"Alain Boublil"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0774744/","name":"Claude-Michel Schönberg"}],"duration":"PT2H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He handles the husband-to-a-celebrity role with a charm not seen since Eric Roberts in STAR 80.\n\nThe subject matter may cost the film at awards time, but it's still an excellent movie that you should definitely check out if you have any interest at all in the story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200749,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-05","keywords":"ice skating,violence,abuse,female protagonist,ice skater","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer: I, Tonya","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4244617241","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVhNGQ1NzEtYmYyYi00YTUxLTk4MDMtMDZjOTYzNDA2MzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVhNGQ1NzEtYmYyYi00YTUxLTk4MDMtMDZjOTYzNDA2MzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding rises among the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband intervenes."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659221/","name":"Sebastian Stan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005049/","name":"Allison Janney"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0318916/","name":"Craig Gillespie"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0465607/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0637285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0312433/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0737216/","name":"Steven Rogers"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He handles the husband-to-a-celebrity role with a charm not seen since Eric Roberts in STAR 80.\n\nThe subject matter may cost the film at awards time, but it's still an excellent movie that you should definitely check out if you have any interest at all in the story.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200749,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-05","keywords":"ice skating,violence,abuse,female protagonist,ice skater","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer: I, Tonya","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4244617241","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVhNGQ1NzEtYmYyYi00YTUxLTk4MDMtMDZjOTYzNDA2MzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVhNGQ1NzEtYmYyYi00YTUxLTk4MDMtMDZjOTYzNDA2MzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding rises among the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband intervenes.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659221/","name":"Sebastian Stan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005049/","name":"Allison Janney"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0318916/","name":"Craig Gillespie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0465607/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0637285/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0312433/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0737216/","name":"Steven Rogers"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I found this a very good follow up to "Symmetry".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":505,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-08-18","keywords":"police inspector,murder,husband wife relationship,doctor","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161607/","name":"Andrzej Chyra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0162123/","name":"Magdalena Cielecka","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0327290/","name":"Robert Gonera"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1407454/","name":"Konrad Niewolski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0067099/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023778/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0107013/","name":"Igor Brejdygant"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.\n\nWhen they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.\n\nThe story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.\n\nThen there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.\n\nFantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

Thankfully, I was wrong.\n\nFrom the opening scene, the movie sucks you in with tension and unease. Cecilia (Elizabeth Moss) is trying to escape from her abusive boyfriend while he is asleep, and with practically no dialogue or exposition, we immediately understand the situation and feel for Moss' character. She's trapped in an abusive relationship and fears for her life. It's a testament to Whannell's deliberate direction, using visual cues to give us the information we need while slowly ratcheting up the suspense. The movie is not reliant on jump scares. There are a few, but they're 100% earned and actually effective because we care about the characters. The excellent score helps add to the atmosphere, alternating between pulsating ambience and melancholy orchestral bits.\n\nFrom the concise writing, likable characters, clever directing, a powerhouse lead performance, and a genuinely scary villain, The Invisible Man gets just about everything right. I suppose you could nitpick some of the logic, but that's missing the point. It's a film about gaining freedom from a toxic relationship, and Whannell knows exactly how to pace the story so that we don't spend too much time dwelling on potential plot holes. Overall, a gripping and expertly crafted psychological thriller.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":199609,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-02-27","keywords":"domestic abuse,psychological abuse,invisibility,invisibility suit,mad scientist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2623455001","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjU2NmQ3YjEtYmI1OC00OWVkLWEwZGQtYjYzMTAxMWI4YTBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjU2NmQ3YjEtYmI1OC00OWVkLWEwZGQtYjYzMTAxMWI4YTBlXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"What you can’t see can hurt you.

Perhaps writing/editting and starring in the film robbed him too much of objectivity when it came to actually watching this bit of a non-story. He portrays "Max", a young French-Canadian man who is about to emigrate to Australia. At a party with his childhood friends, he and handsome best pal Matt (Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas) get lumbered with starring in a video being made by one of their number's pesky younger sister. The scene involved the two of them kissing - something neither had done (as an adult) with a man before. What ensues is a slow, deliberately so, depiction of the complications that this kiss has on their relationship. "Matt" has a long term girlfriend, so his reconciliation with his "new" feelings for his friend take on a different guise from those of the single "Max" who has issues with his recovering addict mother. Sadly, though, too much of those repercussions are presumed on us by the director and not demonstrated to the audience. It doesn't need to be a cheesy traditional romance, nor a sex fest, but we are left to imagine or envisage that they want each other only because we know that's what the film is about - not because we are presented with much tangible, or even implied, sense of desire.

Perhaps writing/editting and starring in the film robbed him too much of objectivity when it came to actually watching this bit of a non-story. He portrays "Max", a young French-Canadian man who is about to emigrate to Australia. At a party with his childhood friends, he and handsome best pal Matt (Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas) get lumbered with starring in a video being made by one of their number's pesky younger sister. The scene involved the two of them kissing - something neither had done (as an adult) with a man before. What ensues is a slow, deliberately so, depiction of the complications that this kiss has on their relationship. "Matt" has a long term girlfriend, so his reconciliation with his "new" feelings for his friend take on a different guise from those of the single "Max" who has issues with his recovering addict mother. Sadly, though, too much of those repercussions are presumed on us by the director and not demonstrated to the audience. It doesn't need to be a cheesy traditional romance, nor a sex fest, but we are left to imagine or envisage that they want each other only because we know that's what the film is about - not because we are presented with much tangible, or even implied, sense of desire. Indeed the others in their group more readily flirt and banter than the two in the title. It doesn't have a beginning, middle and end - it just has a middle. A rather interestingly filmed and quite well put together middle, but a middle nonetheless. Certainly worth watching - I think Dolan has something about him - but I wanted more from the characters and the story - as it is I just felt like a rather unsatisfied observer.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6595,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-10-09","keywords":"gay character,friendship,kiss,in love with best friend,mother son relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707182105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNjNTgxYjYtNzI1OS00MzUwLWE5MTEtMjJhZDZhMTllZDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNjNTgxYjYtNzI1OS00MzUwLWE5MTEtMjJhZDZhMTllZDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8570499/","name":"Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2954178/","name":"Pier-Luc Funk"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0489666/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053578/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093053/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

As the movie begins they are on one of their walks, her short legs must move almost twice as fast as his. After they cross the bridge and get to a certain tree they turn around and head back. About 12 months later the movie ends the very same way.\n\nIn between Joan discovers a lump in one of her breasts and this starts a series of doctor visits, hospital visits, treatments, and making unexpected new friends. The movie examines the relationship between the long-time married couple, their devotion to each other, their working together to get past this big speed bump in life.\n\nThis is a good movie, we enjoyed it at home on DVD from our public library.

My wife and I are in a similar situation, older, retired, and long-time married. Our daily life and conversations are not that different from what is depicted here.\n\nLesley Manville (early 60s) is Joan and Liam Neeson (late 60s) is her husband Tom. As the movie begins they are on one of their walks, her short legs must move almost twice as fast as his. After they cross the bridge and get to a certain tree they turn around and head back. About 12 months later the movie ends the very same way.\n\nIn between Joan discovers a lump in one of her breasts and this starts a series of doctor visits, hospital visits, treatments, and making unexpected new friends. The movie examines the relationship between the long-time married couple, their devotion to each other, their working together to get past this big speed bump in life.\n\nThis is a good movie, we enjoyed it at home on DVD from our public library. Romantic attraction is usually what gets a couple together but ordinary love is what keeps them together.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3805,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-12-06","keywords":"cancer,middle aged couple,chemotherapy,gay couple,hospital","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1637400345","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZlZjUzZjYtN2I3MC00MWQzLWI4Y2YtNWE1M2ZhMzk4ZGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGZlZjUzZjYtN2I3MC00MWQzLWI4Y2YtNWE1M2ZhMzk4ZGM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Joan and Tom have been married for many years.

While most people dismissed The Thin Red Line as the `other' World War II movie of 1998, it's actually a very different kind of film - the film itself is not hurt by similarity to Ryan but was hurt commercially due to the misconception. It's easy to forget that Red was nominated for seven Oscars.  This is an extraordinary film that can stand well on its own next to Ryan.\n\nSaving Private Ryan was significant in that it visually depicted war in a realistic, gritty way.  The Thin Red Line's focus is more philosophical. It is about the contradiction between the beauty of nature and the destructive nature of men.  The movie cuts continuously between the external struggle of American GIs fighting to take a crucial hill from Japanese occupation on Guadalcanal - and more importantly, the internal chaos of war as every man tries to come to his own terms about matters such as morals, death, God, and love.\n\nUnlike in Saving Private Ryan, there is nothing patriotic about this movie. In fact, there probably has never been a more anti-war film.  The fighting men here are disillusioned, lost, and frightened.  They don't fight for their country or "democracy" - they fight because they have to.  The only priorities are survival, and - for the more humane - caring for their comrades.  Renowned composer Hans Zimmer - who won an Oscar nomination for his work-captures the grim mood perfectly and allows us to hear the men's thoughts.\n\nThe characters are portrayed by a strong ensemble cast.  Acting is uniformly excellent, especially Nick Nolte as Colonel Tall, who is the unfeeling commander of the ground offensive on Guadalcanal. Thoroughly unlikable, he is the closest thing to a villain in the movie.  After studying war for an untold number of years, Tall sees Guadalcanal as his chance to prove himself and move up in the ranks - the men are only a tool to accomplish this goal and expendable.  In one crucial scene, he orders a captain (played by Elias Koteas, in another outstanding role) to lead his men to a frontal assault against a Japanese controlled hill.  When the captain suggests a more logical alternative, the colonel screams: "You are not gonna take your men around in the jungle to avoid a goddamn fight!"  To this, the captain replies, `I've lived with these men, sir, for two and a half years and I will not order them all to their deaths.'  Later, when the hill is taken, he is dismissed of his duties as Tall sees him as a threat to the successful achievement of his goal.  Certainly, not every commander must have been that coldhearted and selfish, but surely some were, though not necessarily to that extreme.\n\nWhile the acting is very good, much of the cast is relatively unknown and it can initially be hard to distinguish the characters from each other as they may appear to be very similar.  They are all about the same age, have dirt smeared over their faces, and wear helmets and the same military garb. Also, the stars in this movie have very small roles.  George Clooney and John Travolta are credited with starring roles while really little more than extras - clearly for marketing purposes.  You will not see more than two minutes of each.\n\nOne of the main themes of the movie is the contrast between nature and men's destructiveness in war.  The director, Terrence Malick, hired cinematographer John Toll to capture this on camera, and towards achieving that goal they couldn't have been more successful.  The almost surreal scenery is nothing short of stunning and has the same visual impact as any special effect.  The beauty of nature is always present, even when it is a setting for battle of destruction, and death.\n\nThough the battle scenes fall short of the frightening realism in Saving Private Ryan, they are heads and soldiers above every previous attempt. One truly gets the sense that war is a chaotic, often hopeless environment where it is only a matter of luck whether you survive or get killed.\n\n `How did we lose the good that was given us? Or let it slip away? Scatter it carelessly ... trade it for what has no worth?'  The film is filled with such poetic questions as to which there are no real answers.  This is definitely not a party movie.  There isn't anything uplifting about it - it is downright depressing.  Asides from entertainment value, however, this is a film that makes you think.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":181622,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"1999-03-10","keywords":"battle,tropical island,jungle,guadalcanal,hill","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Thin Red Line","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1266944281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5MjgxZjYtMDBiZC00ZDliLTg5YzUtNWY1MThkMWE3ZGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM5MjgxZjYtMDBiZC00ZDliLTg5YzUtNWY1MThkMWE3ZGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Criterion trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001029/","name":"Jim Caviezel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000560/","name":"Nick Nolte"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036867/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029574/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0428296/","name":"James Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000517/","name":"Terrence Malick"}],"duration":"PT2H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The X-Files will forever be remembered as a true hit TV show, and a breakout accomplishment for Fox. Its survived cast changes, location moves, ups and downs in ratings, and years of airing. I think I speak for everyone when I say that it has been a thrill. Chris Carter has created one of the most defining shows of the '90s. People that don't even watch the show know what it is, and EVERYONE knows who Fox Mulder and Dana Scully are, whether they've ever seen one episode or not. The show brought on a whole new level of TV entertainment in 1993, with its different, moody atmosphere, intriguing lead characters, and mind-bending plots. I admit, while watching most of the episodes, I thought, "This isn't very scary...", but then I payed attention to the detail and it got so good...the lighting, the sets...even when Mulder and Scully are outside (which is often), the sky is hardly ever sunny and bright, but rather dark and shadowy. The details on these things are terrific alone. And Chris Carter has also managed to create intense torture for the fans by forever dragging out the "Mulder and Scully in love" idea. People used to tune in to see when those two would kiss, and they had alot of fun with that, especially in the feature film. But a true sign of integrity for the show is the amount of truth in it. While the show is about the paranormal, and truth in it seems ironic, the show knows what the heck it's talking about. Every word from Scully's mouth is based on actual science. And unlike other FBI shows, The X-Files shows the FBI like it really is--not some tired cliche, but REAL people. And whenever someone, whether a fan or not, hears anything referring to aliens, they immediately think of little green men with small bodies, big heads, and large eyes...all courtesy of The X-Files. In short, this amazing television series has affected so many people. I feel blessed to have grown up with this show, rather than being born after it, doomed to see it in reruns.

Literally making one horrible decision after another. Trying my best not to blame the actor for terrible writing, but even his acting is lacking. I know that's harsh, but...damn.

Now, I never really write reviews because everyone's opinions vary distinctly and it seems kind of pointless to try to show them the "magic" of a certain movie if they refuse to see it, or to tell them how horrible it was as though I think that I'm really that much better of a director, writer, or whatever. But after reading such lines as "if you liked this film, you know nothing about film" and so on, I simply couldn't contain myself.\n\nFirst off, let me start by saying that I in no way respect Eminem as an artist. I personally despise rap and the "culture" that it creates in society full of pumped up punks trying to act tough or "hard", as they struggle in a societal structure that they perpetrate upon themselves. In fewer words: I hate listening to constant bitching and dated slogans about bitches and benjamins. And after hearing about Eminem's wife-beating and all around socially retarded mentality, I wanted less to do with 8 Mile on the probability that he may be receiving a percentage of the ticket sales. But, after a time, I ended up renting it at Blockbuster for the hell of it, at least to give it a chance. I popped it in, and I was all set and ready to hate every minute of it... but ended up sitting through a movie that actually left me with a smile on my face.\n\nFor those who've not yet seen the film, I'll give some background of the story. Eminem plays Rabbit, a struggling Detroit freestyle rapper trying desperately to make a name for himself in the bustling Detroit underground music scene. Kim Basinger plays his alcoholic mother, miserable and bitter of where her life has ended up (in a trailer park, barely able to make rent or take care of herself). Mekhi Phifer plays Future, Rabbit's best ally and, in some ways, his father figure; playing the role of the protective, guidance providing, loving role-model. Conflict stirs in Rabbit's life as, through his bouts with stage fright and homelessness, he begins to question his ability to make it in the world of music as he wishes to; nearly becoming content to simply abide life as he knows it. But through his experiences and how he works through his own personal problems, he starts to see his path better and more clearly.\n\nNow, I grew up in a very small town. A farming community in the middle of nowhere, where my nearest neighbors where half a mile away. I hated every minute that I was there and felt trapped in a world there that I didn't feel welcome in or a part of. Aspiring to become a filmmaker when everyone tells you you're an idiot for even thinking of it isn't easy. Which is probably why I related so much with this film. Rabbit's own experiences as well as his mother's criticism of him and his life make him feel trapped within his station of life, feeling as though his own specific voice isn't being heard, and trying desperately to change that. Anyone who doesn't recognize this is someone that I would generally think was lucky enough to not be born into this type of community structure with ideals that conflicted with the generally accepted norm; as it's thoroughly developed throughout the story. And the story... the story develops nicely over time. It never feels rushed or thrown together hastily just to make a movie with the star power of Eminem. That COULD have happened, and it COULD have made a lot of money for everyone involved. Instead, a director was chosen who understands pacing of a story, importance of cinematic elements throughout a story (i.e.: not just putting actors on screen to say their lines and that's it), and who just understands the elements of how to tell a good story on film. They even gathered a supporting cast of actual actors who've proven themselves as true artists within their craft in the past, and didn't just hand off the part to one of the executive producer's nieces or nephews or whatever. Scott Silver's loose adaptation of the life of Eminem was tweaked just enough to skew from Eminem's specific life, and become more universal in it's ability to portray a struggle that millions of artists go through around the world. All of these elements, along with my surprise at the actual acting ability of Eminem, combine to tell a story that feels deeply personal while very universal, and can be related to by more people than simply myself. It tells a story of never settling for what you can get just because it's easier, and that hard work and dedication are the only ways to dig your way out of a perpetual cycle that you may find yourself a part of.\n\nTo close, this is by no means the best movie that I've ever seen. Not even close. But that doesn't mean that it's not a prime example of filmmaking at it's best. A movie doesn't have to be the best thing since disco in order to be any good... it simply has to have a purpose and a message, and portray those with clarity and honesty; which this movie accomplishes in spades.\n\nSee this movie."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268350,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2002-11-08","keywords":"self expression,competition,rap music,hip hop,proles","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"8 Mile","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi615776537","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlOWUwNDUtZWM1Mi00Zjc3LTk1NjAtMGU1OTNjMGY3OTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlOWUwNDUtZWM1Mi00Zjc3LTk1NjAtMGU1OTNjMGY3OTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "March 18th""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004896/","name":"Eminem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005261/","name":"Brittany Murphy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000107/","name":"Kim Basinger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000436/","name":"Curtis Hanson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106989/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798788/","name":"Scott Silver"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

All of these elements, along with my surprise at the actual acting ability of Eminem, combine to tell a story that feels deeply personal while very universal, and can be related to by more people than simply myself. It tells a story of never settling for what you can get just because it's easier, and that hard work and dedication are the only ways to dig your way out of a perpetual cycle that you may find yourself a part of.\n\nTo close, this is by no means the best movie that I've ever seen. Not even close. But that doesn't mean that it's not a prime example of filmmaking at it's best. A movie doesn't have to be the best thing since disco in order to be any good... it simply has to have a purpose and a message, and portray those with clarity and honesty; which this movie accomplishes in spades.\n\nSee this movie.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268350,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2002-11-08","keywords":"self expression,competition,rap music,hip hop,proles","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"8 Mile","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi615776537","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlOWUwNDUtZWM1Mi00Zjc3LTk1NjAtMGU1OTNjMGY3OTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTdlOWUwNDUtZWM1Mi00Zjc3LTk1NjAtMGU1OTNjMGY3OTVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre, "March 18th"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004896/","name":"Eminem","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005261/","name":"Brittany Murphy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000107/","name":"Kim Basinger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000436/","name":"Curtis Hanson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0106989/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798788/","name":"Scott Silver"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">Zmarły w 2009 roku Marek Edelman był ostatnim przywódcą powstania w getcie warszawskim. Przed swoją śmiercią odpowiedział na pytanie, czy w getcie była miłość i jak ona się przejawiała. Film jest odpowiedzią na książkę Marka Edelmana i Pauli Sawickiej o tym samym tytule, która zawiera wspomnienia mężczyzny. Przy jego scenariuszu współpracowała Agnieszka Holland, a jego fabularyzowane sceny współreżyserował Andrzej Wajda.</desc>

I will give it a 9 Out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":777302,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5,"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2002-09-25","keywords":"pianist,holocaust,survival,nazi occupied poland,person in a wheelchair falls from height","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Pianist","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi988938521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ4MWQzNDEtYmI4Zi00NmY0LWEwYTEtZTg4MmQ3MDM2YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ4MWQzNDEtYmI4Zi00NmY0LWEwYTEtZTg4MmQ3MDM2YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Focus Features","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004778/","name":"Adrien Brody","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470981/","name":"Thomas Kretschmann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277975/","name":"Frank Finlay"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024473/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030304/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053177/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0844262/","name":"Wladyslaw Szpilman"],"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Co-writer, director, and starring Julie Delpy! She's Violette, in the fashion industry. She meets a fisherman, and accepts an invitation to a party. Turns out he's really a nice computer guy, and they start dating. But there's a hitch... Violette's son Lolo (Vincent Lacoste) doesn't like the new guy, so he starts doing things to bust them up. And he makes his own mother so paranoid, she starts acting weird around the new guy, JeanRene (Dany Boon). After this goes on for a while, we can only hope that Violette stops blaming JeanRene. Of course, the son is loving every minute of the misunderstandings and screw-ups. Will mom ever catch on? Delpy was an actor for YEARS before she began directing. Shared oscar nominations for Before Midnight and Before Sunset. This one is okay. Like a (really long) episode of three's company. So many misunderstandings... orchestrated by the son.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3971,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-10-28","keywords":"oedipal complex,breastfeeding a baby,breast feeding,breasts pulled out,paris france","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer for Lolo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi53064473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDY1MzcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE5MTQ3NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDY1MzcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE5MTQ3NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A film by Julie Delpy"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200702/","name":"Dany Boon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3228320/","name":"Vincent Lacoste"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170513/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0261946/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3032208/","name":"Eugénie Grandval"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Co-writer, director, and starring Julie Delpy! She's Violette, in the fashion industry. She meets a fisherman, and accepts an invitation to a party. Turns out he's really a nice computer guy, and they start dating. But there's a hitch... Violette's son Lolo (Vincent Lacoste) doesn't like the new guy, so he starts doing things to bust them up. And he makes his own mother so paranoid, she starts acting weird around the new guy, JeanRene (Dany Boon). After this goes on for a while, we can only hope that Violette stops blaming JeanRene. Of course, the son is loving every minute of the misunderstandings and screw-ups. Will mom ever catch on? Delpy was an actor for YEARS before she began directing. Shared oscar nominations for Before Midnight and Before Sunset. This one is okay. Like a (really long) episode of three's company. So many misunderstandings... orchestrated by the son.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3971,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-10-28","keywords":"oedipal complex,breastfeeding a baby,breast feeding,breasts pulled out,paris france","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer for Lolo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi53064473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDY1MzcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE5MTQ3NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDY1MzcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE5MTQ3NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A film by Julie Delpy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200702/","name":"Dany Boon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3228320/","name":"Vincent Lacoste"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170513/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0261946/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3032208/","name":"Eugénie Grandval"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Here the gremlins are real, they are dangerous, and a super woman of sorts has to save the day.\n\nChloë Grace Moretz ten years earlier starred in Kick Ass, another movie not to be taken too seriously. Here she is Maude Garrett who boards a military flight out of New Zealand in 1943, presenting "orders" that she is supposed to be there with a top secret package.\n\nThis movie is about as real as the old Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner cartoons.

This movie does that old TV series proud.\n\nMost of the very bad ratings here are given by viewers who somehow took this for a serious movie. It is not. It is a spoof of sorts, of the competent hard-working women of WW2, and the old signs cautioning workers to avoid gremlins. Here the gremlins are real, they are dangerous, and a super woman of sorts has to save the day.\n\nChloë Grace Moretz ten years earlier starred in Kick Ass, another movie not to be taken too seriously. Here she is Maude Garrett who boards a military flight out of New Zealand in 1943, presenting "orders" that she is supposed to be there with a top secret package.\n\nThis movie is about as real as the old Bugs Bunny and Roadrunner cartoons. I was invested all the way and found it to be entertaining, fun escapism. That's all it is. Moretz is great.\n\nAt home on DVD from my public library, my wife skipped.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22359,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","War"],"datePublished":"2021-01-01","keywords":"boeing b 17 flying fortress,world war two,electronic music score,1940s,year 1943","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3659972889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThlYWYxY2UtZTQxMy00ZjkyLWExNDMtMjc4MDAzMThmZTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThlYWYxY2UtZTQxMy00ZjkyLWExNDMtMjc4MDAzMThmZTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A female WWII pilot traveling with top secret documents on a B-17 Flying Fortress encounters an evil presence on board the flight.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1631269/","name":"Chloë Grace Moretz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3538718/","name":"Nick Robinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3872230/","name":"Beulah Koale"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1755396/","name":"Roseanne Liang"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0308127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0628817/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0484840/","name":"Max Landis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1755396/","name":"Roseanne Liang"],"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Also, I was surprised to see the voice for the old man in the train with the newspaper was done by late Andrzej Wajda.\n\nFinal thoughts, the film is a nightmare that gets under your skin visually and plays deep into the consciousness. I would say the film clearly owes a debt to David Lynch and this is not to criticise or say that I didn't love the experience. I did and it was Lynchian, sometimes it reminded me of demo tapes album art from 90s grindcore bands, a little of Ujichaa, little of David Shrigley or Roland Topor, and some Bill Plympton vibes all mixed into one that in several places is close to the grotesque and beautiful.

To the fans who possess a love for surrealism and adore the aforementioned artists, check it out I highly recommend that you do so.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":695,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"genre":["Animation","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-03-05","keywords":"hero","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi642563609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlNmYyMDItYjdmNS00NTJmLTkyYWQtNTNjM2RkMTFkNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlNmYyMDItYjdmNS00NTJmLTkyYWQtNTNjM2RkMTFkNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417370/","name":"Krystyna Janda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161607/","name":"Andrzej Chyra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652292/","name":"Maja Ostaszewska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1295507/","name":"Mariusz Wilczynski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0799710/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0723136/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0704662/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1295507/","name":"Mariusz Wilczynski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1294751/","name":"Agnieszka Scibior"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed.

After experiencing the film earlier today, I can say it was a tremendous experience.\n\nI felt the first thirty minutes or so were the strongest of the entire film, plunging us into the despair and conflicts of various characters with adroit narrative thrust so that not a moment feels wasted or redundant. Two of the three (in my opinion) gut-wrenching musical numbers come in this section- Anne Hathaway's "I Dreamed a Dream" (which, if I recall correctly, was filmed largely in a single take) and Hugh Jackman's "Who Am I?". I can only speculate but, compared to the stage version, being able to take in every facial nuance in the film version seems to make the moments of crescendo and soaring strings pack so much more of an emotional punch. Both Hathaway and Jackman also deliver top-notch performances, and it's hard to imagine anyone else fitting the role of Valjean as well as Jackman. \n\nThematically, the film also shines in this section. Here we are introduced to the major theme of forgiveness for the first time, through Fantine we tap into maternal bonds as well as disillusionment, and Valjean's struggles explore the conflict between not only public and private selves but also reconciling our own personal interests with what is morally correct.\n\nIt seemed curious to me that the bleakest moments of the film (at least for me) came at the beginning, which made it impossible for the film to regain that same sense of gravitas as the story progressed. While the remainder of the film was certainly entertaining, it felt both less emotionally involving and less taut than the beginning.\n\nHelena Bonham Carter and Sacha Baron Cohen provided some much appreciated comic relief, but their antics seemed oddly out of place in this film at times, and often left me feeling as though I were watching Sweeney Todd again. Russell Crowe, while certainly no vocal powerhouse, did a fine job as Javert, although I found his final number to be oddly anti-climactic. The younger actors gave fine performances as well, with Samantha Barks demonstrating the most potential and Eddie Redmayne surprisingly delivering the final gut-wrenching number, "Empty Chairs at Empty Tables." The thematic exploration of the rise and fall of idealism makes this sequence especially poignant.\n\nArtistically, Les Miserables is a feast. The production design is top-notch, with meticulously crafted sets and props. Makeup and costumes are definitely noteworthy as well. Many of the shots of Paris have an artificially beautiful aesthetic to them, and every crane shot adds a sense of beauty and scope to the piece. Editorially, the film makes takes advantage of cuts to characters in different locations or concurrent events which would not have been possible in the stage version of Les Mis.\n\nOne minor complaint from a filmmaking perspective was cinematographer Danny Cohen's method of framing characters. Conventional cinematography typically frames actors so that their faces are demarcating either the left or right third of the screen, with the camera positioned so that their subjects are turned towards the remaining two thirds of the screen. In Les Miserables (though thankfully not to the same extent as in The King's Speech), a few times the characters are positioned so that they are facing the other direction- the edge of the screen. Though I imagine the filmmakers were attempting to add visual flourish to the film, I found this technique oddly jarring, drawing me out of the film and making me conscious I was watching a movie.\n\nThe film does regain some levity in its rousing finale, which ties the film together in plot, theme, and song. Despite the minor issues I had with the film, I found it to be a hard-hitting and rousing work of art. I could probably sum it up best by noting that this is the first movie I've been to where even old men were wiping their teary eyes by the time the credits rolled.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":319889,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Musical","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-01-02","keywords":"rebellion,france,orphan,parole,barricade","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winner: Best Supporting Actress","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2712512281","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5ODYxODY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3OTc3OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM5ODYxODY1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjk3OTc3OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch a TV trailer for Les Miserables."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0393799/","name":"Tom Hooper"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103961/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0629933/","name":"William Nicholson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0098842/","name":"Alain Boublil"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0774744/","name":"Claude-Michel Schönberg"}],"duration":"PT2H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The rest goes to hubby-at-times Jeff Gillooly, played by Sebastian Stan. He handles the husband-to-a-celebrity role with a charm not seen since Eric Roberts in STAR 80.\n\nThe subject matter may cost the film at awards time, but it's still an excellent movie that you should definitely check out if you have any interest at all in the story.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":200749,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-05","keywords":"ice skating,violence,abuse,female protagonist,ice skater","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer: I, Tonya","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4244617241","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVhNGQ1NzEtYmYyYi00YTUxLTk4MDMtMDZjOTYzNDA2MzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmVhNGQ1NzEtYmYyYi00YTUxLTk4MDMtMDZjOTYzNDA2MzMwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRzdGFzaWVr._V1_.jpg","description":"Competitive ice skater Tonya Harding rises among the ranks at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships, but her future in the activity is thrown into doubt when her ex-husband intervenes."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1659221/","name":"Sebastian Stan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005049/","name":"Allison Janney"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0318916/","name":"Craig Gillespie"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0465607/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0637285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0312433/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0737216/","name":"Steven Rogers"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The war is cruel and demanding for both sides, and especially for those caught in between as the DUI-ed headmaster of Popasna School N3 who launches a string of interconnected novellas.\n\nAfter the third episode when the gates of the hell seem to have widely open, you are plunged into the seemingly innocent mild road incident when a strayed hen is killed. Would you expect what you see from a pair of peasants whose rusted shaving razors are piled in a filth sink?\n\nIt is still evident that the dramaturgic power of Vorozhbit, given her experience, still dominates over her cinematography. Details are gripping as the aftertaste and anticipation of more to come from this ascented star of Ukraine's cinema and theater.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":284,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-05-20","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7223776/","name":"Zoya Baranovskaya"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11937432/","name":"Oksana Cherkashyna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11745645/","name":"Vladimir Gurin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3770838/","name":"Natalya Vorozhbit"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0673519/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0763401/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3770838/","name":"Natalya Vorozhbit"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The war is cruel and demanding for both sides, and especially for those caught in between as the DUI-ed headmaster of Popasna School N3 who launches a string of interconnected novellas.\n\nAfter the third episode when the gates of the hell seem to have widely open, you are plunged into the seemingly innocent mild road incident when a strayed hen is killed. Would you expect what you see from a pair of peasants whose rusted shaving razors are piled in a filth sink?\n\nIt is still evident that the dramaturgic power of Vorozhbit, given her experience, still dominates over her cinematography. Details are gripping as the aftertaste and anticipation of more to come from this ascented star of Ukraine's cinema and theater.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":284,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-05-20","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7223776/","name":"Zoya Baranovskaya","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11937432/","name":"Oksana Cherkashyna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11745645/","name":"Vladimir Gurin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3770838/","name":"Natalya Vorozhbit"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0673519/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0763401/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3770838/","name":"Natalya Vorozhbit"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

True, good, story-telling.  Sure, kids will love it, but the film isn't really aimed at them like most kid movies are. It is complicated, eerie, beautiful, and intelligent... most of all, mystical. I reccomend this to anyone seriously interested in film, especially fantasy... not to be missed!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":64689,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1982-12-17","keywords":"puppetry,magical crystal,crystal shard,cult favorite,puppet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi629389593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDEzMjBjM2QtN2Y0Mi00ZGY4LTgzZTYtYTQwZWZiYzIyMjc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDEzMjBjM2QtN2Y0Mi00ZGY4LTgzZTYtYTQwZWZiYzIyMjc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rediscover the age of wonder inspired by Jim Henson's groundbreaking vision.

The middle third of the movie is hard to watch at times but fortunately the final third starts to bring some healing.\n\nGood movie, my wife and I watched it at home on DVD from our public library.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7600,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-08-21","keywords":"based on young adult novel,schizophrenia,hallucination,hospital,restraint","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3428105753","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFiNDU4MzQtOGIzMS00ZGRmLWIzNTYtYmZjNmFhOGZlYzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjFiNDU4MzQtOGIzMS00ZGRmLWIzNTYtYmZjNmFhOGZlYzRhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A teenager coping with paranoid schizophrenia hopes his new experimental drug treatment will help him navigate high school and the outside world.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4055138/","name":"Charlie Plummer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000412/","name":"Andy Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5347988/","name":"Taylor Russell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0294457/","name":"Thor Freudenthal"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0811450/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0192696/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4550950/","name":"Nick Naveda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9649443/","name":"Julia Walton"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Could you be a bit more specific? Assuming that you're not talking about making a trip to Nepal, there are still many ways to interpret your request besides seeing the 2015 docudrama. The world's tallest mountain is the center of the story in a 1998 documentary, a 2007 TV mini-series, a 2014-2015 TV series and another film project still in development. All of these treatments are simply titled, "Everest". More to the point, 2015's "Everest" (PG-13, 2:01) re-tells the specific story from the '98 doc and a 1997 TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest"), but tells it more vividly than ever before.\n\nThe '97, '98 and 2015 films all take us along for doomed expeditions up the tallest peak in the Himalayas in May 1996, as told in at least five books by survivors, most famously in journalist Jon Krakauer's 1997 best-seller "Into Thin Air", which is the primary basis for the screenplay of 2015's "Everest". As the film tells us early on, by the late 1980s, climbing Everest had transitioned from the domain of adventurers like George Mallory and Edmund Hillary with minimal equipment to a tourist destination for thrill-seekers with little climbing experience, but enough money to buy state-of-the-art equipment, stay in established base camps, and hire local Sherpas as guides and, in some cases, to carry the climber's gear and cook meals. But as the films about the 1996 climbs (and subsequent major avalanches) have shown, no amount of money, gear, help or even experience can insulate anyone from the dangers inherent in this climb. "The last word," as one character in the 2015 film says, "always belongs to the mountain." "Everest" follows two of the expeditions which suffered tragic losses on the mountain on May 10-11, 1996. Rival expedition leaders Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), of the company Adventure Consultants, and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), of Mountain Madness, decide to work together due to the large number of people trying to reach the peak on May 10th. The main focus of the story is Hall's team, which includes people with a wide range of personal backgrounds. Hall is an experienced New Zealand mountaineer who has already climbed to the top of Everest four times, including once with his wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), who has stayed in New Zealand this time due to her pregnancy. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is a mailman who attempted Everest once before and wants to reach the summit as a way of inspiring schoolchildren back home in Washington state. Yasuko Namba is a 47-year-old Japanese woman who has already climbed the other six of the famed Seven Summits and wants to become the oldest woman to reach the top of Everest. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is an adventurous Texan who is also pursuing the goal of the Seven Summits, but has lied to his wife, Peach (Robin Wright), about his current trip to Everest. Jon Krakauer is a writer for "Outside" magazine, but has never been on a climb above 8000m. Several of the people portrayed in this film died on Everest and others barely escaped with their lives.\n\n"Everest" is much more than a high-altitude adventure movie or disaster flick. Besides learning about the personal backgrounds of the characters, we follow them on their entire adventure, from beginning to end, learning a good bit about mountain climbing along the way. One of the first things we learn is that, to these people, summit is a verb. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. "Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying," he says. This group understands all that, but they've put their trust in the honest, personable and level-headed Hall. And they've paid him a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest – and safely back down. At base camp, Hall and his friend and colleague, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and their fellow Adventure Consultants employees, teach, coach and take care of their customers, including Hall taking them on some practice climbs. In spite of the danger and discomfort that everyone experiences even going only partially up the mountain, they're all looking forward to the real thing. They know they'll be cold, exhausted and scared, while having trouble breathing and facing the unpredictability of the mountain, but they didn't come this far to quit. Their experiences turn out much worse than anything any of them could have imagined.\n\n"Everest" is a fascinating and gripping adventure. Like other movies about mountain climbing, this one fails to give a satisfactory reason for why these people risk their lives for little more than a great view and bragging rights, but it's clear that there are a variety of justifications within the group. The script depicts this climb as an extremely risky venture, but allows us to marvel at the courage, determination and, in some cases, self-sacrifice of these people. The character development (thanks to a great script and a terrific cast) is outstanding and the cinematography is as impressive as you'd expect (especially in IMAX 3-D). The suffering of the climbers (even when things are going according to plan), the thrilling moments (when circumstances throw the plan into chaos), the heartbreak and the small victories along the way all make us feel like we're right there on that mountain. The hardships and the tragedies of this expedition are sometimes shot and edited oddly, but are never exploitive. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur brings us an engaging, eye-opening and beautiful film that most are likely to appreciate.

Could you be a bit more specific? Assuming that you're not talking about making a trip to Nepal, there are still many ways to interpret your request besides seeing the 2015 docudrama. The world's tallest mountain is the center of the story in a 1998 documentary, a 2007 TV mini-series, a 2014-2015 TV series and another film project still in development. All of these treatments are simply titled, "Everest". More to the point, 2015's "Everest" (PG-13, 2:01) re-tells the specific story from the '98 doc and a 1997 TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest"), but tells it more vividly than ever before.\n\nThe '97, '98 and 2015 films all take us along for doomed expeditions up the tallest peak in the Himalayas in May 1996, as told in at least five books by survivors, most famously in journalist Jon Krakauer's 1997 best-seller "Into Thin Air", which is the primary basis for the screenplay of 2015's "Everest". As the film tells us early on, by the late 1980s, climbing Everest had transitioned from the domain of adventurers like George Mallory and Edmund Hillary with minimal equipment to a tourist destination for thrill-seekers with little climbing experience, but enough money to buy state-of-the-art equipment, stay in established base camps, and hire local Sherpas as guides and, in some cases, to carry the climber's gear and cook meals. But as the films about the 1996 climbs (and subsequent major avalanches) have shown, no amount of money, gear, help or even experience can insulate anyone from the dangers inherent in this climb. "The last word," as one character in the 2015 film says, "always belongs to the mountain." "Everest" follows two of the expeditions which suffered tragic losses on the mountain on May 10-11, 1996. Rival expedition leaders Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), of the company Adventure Consultants, and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), of Mountain Madness, decide to work together due to the large number of people trying to reach the peak on May 10th. The main focus of the story is Hall's team, which includes people with a wide range of personal backgrounds. Hall is an experienced New Zealand mountaineer who has already climbed to the top of Everest four times, including once with his wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), who has stayed in New Zealand this time due to her pregnancy. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is a mailman who attempted Everest once before and wants to reach the summit as a way of inspiring schoolchildren back home in Washington state. Yasuko Namba is a 47-year-old Japanese woman who has already climbed the other six of the famed Seven Summits and wants to become the oldest woman to reach the top of Everest. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is an adventurous Texan who is also pursuing the goal of the Seven Summits, but has lied to his wife, Peach (Robin Wright), about his current trip to Everest. Jon Krakauer is a writer for "Outside" magazine, but has never been on a climb above 8000m. Several of the people portrayed in this film died on Everest and others barely escaped with their lives.\n\n"Everest" is much more than a high-altitude adventure movie or disaster flick. Besides learning about the personal backgrounds of the characters, we follow them on their entire adventure, from beginning to end, learning a good bit about mountain climbing along the way. One of the first things we learn is that, to these people, summit is a verb. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. "Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying," he says. This group understands all that, but they've put their trust in the honest, personable and level-headed Hall. And they've paid him a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest – and safely back down. At base camp, Hall and his friend and colleague, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and their fellow Adventure Consultants employees, teach, coach and take care of their customers, including Hall taking them on some practice climbs. In spite of the danger and discomfort that everyone experiences even going only partially up the mountain, they're all looking forward to the real thing. They know they'll be cold, exhausted and scared, while having trouble breathing and facing the unpredictability of the mountain, but they didn't come this far to quit. Their experiences turn out much worse than anything any of them could have imagined.\n\n"Everest" is a fascinating and gripping adventure. Like other movies about mountain climbing, this one fails to give a satisfactory reason for why these people risk their lives for little more than a great view and bragging rights, but it's clear that there are a variety of justifications within the group. The script depicts this climb as an extremely risky venture, but allows us to marvel at the courage, determination and, in some cases, self-sacrifice of these people.

The hardships and the tragedies of this expedition are sometimes shot and edited oddly, but are never exploitive.

This was a very good movie, Tom Cruise was good in the lead role, the several one-liners were very cleaver and kept a sense of humor in a plot with plenty of violence and too close for comfort realism.

So like many, I read where the "serious" fans were disappointed that Tom Cruise was picked to portray this iconic hero. To them I say, so what, did you watch this movie? In truth Tom Cruise is very good in this role, the movie is fast paced and action packed, the writing is cleaver and spot on, so to those who would continue to pan this movie I say lighten up and relax. This was a very good movie, Tom Cruise was good in the lead role, the several one-liners were very cleaver and kept a sense of humor in a plot with plenty of violence and too close for comfort realism. This movie was good, it was entertaining, well acted, and should be viewed and enjoyed by all who watch it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":323088,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-12-26","keywords":"sniper,coma,quarry,pittsburgh pennsylvania,heads knocked together","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1158194201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzA4NjU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4MzI2OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI2NzA4NjU0NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDM4MzI2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A homicide investigator digs deeper into a case involving a trained military sniper who shot five random victims.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0683253/","name":"Rosamund Pike","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0420955/","name":"Richard Jenkins"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0769768/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1676193/","name":"Lee Child","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"],"duration":"PT2H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Could you be a bit more specific? Assuming that you're not talking about making a trip to Nepal, there are still many ways to interpret your request besides seeing the 2015 docudrama. The world's tallest mountain is the center of the story in a 1998 documentary, a 2007 TV mini-series, a 2014-2015 TV series and another film project still in development. All of these treatments are simply titled, "Everest". More to the point, 2015's "Everest" (PG-13, 2:01) re-tells the specific story from the '98 doc and a 1997 TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest"), but tells it more vividly than ever before.\n\nThe '97, '98 and 2015 films all take us along for doomed expeditions up the tallest peak in the Himalayas in May 1996, as told in at least five books by survivors, most famously in journalist Jon Krakauer's 1997 best-seller "Into Thin Air", which is the primary basis for the screenplay of 2015's "Everest". As the film tells us early on, by the late 1980s, climbing Everest had transitioned from the domain of adventurers like George Mallory and Edmund Hillary with minimal equipment to a tourist destination for thrill-seekers with little climbing experience, but enough money to buy state-of-the-art equipment, stay in established base camps, and hire local Sherpas as guides and, in some cases, to carry the climber's gear and cook meals. But as the films about the 1996 climbs (and subsequent major avalanches) have shown, no amount of money, gear, help or even experience can insulate anyone from the dangers inherent in this climb. "The last word," as one character in the 2015 film says, "always belongs to the mountain." "Everest" follows two of the expeditions which suffered tragic losses on the mountain on May 10-11, 1996. Rival expedition leaders Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), of the company Adventure Consultants, and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), of Mountain Madness, decide to work together due to the large number of people trying to reach the peak on May 10th. The main focus of the story is Hall's team, which includes people with a wide range of personal backgrounds. Hall is an experienced New Zealand mountaineer who has already climbed to the top of Everest four times, including once with his wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), who has stayed in New Zealand this time due to her pregnancy. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is a mailman who attempted Everest once before and wants to reach the summit as a way of inspiring schoolchildren back home in Washington state. Yasuko Namba is a 47-year-old Japanese woman who has already climbed the other six of the famed Seven Summits and wants to become the oldest woman to reach the top of Everest. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is an adventurous Texan who is also pursuing the goal of the Seven Summits, but has lied to his wife, Peach (Robin Wright), about his current trip to Everest. Jon Krakauer is a writer for "Outside" magazine, but has never been on a climb above 8000m. Several of the people portrayed in this film died on Everest and others barely escaped with their lives.\n\n"Everest" is much more than a high-altitude adventure movie or disaster flick. Besides learning about the personal backgrounds of the characters, we follow them on their entire adventure, from beginning to end, learning a good bit about mountain climbing along the way. One of the first things we learn is that, to these people, summit is a verb. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. "Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying," he says. This group understands all that, but they've put their trust in the honest, personable and level-headed Hall. And they've paid him a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest – and safely back down. At base camp, Hall and his friend and colleague, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and their fellow Adventure Consultants employees, teach, coach and take care of their customers, including Hall taking them on some practice climbs. In spite of the danger and discomfort that everyone experiences even going only partially up the mountain, they're all looking forward to the real thing. They know they'll be cold, exhausted and scared, while having trouble breathing and facing the unpredictability of the mountain, but they didn't come this far to quit. Their experiences turn out much worse than anything any of them could have imagined.\n\n"Everest" is a fascinating and gripping adventure. Like other movies about mountain climbing, this one fails to give a satisfactory reason for why these people risk their lives for little more than a great view and bragging rights, but it's clear that there are a variety of justifications within the group. The script depicts this climb as an extremely risky venture, but allows us to marvel at the courage, determination and, in some cases, self-sacrifice of these people. The character development (thanks to a great script and a terrific cast) is outstanding and the cinematography is as impressive as you'd expect (especially in IMAX 3-D). The suffering of the climbers (even when things are going according to plan), the thrilling moments (when circumstances throw the plan into chaos), the heartbreak and the small victories along the way all make us feel like we're right there on that mountain. The hardships and the tragedies of this expedition are sometimes shot and edited oddly, but are never exploitive. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur brings us an engaging, eye-opening and beautiful film that most are likely to appreciate.

Could you be a bit more specific? Assuming that you're not talking about making a trip to Nepal, there are still many ways to interpret your request besides seeing the 2015 docudrama. The world's tallest mountain is the center of the story in a 1998 documentary, a 2007 TV mini-series, a 2014-2015 TV series and another film project still in development. All of these treatments are simply titled, "Everest". More to the point, 2015's "Everest" (PG-13, 2:01) re-tells the specific story from the '98 doc and a 1997 TV movie ("Into Thin Air: Death on Everest"), but tells it more vividly than ever before.\n\nThe '97, '98 and 2015 films all take us along for doomed expeditions up the tallest peak in the Himalayas in May 1996, as told in at least five books by survivors, most famously in journalist Jon Krakauer's 1997 best-seller "Into Thin Air", which is the primary basis for the screenplay of 2015's "Everest". As the film tells us early on, by the late 1980s, climbing Everest had transitioned from the domain of adventurers like George Mallory and Edmund Hillary with minimal equipment to a tourist destination for thrill-seekers with little climbing experience, but enough money to buy state-of-the-art equipment, stay in established base camps, and hire local Sherpas as guides and, in some cases, to carry the climber's gear and cook meals. But as the films about the 1996 climbs (and subsequent major avalanches) have shown, no amount of money, gear, help or even experience can insulate anyone from the dangers inherent in this climb. "The last word," as one character in the 2015 film says, "always belongs to the mountain." "Everest" follows two of the expeditions which suffered tragic losses on the mountain on May 10-11, 1996. Rival expedition leaders Rob Hall (Jason Clarke), of the company Adventure Consultants, and Scott Fischer (Jake Gyllenhaal), of Mountain Madness, decide to work together due to the large number of people trying to reach the peak on May 10th. The main focus of the story is Hall's team, which includes people with a wide range of personal backgrounds. Hall is an experienced New Zealand mountaineer who has already climbed to the top of Everest four times, including once with his wife, Jan (Keira Knightley), who has stayed in New Zealand this time due to her pregnancy. Doug Hansen (John Hawkes) is a mailman who attempted Everest once before and wants to reach the summit as a way of inspiring schoolchildren back home in Washington state. Yasuko Namba is a 47-year-old Japanese woman who has already climbed the other six of the famed Seven Summits and wants to become the oldest woman to reach the top of Everest. Beck Weathers (Josh Brolin) is an adventurous Texan who is also pursuing the goal of the Seven Summits, but has lied to his wife, Peach (Robin Wright), about his current trip to Everest. Jon Krakauer is a writer for "Outside" magazine, but has never been on a climb above 8000m. Several of the people portrayed in this film died on Everest and others barely escaped with their lives.\n\n"Everest" is much more than a high-altitude adventure movie or disaster flick. Besides learning about the personal backgrounds of the characters, we follow them on their entire adventure, from beginning to end, learning a good bit about mountain climbing along the way. One of the first things we learn is that, to these people, summit is a verb. Hall lays out the dangers of summiting Everest in his briefing to his team before they even set foot on the mountain. "Human beings are not designed to function at the cruising altitude of a 747. Your bodies will be literally dying," he says. This group understands all that, but they've put their trust in the honest, personable and level-headed Hall. And they've paid him a lot of money ($65,000 each) to get them to the top of Everest – and safely back down. At base camp, Hall and his friend and colleague, Helen Wilton (Emily Watson), and their fellow Adventure Consultants employees, teach, coach and take care of their customers, including Hall taking them on some practice climbs. In spite of the danger and discomfort that everyone experiences even going only partially up the mountain, they're all looking forward to the real thing. They know they'll be cold, exhausted and scared, while having trouble breathing and facing the unpredictability of the mountain, but they didn't come this far to quit. Their experiences turn out much worse than anything any of them could have imagined.\n\n"Everest" is a fascinating and gripping adventure. Like other movies about mountain climbing, this one fails to give a satisfactory reason for why these people risk their lives for little more than a great view and bragging rights, but it's clear that there are a variety of justifications within the group. The script depicts this climb as an extremely risky venture, but allows us to marvel at the courage, determination and, in some cases, self-sacrifice of these people. The character development (thanks to a great script and a terrific cast) is outstanding and the cinematography is as impressive as you'd expect (especially in IMAX 3-D). The suffering of the climbers (even when things are going according to plan), the thrilling moments (when circumstances throw the plan into chaos), the heartbreak and the small victories along the way all make us feel like we're right there on that mountain. The hardships and the tragedies of this expedition are sometimes shot and edited oddly, but are never exploitive. Icelandic director Baltasar Kormákur brings us an engaging, eye-opening and beautiful film that most are likely to appreciate.

It has its moments of "belt-in- the-face" fun, but they are consistently grounded in the real problems the lead characters face -- unemployment, loss of family, lack of self-respect, fear of ridicule and a bleak future that promises even greater failure.  This is not a Farrelly Brothers kind of story...and that is what makes it so special.\n\nGaz is broke, on welfare, lives in the projects, is behind on his child support and is threatened with losing his son to his ex-wife unless he can pull together 700 pounds (about $1100).  But this is Sheffield, England -- once a boomtown but now a deadening city of shopping malls and garment mills, where the factories (and the guys that worked in them) are empty shells of themselves.  The women have jobs; the men have job fairs.  Into this comes a touring "Chippendale's" dance troupe (aimed at women only; after all, they have the spare money) and an idea is born.  Gaz and some mates will strip all the way, give the ladies "the full monty", as a way to earn some quick change.\n\nThe idea is preposterous.

It has its moments of "belt-in- the-face" fun, but they are consistently grounded in the real problems the lead characters face -- unemployment, loss of family, lack of self-respect, fear of ridicule and a bleak future that promises even greater failure.  This is not a Farrelly Brothers kind of story...and that is what makes it so special.\n\nGaz is broke, on welfare, lives in the projects, is behind on his child support and is threatened with losing his son to his ex-wife unless he can pull together 700 pounds (about $1100).  But this is Sheffield, England -- once a boomtown but now a deadening city of shopping malls and garment mills, where the factories (and the guys that worked in them) are empty shells of themselves.  The women have jobs; the men have job fairs.  Into this comes a touring "Chippendale's" dance troupe (aimed at women only; after all, they have the spare money) and an idea is born.  Gaz and some mates will strip all the way, give the ladies "the full monty", as a way to earn some quick change.\n\nThe idea is preposterous.  Only one of the six men in the new dance troupe is good-looking enough to pull it off (pun intended); the rest are either fat, skinny, old and/or ugly.  But the movie's gentle suggestion is that not only is beauty in the eye of the beholder, but so is self-respect...and in following through with their plans, they gain a LOT more than just 2000 pounds each.\n\nRobert Carlyle is good as the anchor of the piece, always pushing and planning and cajoling and begging and even stealing, as need be, but it's the rest of the cast that makes this movie work -- from Tom Wilkinson as a manager ashamed to tell his wife he's lost his job to Mark Addy as a man who's so ashamed of how fat and unattractive he is, he's driving his wife away right down to Hugo Speer and his joyful "let's have a blast" attitude.\n\n"The Full Monty" is a gem of human comedy aimed not at the gut but at the sense of hope we all carry.

Yet it's convincingly played by its two terrific leads, while the barbed arguments carry enough sting that its soft-centred conclusion, contrived as it is, feels well earned.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":415,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-11","keywords":"mother","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3265118489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhmOTFiNzktNzJmNi00NmI3LWJmZTgtZjFhZjkzOGI5ZTU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzhmOTFiNzktNzJmNi00NmI3LWJmZTgtZjFhZjkzOGI5ZTU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0302345/","name":"Bronagh Gallagher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9252018/","name":"Lola Petticrew","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1073366/","name":"Mary Moulds"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2110096/","name":"Shelly Love"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0719712/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0724659/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10235159/","name":"Tess McGowan"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It also incorporates some cartooning along with interesting ideas - the Japanese dialogue is not always translated and when it is, it's by interpreters or foreign exchange students. Anderson manages to merge his style with the Japanese and it works seamlessly.\n\nIt's a very quirky film with an all too relatable story. I enjoyed the visuals more than the plot, I'll admit, but it was still a good movie, with the usual quick dialogues, jokes, strange characters - Tilda Swinton being the weirdest, no surprise there - and altogether it's a great experience.\n\nWithout spoilers, if you like Wes Anderson, you will like this movie. If you don't, buckle up, because this is jam-packed with everything that is his style, the quirky music works now fused with Japanese, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and the usual cast having very well fitting characters (watch out for the credits Anjelica Huston is there as a Mute Poodle) and the cinematography being interesting and stunning.\n\nP.S.

I enjoyed the visuals more than the plot, I'll admit, but it was still a good movie, with the usual quick dialogues, jokes, strange characters - Tilda Swinton being the weirdest, no surprise there - and altogether it's a great experience.\n\nWithout spoilers, if you like Wes Anderson, you will like this movie. If you don't, buckle up, because this is jam-packed with everything that is his style, the quirky music works now fused with Japanese, Bill Murray, Jeff Goldblum and the usual cast having very well fitting characters (watch out for the credits Anjelica Huston is there as a Mute Poodle) and the cinematography being interesting and stunning.\n\nP.S. It's still not a children's movie, don't let the format fool you.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":154757,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2018-03-30","keywords":"robot,dog,japan,stop motion animation,scientist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2651502617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZkYzYwNmQtNjk3ZC00Y2M2LThhY2EtODIzOThiNDJmMTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjZkYzYwNmQtNjk3ZC00Y2M2LThhY2EtODIzOThiNDJmMTk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Isle of Dogs' tells the story of Atari Kobayashi, 12-year-old ward to corrupt Mayor Kobayashi.

Just a sad story about a seemingly good kid that gets out of foster care and makes some very bad choices. 5 stars","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":856,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-22","keywords":"love,foster care,orphan,abandonment issues,emancipation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Friday's Child","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2967650073","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMyZGEyYzYtN2IxYi00YTgwLTlmN2EtYzhlNmExMGQ5MmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYWMyZGEyYzYtN2IxYi00YTgwLTlmN2EtYzhlNmExMGQ5MmE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4446467/","name":"Tye Sheridan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1782299/","name":"Imogen Poots","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2655177/","name":"Caleb Landry Jones"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2270935/","name":"A.J.

Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.\n\nVisually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2191662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.\n\nVisually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2191662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Its the one of the best series i have ever watched.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":27910,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-01-03","keywords":"police officer,emergency,emergency responder,firefighter,first responder","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000291/","name":"Angela Bassett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470244/","name":"Peter Krause","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4091533/","name":"Oliver Stark"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276440/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0680695/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1004299/","name":"Brad Falchuk","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0591101/","name":"Tim Minear","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614682/","name":"Ryan Murphy"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Episodes Mondays on Fox","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi357546521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDQwZTQ4MGUtYTMyNi00M2M5LWFmODUtMGUxYjc5MDM2Y2MxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDQwZTQ4MGUtYTMyNi00M2M5LWFmODUtMGUxYjc5MDM2Y2MxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":""&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The rest of the cast is good, working with the material they're given to perform.\n\n If you are trying to get away from the horrible news being bombarded at us these days, this is the film for you.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36077,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-06-04","keywords":"william shakespeare character,lawyer,divorce,villain arrested,spanking","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bringing Down the House","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi985399577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM3NGZjNzMtYWMzNS00MTkwLWJiMjEtMjhhNGEzODhjOTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmM3NGZjNzMtYWMzNS00MTkwLWJiMjEtMjhhNGEzODhjOTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Touchstone Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000188/","name":"Steve Martin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506405/","name":"Eugene Levy"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0788202/","name":"Adam Shankman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0278170/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064942/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276821/","name":"Jason Filardi"],"duration":"PT1H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

[+59%]","reviewBody":"The familiar rom-com beats are too hard to ignore in The Broken Hearts Gallery, but what holds it all together is a spunky little (lead) performance from Geraldine Viswanathan (who plays Lucy, an art gallery assistant). With a plot that's tailor-made for a romantic comedy (it has got a lot to do with Lucy's heartbreaks and the souvenirs she keeps from those broken relationships), The Broken Hearts Gallery makes the city of New York look like a standout character. Darc Montgomery plays Nick, the owner of a work-in-progress hotel, who bumps into Lucy in a rather unusual meet-cute. Their second (chance) encounter felt contrived as hell though.\n\nWhen the duo decides to convert part of the hotel space into a gallery for exhibiting souvenirs from relationships that fell through, the film picks up speed, charm, and some romantic vibes.

[+59%]","reviewBody":"The familiar rom-com beats are too hard to ignore in The Broken Hearts Gallery, but what holds it all together is a spunky little (lead) performance from Geraldine Viswanathan (who plays Lucy, an art gallery assistant). With a plot that's tailor-made for a romantic comedy (it has got a lot to do with Lucy's heartbreaks and the souvenirs she keeps from those broken relationships), The Broken Hearts Gallery makes the city of New York look like a standout character. Darc Montgomery plays Nick, the owner of a work-in-progress hotel, who bumps into Lucy in a rather unusual meet-cute. Their second (chance) encounter felt contrived as hell though.\n\nWhen the duo decides to convert part of the hotel space into a gallery for exhibiting souvenirs from relationships that fell through, the film picks up speed, charm, and some romantic vibes. I didn't expect many surprises in the screenplay (which occasionally descends into downright cheesiness) but what bothered me was the distinct lack of humor. Here and there, we get a chuckle or two, courtesy of the largely silent Jeff (Nathan Dales), Eva Woolf (a spirited Bernadette Peters), and Marcos (Arturo Castro).

The final criticism I have is that Edna definitely deserved more screen time.\n\nThat being said, it is still an entertaining movie and not at all "painful" to watch.\n\nIn conclusion, 'Incredibles 2' is funny, exciting, and really worth a viewing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":271870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2018-06-13","keywords":"computer animation,superheroine,superhero,working mother,parenting","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3210917913","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmRmNGU5YjMtZTdmMi00NDAwLTg0MTktMmE3YmNhY2MyY2E5XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmRmNGU5YjMtZTdmMi00NDAwLTg0MTktMmE3YmNhY2MyY2E5XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Helen (voice of Holly Hunter) is called on to lead a campaign to bring Supers back, while Bob (voice of Craig T.

Family movie about a teenage boy whose parents fight so much he's had enough. At school, he and his adoptable friend are talented love matchmakers. These two are presented with challenges, see opportunity and act upon it. .. Much to the benefit of their friends. But when the boy stages the plan to separate his parents, wanting to make his own life better, she is conflicted. And that's the core of the movie. What I was absolutely not expecting, yet amazingly surprised and gripped by, was the depth of feelings and connections expressed between each and all of these characters. The writing was fluid. Conversations were easy, natural, and enjoyable even when their content was difficult. Each scene had a purpose and I was always curious what would happen next?

Family movie about a teenage boy whose parents fight so much he's had enough. At school, he and his adoptable friend are talented love matchmakers. These two are presented with challenges, see opportunity and act upon it. .. Much to the benefit of their friends. But when the boy stages the plan to separate his parents, wanting to make his own life better, she is conflicted. And that's the core of the movie. What I was absolutely not expecting, yet amazingly surprised and gripped by, was the depth of feelings and connections expressed between each and all of these characters. The writing was fluid. Conversations were easy, natural, and enjoyable even when their content was difficult. Each scene had a purpose and I was always curious what would happen next? Watching our scope of freedom building, I was afraid of where I thought this might lead. I feel these choices could've been inspired by somebody's real life choices.

This is a bizarre film, unnecessarily complicated, that assembles a top-notch cast, puts them into a tense situation with all the players in place, and then has nothing to do with them. It's like the writer forgot that you needed a third act; it's all rising action with no denouement.\n\nWashington plays Det. Frazier, a hostage negotiator who acts, literally, as if this is his first case. He has the obligatory younger partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor, "Serenity") who exists so Frazier can explain his theories and the obligatory ESU commander who wants to go in and shoot everyone (Willem Dafoe, sadly underused). Owen plays the bank robber, about whom frustratingly nothing is known except what he said into the camera in the trailer. Finally, Foster plays some sort of player amongst the Powers That Be who walks into the mayor's office, demands an update, and is given "every possible courtesy", etc. She serves no purpose whatsoever, not even in a clichéd action movie type of way like Dafoe and Ejiofor. The performances are the only good part of the movie, but there are times when you can tell that the actors wished they were in a better film. They're giving it their all, and they're getting no help from anyone else involved.\n\nSpike Lee is up to his usual tricks here, which, in this type of movie, is a very bad thing. The details of the heist itself I won't disclose. I can't. The action is, at best, vague - extremely brief scenes of vaults opening, hole-digging, hostage roughing up, and the usual bank-robber stuff are all the details we really get. It is also inter cut with scenes of the hostages recalling the heist; their recollections serve no purpose except to confuse the audience further. "Inside Man" is curiously racist: the white crooks rough up the black bank customers, the white Foster and the mayor order around Washington, the white cops mistake a Sikh for an Arab and beat him, and even a Jewish hostage was not only a lawyer, but has a nephew who is a jeweler. Washington and Ejiofor are given no flaws whatsoever and are seen mostly being pushed around by everyone else in the movie. The action repeatedly grinds to a halt so Lee can insert quirky little subplots involving video games, Washington's much younger girlfriend and random Albanian women. They're at best unnecessary, at worst, disastrous. If we had been given a director with more focus, there is the feeling that this could have been a lean, mean thriller. But it drags and drags and drags and when we get to the end, we understand why the film stalled for so long: the ending is about as climatic as erectile dysfunction.\n\n"Inside Man" looked like it had it all - great cast, good concept, reputable director, but the end result is a near-disaster. It's like someone threw "Dog Day Afternoon" into a blender, drank it, and vomited it back onto the screen. As I stumbled out of the theater, deprived of my money and time, I cursed the screen gods who thought to tease me with such an improbably bad movie. I thought back to a better day, when a movie at least knew what was going on even if the audience didn't, gave us characters who seemed like actual people and served actual purposes to the plot, so that even if we had to wait until the Big Twist to answer our questions, we at least had a reason to still care."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It always had the ingredients for a fascinating study of human behaviour. Its conductor Dr. Philip Zimbardo knew that, it just had to be played out. Of course, The Stanford Prison Experiment is a story that's been notably portrayed before, such as the 2001 German film Das Experiment. I remember being a fan of it when I first saw it, but I admit I can't quite recall it enough to make a comparison here. Nevertheless, this American version which doesn't make substitutions is a preferable version, one that makes resourceful use of today's technology and young talent. There's a dual study going on here. One, the part that writes itself, a document of the actual experiment. And the other, an examination of the ethics of the experimenters. Here is the ugly side of the human condition and our desires to push one another to feel the sweet taste of superiority.\n\nWhile it may lend the obvious yet compelling results of what imaginary power and authority does to people, it still needs to be well executed to work. Fortunately director Kyle Patrick Alvarez and writer Tim Talbott have the right handling of the material, working with great economy in balancing its dichotomy's. At first it's disarmingly casual in the way the volunteers are selected and summoned, making a point of its randomizations and often offering an endearing and natural sense of humour. While superficially bleak, it's having fun with the 70s clothes and oversized moustaches, without peeling back their integrity. But then real tension, real anguish, and a real sensation of danger and dread creeps in and The Stanford Prison Experiment becomes deeply unsettling in its dehumanization techniques. With a careful sense from Alvarez of how far to escalate each sequence, it rings true to human sensibilities of what would happen in this unique situation. There's always a reminder that it isn't real, but it doesn't stop you from feeling unbearably trapped. This is nature at work, combined with a touch of modern cruelty.\n\nThere is a tendency in the film's inherent and forgivably episodic narrative that it gets you attached to a character they're focusing on only due to their upcoming exit. Thereby the film loses steam bit by bit. It gradually wins you back afterwards, but each time it takes a little longer. Ezra Miller in particular is a highlight of the first half of the film, formulating some of the most memorable instances of the prisoner's rebellions and reluctances. He's missed, but his absence only breeds more tension and vulnerability as we're left with weaker willed volunteers. If anything, this film is an impressive display of the best talent from the next generation of actors. Hopefully all to soon be familiar faces; Johnny Simmons, Tye Sheridan, Brett Davern, and a guard with the most inventive choice of wording, Michael Angarano, all stick out among other strong performances. While a crowded ensemble does mean no character gets to be fleshed out to their full potential, Alvarez and Talbott at least give room for everyone a time to shine without any dim spots.\n\nOn the experimenters end, Billy Crudup is perfect casting as Dr. Zimbardo. Donning a beard that gives him an uncanny resemblance to Satan, it doesn't remove that trustworthy glint of compassion in his eyes. His usual warmth is countered by his malicious intent to shove the volunteers to their limits and it creates an enthralling inner conflict where he's finding his own limits. The film admittedly does lack a female presence giving the nature of 24 volunteers and all the scientists being men. Its only example is Olivia Thirlby as Zimbardo's girlfriend who later involves herself in the experiment and becomes a voice of reason, but a very welcome one. It may have blind spots and a few stumbles, but it doesn't hinder what the film does right. As I was completely wrapped in its deft and dense confrontations, I kept waiting for the film to explode. Perhaps recalling the more gritty approach Das Experiment took to its second half, instead this implodes, which is a much more restrained and satisfying conclusion to watch these invisible social constructs dissolve rather than erupt.\n\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment's wealth of strong material and performances are matched by its technical ambitions. The slick photography makes it cinematic with liberal collages of close-ups and swift camera moves but still keeping it intimate. When the scene calls for rigid obedience, any time the camera moves out of line we hold our breath. It's graded with a washed-out atmosphere, relishing in the moody darkness. I've been irritated with indie films that abuse a shallow depth of field in their photography for no good reason, but this film uses it to isolate you in its grasp and as a result the film shook me up for the rest of the day. While it gets under the skin of the prisoners and the scientists, I did find myself wanting to get behind the motivations of the guards, the most vocal contributors of the experiment. Instead, thats saved for an epilogue that feels like a wise afterthought, but it's a powerful note on the personal experiments we run just because the opportunity is there. The Stanford Prison Experiment is an ideal taut psychological thriller that bristles with youthful energy and will mostly likely remain standing as one of the best of the year.\n\n8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41130,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-07-17","keywords":"prisoner,guard,prison,psychology,university","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi739618841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU4MDQwNDc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMzg5NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU4MDQwNDc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMzg5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It is the summer of 1971.

It always had the ingredients for a fascinating study of human behaviour. Its conductor Dr. Philip Zimbardo knew that, it just had to be played out. Of course, The Stanford Prison Experiment is a story that's been notably portrayed before, such as the 2001 German film Das Experiment. I remember being a fan of it when I first saw it, but I admit I can't quite recall it enough to make a comparison here. Nevertheless, this American version which doesn't make substitutions is a preferable version, one that makes resourceful use of today's technology and young talent. There's a dual study going on here. One, the part that writes itself, a document of the actual experiment. And the other, an examination of the ethics of the experimenters. Here is the ugly side of the human condition and our desires to push one another to feel the sweet taste of superiority.\n\nWhile it may lend the obvious yet compelling results of what imaginary power and authority does to people, it still needs to be well executed to work. Fortunately director Kyle Patrick Alvarez and writer Tim Talbott have the right handling of the material, working with great economy in balancing its dichotomy's. At first it's disarmingly casual in the way the volunteers are selected and summoned, making a point of its randomizations and often offering an endearing and natural sense of humour. While superficially bleak, it's having fun with the 70s clothes and oversized moustaches, without peeling back their integrity. But then real tension, real anguish, and a real sensation of danger and dread creeps in and The Stanford Prison Experiment becomes deeply unsettling in its dehumanization techniques. With a careful sense from Alvarez of how far to escalate each sequence, it rings true to human sensibilities of what would happen in this unique situation. There's always a reminder that it isn't real, but it doesn't stop you from feeling unbearably trapped. This is nature at work, combined with a touch of modern cruelty.\n\nThere is a tendency in the film's inherent and forgivably episodic narrative that it gets you attached to a character they're focusing on only due to their upcoming exit. Thereby the film loses steam bit by bit. It gradually wins you back afterwards, but each time it takes a little longer. Ezra Miller in particular is a highlight of the first half of the film, formulating some of the most memorable instances of the prisoner's rebellions and reluctances. He's missed, but his absence only breeds more tension and vulnerability as we're left with weaker willed volunteers. If anything, this film is an impressive display of the best talent from the next generation of actors. Hopefully all to soon be familiar faces; Johnny Simmons, Tye Sheridan, Brett Davern, and a guard with the most inventive choice of wording, Michael Angarano, all stick out among other strong performances. While a crowded ensemble does mean no character gets to be fleshed out to their full potential, Alvarez and Talbott at least give room for everyone a time to shine without any dim spots.\n\nOn the experimenters end, Billy Crudup is perfect casting as Dr. Zimbardo.

Rosario Dawson plays the yardmaster that assists from headquarters while Jessy Schram plays the separated wife of the newbie conductor.\n\nThe movie's based on the real-life CSX 8888 Incident, otherwise known as the Crazy Eights Incident, which involved a runaway freight train in northwestern Ohio in 2001. Locomotive #8888 was pulling 47 cars, including some with hazardous chemicals, and ran unmanned for two hours and 66 miles at speeds of up to 51 mph. (***Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know how the real-life incident ended before seeing the movie***). Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed, as did an attempt by police to shoot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which didn't work because the button has to be pressed for several seconds before the engine shuts down due to lack of fuel. A northbound freight train took succor in a siding area where the crew released its locomotive and waited for the runaway to pass. Like in the movie, they had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, a relative neophyte conductor. They proceeded to chase the runaway train and successfully locked on to the rear car of the runaway, then slowing it by applying the dynamic brakes or their locomotive. Once the runaway had slowed to 11 miles per hour, trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, jumped on, and shut down the engine.\n\nWhile the movie starts somewhat bland it quickly picks up momentum for a realistic non-stop thrill ride. The realism is refreshing in this day and age of cartoony action blockbusters and their multiple "yeah, right" action scenes (not that there's anything wrong with those movies, as long as you're in the right mode). Washington and Pine make for good protagonists and you start to care about them as the story progresses. Moreover, the movie doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 98 minutes.\n\nThe film was shot in numerous locations extending from central Pennsylvania to eastern Ohio, which serve up a nice rolling hills backdrop with the occasional river. Minor note: You'll observe a woodchuck scamper across the tracks in one scene where he/she thankfully DOESN'T become ground chuck.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: "Unstoppable" is worthwhile as a believable disaster thriller. While it lacks the potent subtext and overall greatness of 1985's "Runaway Train," it makes up for it with its realistic and kinetic tone, not to mention the fact that it's based on a true incident.\n\nGRADE: B","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-11-10","keywords":"train,runaway train,train engineer,freight train,train movie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unstoppable: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3068790297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A rail company frantically works to prevent an unmanned, half-mile-long freight train carrying combustible liquids and poisonous gas from wiping out a city."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276484/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093560/","name":"Mark Bomback"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Overall the movie was GREAT! It was really funny, often in unexpected places, the storyline kept you engaged the entire time and the overall mood was lighthearted and inspiring. A real "feel-good" movie. I admit I was a bit skeptical going in, I mean the idea of a rat in a kitchen kind of left me queasy, but I left the theater excited to see it again when it is released.

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to.

I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know.

In every single scene I kept getting surprised and thrilled at just how amazing the CGI and 3D were.

Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly haunting in every scene he's in. That was one well made and scary villain that Mowgli had to face. Jon Favreau did a fantastic work with this movie, cause really this story has been told many times before, and yet this movie feels fresh and interesting nonetheless.

Neel Sethi plays the main character, Mowgli in the movie. He is the only human being on screen and as his first ever role, this kid actor is truly magnificent. He is as good as any kid actor has ever been, even favorably compared to Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. The computer generated imagery is brilliant all throughout, definitely some of the best ever and the 3D is just mind blowing. In every single scene I kept getting surprised and thrilled at just how amazing the CGI and 3D were. I think the main reason as to why this movie worked it's because it also has a very good story line that's mixed in with the amazing visuals. Also, the voice actors are all perfectly cast. Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly haunting in every scene he's in. That was one well made and scary villain that Mowgli had to face.

Neel Sethi plays the main character, Mowgli in the movie. He is the only human being on screen and as his first ever role, this kid actor is truly magnificent. He is as good as any kid actor has ever been, even favorably compared to Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. The computer generated imagery is brilliant all throughout, definitely some of the best ever and the 3D is just mind blowing. In every single scene I kept getting surprised and thrilled at just how amazing the CGI and 3D were. I think the main reason as to why this movie worked it's because it also has a very good story line that's mixed in with the amazing visuals. Also, the voice actors are all perfectly cast. Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly haunting in every scene he's in. That was one well made and scary villain that Mowgli had to face. Jon Favreau did a fantastic work with this movie, cause really this story has been told many times before, and yet this movie feels fresh and interesting nonetheless.

As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle ","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0455824/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Imdbidia"},"dateCreated":"2011-02-22","inLanguage":"English","name":"Old-style epic romantic movie","reviewBody":"An entertaining romantic drama by Buz Luhrmann, old-Hollywood style.\n\nThe movie is set in the Northern Territory of Australia in the years previous to the involvement of Japan in the WW II, and tells the story of Sarah Ashley -an English lady who goes to Australia to try to get her husband back to England and ends becoming the head of their Australian cattle farm-, Drover -an independent free-spirited cattle and horse drover that works for her- and Nullah -a half-caste Aboriginal child who lives in the farm and struggles to live in a world in which he's alien to both blacks and whites.\n\nThis is one of those movies that you can say it is done as the movies of the golden era of Hollywood used to be - flashy wonderfully well-looking movie stars, great scenery and great studio settings, detailed recreation of the era's fashion, decoration, atmosphere, etc., , and a simple epic plot with a great love story. Australia has all of this, but also a little bit of corn, a thin plot, weak characters and flaws that are even more noticeable in a super-production like this.\n\nThe script is uneven and Manichean (with angels and demons) and mixes several movie genres (romantic comedy, romantic drama, war movie, western movie, and Aboriginal movie) with different degrees of success. The characters are descriptive and without emotional depth, and that affects the acting. However, I loved the depiction of the magic and wisdom of Aboriginal Australians, which is really well presented, with its magic beliefs and philosophical and environmental approach to the world. I think that part is truly genuine and real and reaches the viewer. I also loved that Lady Ashley's character is the one of a true modern woman, as she is a strong-willed free woman, a boss, the boss of her man, a woman who always leads, never submissive or afraid of being alone if she doesn't get what she wants. That's a post-modern woman, so rare to see in cinema nowadays.\n\nThe acting is unconvincing on the part of the leading actors. Hugh Jackman's performance is just OK in his role, while Nicole Kidman disappoints in the comic part of the movie, as she seems not to relax when she does so, but she warms up to her usual self when the story becomes more dramatic; she looks beautiful in this movie, like a 50s movie star, although those inflated siliconed lips were a distraction... Jackman and Kidman make a great couple, but their chemistry on camera was nothing memorable and you see yourself seeing two actors playing a couple, not a real couple on screen.\n\nMost supporting actors are good in their roles, especially the Aboriginal ones, who really shine in this film. David Gulpilil is simply terrific, completely believable and inspired in his role of the Aboriginal Elder King George. Brandon Walters, despite his youth, offers a memorable performance, and his face really lights up the screen. Also great is the actor who plays Drove's Aboriginal pal, who also offers a solid performance. They are the ones who really give soul to the movie.\n\nDespite what you might expect, the cinematography is poor. I was expecting the rare beauty of the Northern Territory to be captured by the always stylish and colorful Luhrmann. However, the part of the movie that happens during the dry season is completely opaque and colorless, ugly to watch, while the scenes happening during the rainy season are again limited in colors.To my disenchantment, many of the most colorful and beautiful scenes are digitally created or enhanced, while others seem to have been shot in big studios. Just the Mission island seems to convey that luxurious real feeling of the NT vegetation. Some of the most beautiful bits of the real land, the aerial vistas, look like if they had been taken for a documentary for National Geographic. Where is the emotional connection of the story with the land? In other words, the viewer doesn't go beyond what the eyes see. So, one wonders, why the movie was called Australia and why it was sold as a movie that captured the spirit of this country. To be honest, I thought that most scenes in the movie could have been shot anywhere in the world not in Australia.\n\nThe movie is a little too long. Most of the first half an hour could have been removed , condensed or presented in another way to give the non-Aboriginal characters more emotional background and depth. For example, we barely know why Neil Fletcher wants so badly Sarah's farm, and why he's so wicked in general but he loves a lovable sweet good- hearted woman. He is just an archetypal bad-guy, period.\n\nDespite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie, especially the second hour and a half, and that heaven of a man that is Hugh Jackman. God Bless him and his holy body.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":122133,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Australia: Directed by Baz Luhrmann. With Shea Adams, Eddie Baroo, Ray Barrett, Tony Barry. Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot. As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle over unforgiving landscape, they experience the bombing of Darwin, Australia, by Japanese forces firsthand." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0455824/","name":"Australia","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjJhMTAyZWMtMjRlZC00NWU3LTg3ODQtYTkyZjRiN2NhY2Y5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTIzOTk5ODM@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot. As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle ","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0455824/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Imdbidia","dateCreated":"2011-02-22","inLanguage":"English","name":"Old-style epic romantic movie","reviewBody":"An entertaining romantic drama by Buz Luhrmann, old-Hollywood style.\n\nThe movie is set in the Northern Territory of Australia in the years previous to the involvement of Japan in the WW II, and tells the story of Sarah Ashley -an English lady who goes to Australia to try to get her husband back to England and ends becoming the head of their Australian cattle farm-, Drover -an independent free-spirited cattle and horse drover that works for her- and Nullah -a half-caste Aboriginal child who lives in the farm and struggles to live in a world in which he's alien to both blacks and whites.\n\nThis is one of those movies that you can say it is done as the movies of the golden era of Hollywood used to be - flashy wonderfully well-looking movie stars, great scenery and great studio settings, detailed recreation of the era's fashion, decoration, atmosphere, etc., , and a simple epic plot with a great love story. Australia has all of this, but also a little bit of corn, a thin plot, weak characters and flaws that are even more noticeable in a super-production like this.\n\nThe script is uneven and Manichean (with angels and demons) and mixes several movie genres (romantic comedy, romantic drama, war movie, western movie, and Aboriginal movie) with different degrees of success. The characters are descriptive and without emotional depth, and that affects the acting. However, I loved the depiction of the magic and wisdom of Aboriginal Australians, which is really well presented, with its magic beliefs and philosophical and environmental approach to the world. I think that part is truly genuine and real and reaches the viewer. I also loved that Lady Ashley's character is the one of a true modern woman, as she is a strong-willed free woman, a boss, the boss of her man, a woman who always leads, never submissive or afraid of being alone if she doesn't get what she wants. That's a post-modern woman, so rare to see in cinema nowadays.\n\nThe acting is unconvincing on the part of the leading actors. Hugh Jackman's performance is just OK in his role, while Nicole Kidman disappoints in the comic part of the movie, as she seems not to relax when she does so, but she warms up to her usual self when the story becomes more dramatic; she looks beautiful in this movie, like a 50s movie star, although those inflated siliconed lips were a distraction... Jackman and Kidman make a great couple, but their chemistry on camera was nothing memorable and you see yourself seeing two actors playing a couple, not a real couple on screen.\n\nMost supporting actors are good in their roles, especially the Aboriginal ones, who really shine in this film. David Gulpilil is simply terrific, completely believable and inspired in his role of the Aboriginal Elder King George. Brandon Walters, despite his youth, offers a memorable performance, and his face really lights up the screen. Also great is the actor who plays Drove's Aboriginal pal, who also offers a solid performance. They are the ones who really give soul to the movie.\n\nDespite what you might expect, the cinematography is poor. I was expecting the rare beauty of the Northern Territory to be captured by the always stylish and colorful Luhrmann. However, the part of the movie that happens during the dry season is completely opaque and colorless, ugly to watch, while the scenes happening during the rainy season are again limited in colors.To my disenchantment, many of the most colorful and beautiful scenes are digitally created or enhanced, while others seem to have been shot in big studios. Just the Mission island seems to convey that luxurious real feeling of the NT vegetation. Some of the most beautiful bits of the real land, the aerial vistas, look like if they had been taken for a documentary for National Geographic. Where is the emotional connection of the story with the land? In other words, the viewer doesn't go beyond what the eyes see. So, one wonders, why the movie was called Australia and why it was sold as a movie that captured the spirit of this country. To be honest, I thought that most scenes in the movie could have been shot anywhere in the world not in Australia.\n\nThe movie is a little too long. Most of the first half an hour could have been removed , condensed or presented in another way to give the non-Aboriginal characters more emotional background and depth. For example, we barely know why Neil Fletcher wants so badly Sarah's farm, and why he's so wicked in general but he loves a lovable sweet good- hearted woman. He is just an archetypal bad-guy, period.\n\nDespite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie, especially the second hour and a half, and that heaven of a man that is Hugh Jackman. God Bless him and his holy body.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":122133,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"],"duration":"PT2H45M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-04-11","keywords":"violence,prison,jakarta indonesia,kitchen fight,corrupt police officer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi530950937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDk5Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDk5Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Immediately following the events of the original, Officer Rama is pressured to join an anti-corruption task force to guarantee protection for his wife and child.

With its fast paced action and believable fight scene choreography whilst not being over the top with an aim for realism that would diminish the combat's entertainment factor.\n\nWith 'The Raid 2: Berandal', we are brought back into the gritty world of the first movie directly following where the story left off. The viewers are introduced to an entirely new perspective on the world where the first movie is set. In the first movie we are locked in the one perspective of Rama and his battle through the building, whilst in the sequel we learn that this all takes place as part of a much larger setting. We find out that realism is not the aim of the series and instead its a world of gangsters, villains and corruption.\n\nEvans is able to introduce new characters like the 'Hammer Girl' and the 'Baseball Bat' guy without making them seem totally over the top and ridiculous. We also get to watch them fight and are able to enjoy their unique styles rather than the usual, 'this character is a bad guy' scenes to barely introduce them.\n\nThe fight scenes are excellently choreographed and the way they are shot is spectacular, a lot of imagination and ingenuity is used to really throw the viewer directly into the action. The gore and violence level reflect far more realistic outcomes considering the brutality of both the scenarios and the weapons.\n\nWhen I try to compare this to the usual Hollywood blockbuster action movies reduced to PG13 to get more people in to watch it, its impossible. The movie delivers far more in the way of action and fight sequences whilst maintaining a sensible and cohesive plot.\n\nIf you are expecting(for some bizarre reason) to see an amazing plot to compare to The Godfather or The Departed you probably are expecting the wrong things. If you are expecting to see a amazing fighting / martial arts movie with a believable plot you wont be disappointed. The movie reminded me a little of a Tarantino film with its characters, something like Kill Bill. But instead with way way way better fight scenes and frankly, a better plot as well.\n\nOverall considering where this movie is from and the cast involved etc any negative rating is totally undeserved. Whilst not everyone's cup of tea as far as martial arts / action movies go this movie will be impossible to top in 2014, and frankly its probably the best action movie I have seen in the last decade, it will be on the top of my list for a while.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":119293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2014-04-11","keywords":"violence,prison,jakarta indonesia,kitchen fight,corrupt police officer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi530950937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDk5Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyMDk5Mzg1MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQ4NjMyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Immediately following the events of the original, Officer Rama is pressured to join an anti-corruption task force to guarantee protection for his wife and child.

"Percy Vs Goliath") is a biographical drama film based on the life of Canadian farmer Percy Schmeiser. Directed by Clark Johnson ("S. W. A. T.", "The Sentinel") and starring Christopher Walken, Christina Ricci, and Zach Braff, it is a relatively routine true story picture that benefits primarily from its main star holding things together.\n\nIn 1998, in the Canadian town of Bruno, Saskatchewan, elderly farmer Percy Schmeiser (Christopher Walken) one day discovers he is being sued by the Monsanto corporation for allegedly using their enhanced GMO seeds for several years. Due to his family's limited funds, Percy cannot afford to take them on by himself and so enlists the help of young hotshot lawyer Jackson Weaver (Zach Braff) and environmental activist Rebecca Salcau (Christina Ricci) to fight a legal battle to ensure the safety of crops belonging to farmers everywhere. Because of the constant media exposure, Percy and his team gain many supporters from all over the world who motivate them to keep going in their pursuit of justice over the domineering corporate businesses.\n\nSince moving to a more rural neighbourhood many years ago, I have come to appreciate how hard farmers work to provide consumers with the best quality product they are capable of growing. Naturally, there will be various things that prove problematic along the way, such as the pressure to use GMOs or unsafe pesticides in their fruits and vegetables. In the film "Percy", we see that these factors are more serious than we may have originally thought, causing us to question the legality of corporate interference in selling harvested crops to unknowing customers. Although the film initially presents this as a locally Canadian issue, it is later established that there are corporations in other countries guilty of doing this as well. One scene in particular shows that farmers in India are suffering at the hands of big businesses bullying them into submission, which has contributed to high suicide rates among workers in that profession. It made me wonder how badly farmers have it in my own area as more than twenty years later, the issue of GMOs and pesticides are still a prevalent issue today.\n\nThere's little to say in terms of the directorial style here. Clark Johnson keeps things going at a simplistic level, intercutting between moments of Percy and co discussing legal matters with generic shots of the Saskatchewan farmland. Granted, it would be rather difficult to make subject matter like GMO seeds interesting to most audiences but for the most part he succeeds, showing that the future of a farmer's livelihood is at stake here. While I am aware this film is based on true events, I still wish it was less pedestrian in its approach to the source material. Everything felt as though it was following a typical template set by much better biographical dramas before it. As a result, I often found myself drifting in and out of my investment in the story, as I could tell right away how things were going to end due to the predictable direction that it was heading. Despite that, I was at least still curious to see how other farmers would react to the final court ruling of what Percy and his group ended up with.\n\nIt's easy to take for granted an actor like Christopher Walken, due to how prolific he is and the large amount of bizarre performances he's given in the past. Here, however, Walken demonstrates a dramatic range we often forget he's capable of, bringing a relatable sincerity to the role of Percy Schmeiser, a humble Canadian farmer who only wants what's best for the produce he grows (in this case, canola), bringing a necessary emotional centre to the film. I'm not sure how accurate his accent was, as American and Canadian accents sound almost identical to me, but I did feel he did a decent enough job convincing me that he was from North of the border. It was also nice to see Christina Ricci in a supporting role, as I consider her to be highly underrated. Ricci is one of those actresses whom I've never seen give a bad performance in anything she's in, and this film is no exception. I liked how her character remained a loyal ally to Percy, even accompanying him on international ventures to promote his cause. Zach Braff, on the other hand, wasn't featured as often as he should have been. This is a shame as I enjoyed seeing his character standing up for Percy and farmers everywhere based on his own moral principles rather than for monetary reasons. He is only prominently seen during the first and final acts of the film, which leads me to believe he was likely written in as a mere afterthought.\n\nWhile the film is nothing groundbreaking, it's still a decent enough drama to hold one's attention for its short duration of 99 minutes. It proudly wears its anti-capitalist morals on its sleeve so anyone who likes movies that try to "stick it to the man" should derive enough entertainment from something like this. As for me, I liked the acting the most, mainly from Walken and Ricci, so I hope those two will work together on something else in the future.\n\nI rate it 6.5/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1537,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-04-30","keywords":"farmer,organic farmer,cross contamination,lawsuit,courtroom","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Percy Vs Goliath Official US Trailer (2021)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi260423705","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlZTEwZGUtNmZjYi00MjkwLThjYTMtNWU4NDg0MDk2MDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlZTEwZGUtNmZjYi00MjkwLThjYTMtNWU4NDg0MDk2MDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000686/","name":"Christopher Walken"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0561809/","name":"Roberta Maxwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000207/","name":"Christina Ricci"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424800/","name":"Clark Johnson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293963/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0705676/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0141447/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2125366/","name":"Garfield Lindsay Miller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0429499/","name":"Hilary Pryor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1285700/","name":"Maureen Dorey"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Despite that, I was at least still curious to see how other farmers would react to the final court ruling of what Percy and his group ended up with.\n\nIt's easy to take for granted an actor like Christopher Walken, due to how prolific he is and the large amount of bizarre performances he's given in the past. Here, however, Walken demonstrates a dramatic range we often forget he's capable of, bringing a relatable sincerity to the role of Percy Schmeiser, a humble Canadian farmer who only wants what's best for the produce he grows (in this case, canola), bringing a necessary emotional centre to the film. I'm not sure how accurate his accent was, as American and Canadian accents sound almost identical to me, but I did feel he did a decent enough job convincing me that he was from North of the border. It was also nice to see Christina Ricci in a supporting role, as I consider her to be highly underrated. Ricci is one of those actresses whom I've never seen give a bad performance in anything she's in, and this film is no exception. I liked how her character remained a loyal ally to Percy, even accompanying him on international ventures to promote his cause. Zach Braff, on the other hand, wasn't featured as often as he should have been. This is a shame as I enjoyed seeing his character standing up for Percy and farmers everywhere based on his own moral principles rather than for monetary reasons. He is only prominently seen during the first and final acts of the film, which leads me to believe he was likely written in as a mere afterthought.\n\nWhile the film is nothing groundbreaking, it's still a decent enough drama to hold one's attention for its short duration of 99 minutes. It proudly wears its anti-capitalist morals on its sleeve so anyone who likes movies that try to "stick it to the man" should derive enough entertainment from something like this. As for me, I liked the acting the most, mainly from Walken and Ricci, so I hope those two will work together on something else in the future.\n\nI rate it 6.5/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1537,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-04-30","keywords":"farmer,organic farmer,cross contamination,lawsuit,courtroom","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Percy Vs Goliath Official US Trailer (2021)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi260423705","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlZTEwZGUtNmZjYi00MjkwLThjYTMtNWU4NDg0MDk2MDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlZTEwZGUtNmZjYi00MjkwLThjYTMtNWU4NDg0MDk2MDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000686/","name":"Christopher Walken","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0561809/","name":"Roberta Maxwell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000207/","name":"Christina Ricci"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424800/","name":"Clark Johnson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293963/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0705676/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0141447/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2125366/","name":"Garfield Lindsay Miller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0429499/","name":"Hilary Pryor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1285700/","name":"Maureen Dorey"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The L Word is back and it's not bad at all!","reviewBody":"The L Word changed my life. I was a very confused 14 year Colombian girl living in a very small city with my very Catholic family. I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show.

Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture.\n\nNow after Shazam!, Aquaman &amp; the masterpiece Joker, DC presents us with Birds of Prey, the fourth entry movie that proves that their tables have pretty much turned around by finding suitable directors for their movies and that they are catching up to compete with the Marvel Universe. No feud here please.\n\nHere's my thoughts on Birds of Prey:\n\nThe movie features slick action scenes which complete with very acrobatic-like choreography that constantly pleases the eyes of everyone who are looking forward for femme fatales kicking ass. There are plenty of them to keep you amazed.\n\nBirds of Prey also delivers a vigorous energy throughout, it feels like you are high on drugs. The close-ups feel very intimate yet feel very caricature in a positive way. The quality of cameras &amp; the colour palette capture a reality of life, giving a sense of how rough it actually is, very dark and gritty but... also sometimes sprinkles the dour tone with graciously boisterous and delicate tinted colours. The occasional slo-mo ampes up the already intense energy.\n\nSome of you might have asked regarding the feminist movement. Birds of Prey is a done right feminist film. A key successful factor to driving a feminist film is to create an innate story on women without being pushy on the political agenda. Birds of Prey does that. Another thing is this is not a guy-turn-girl remakes (Yes, I'm watching you Ghostbusters &amp; Ocean's 8). And BOP does not or rarely knocks down the men genes as weak or indecisive. Kudos Birds of Prey!\n\nNow, let's talk about Margot Robbie &amp; Mary Elizabeth Winstead. These two really go beyond the next level to dive into their character as uniquely as possible. Margot Robbie as always should be receiving a standing ovation as Harley Quinn again, after the meh Suicide Squad. She restrains from letting anyone steals her spotlight. If her and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker are caught together in a love story, it will be the best romance movie of the decade. The complexity and different types of deranged personalities they uphold. Wow! Winstead as Huntress is the runner up here, she gives out a hot breeze of aura that it is hard to back away from. Her charismatic sexual energy captures the attention like a bullseye . Bell as Black Canary is cool, but not as great as the other two. Bella as Cain shows to be mischievous but her character only pretty much follows where the major characters take her.\n\nIt also offers decent humour overall. Harley Quinn is consciously great in this, her facial movements contribute a lot! Some are fresh from the oven, others are a bit obsolete but those humours though feel old keep us glued to the screen.\n\nFinal battle, the best thing is the lack of unrealistic weaponry that they occupy which makes it all feels so real. It is entertaining and fun too as there are certain scenes that feature a low amount of quick cuts.\n\nNow, the most detectable problem with this movie is it spends so much time on character development of the all-girls group that it forgets that they can excite the audience with the combo pack. An hour later and they are still focusing on so many character devs!\n\nBecause of this, the relationship between members of Birds of Prey is very shadowy and leaves an unsatisfied feeling by the end. Like somehow they have been forced exponentially to know and work with one another.\n\nSo many developments but they forget Roman's character, the main antagonist which feels quite underdeveloped. When a scene of him pops up especially after 40% of the film, it really wants to tell something meaningful about him, but eventually moves on with it, providing us with a lack of knowledge of what his wholesome embodies.\n\nHyena &amp; police cop. With a lack of screen time, we do not really see Hyena attacking people at all which some of you might have anticipated. Renee as the cop is one that is really bad at acting, it needs fixing. It is like watching a brick talks with try-hard emotions.\n\nWhile this centres on supervillains, Birds of Prey fails on the costume design. Not a single character clothes himself/herself as a good superhero model portrayal of a costume. It feels very lazy thus, this however tones down the great energy the movie has possessed. It is so bad that varsity students can design them better.\n\nVerdict: Imaginative &amp; darkly flamboyant, Birds of Prey proves that the comeback of DC is possible, adapting many characters into the big screen as a beacon of call to level itself with the colossal Marvel.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-02-07","keywords":"harley quinn character,police,hyena,spin off,chase","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Birds of Prey Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3883843353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMDNjMDQtNjk2ZS00ZGY4LTgzODMtOTAzOTM4MmJhOTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMDNjMDQtNjk2ZS00ZGY4LTgzODMtOTAzOTM4MmJhOTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001609/","name":"Rosie Perez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935541/","name":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4014166/","name":"Cathy Yan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0637285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0693170/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5429637/","name":"Christina Hodson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0227704/","name":"Paul Dini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0863622/","name":"Bruce Timm"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture.\n\nNow after Shazam!, Aquaman &amp; the masterpiece Joker, DC presents us with Birds of Prey, the fourth entry movie that proves that their tables have pretty much turned around by finding suitable directors for their movies and that they are catching up to compete with the Marvel Universe.

It looked different enough to distinguish itself, but similar enough to not appear vastly different. Them being adults instead of kids was interesting, and the changed-around races and jobs could have worked. Unfortunately, it's lost in a sea of expositional arguing (don't tell, show) and agenda (political, real, or pretend)-driven drama. Waited 20 minutes to start feeling something but I couldn't. Too bad, because without the forced statements and with another pass at the script, it might have had something. Maybe other less aware viewers will find something to it, but I gotta give it a pass.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11074,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Romance","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-01-15","keywords":"remake,location in series title,city name in series title,alien","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3471005/","name":"Jeanine Mason","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1452155/","name":"Nathan Parsons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4266732/","name":"Michael Vlamis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0065354/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0429120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0087778/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6092900/","name":"Carina Adly MacKenzie"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Comic-Con Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2764552985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGViMmM3NDQtNGMwOC00ZjU2LWJiYjktZjA4ZTMwMDFjMzg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMGViMmM3NDQtNGMwOC00ZjU2LWJiYjktZjA4ZTMwMDFjMzg0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Comic-Con Trailer for "Roswell, New Mexico," a new series coming to the CW."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This film also wonderfully parodies the standard conventions and cliché's of the action film genre to create an entertaining, and gleefully controversial film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":165259,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2004-10-15","keywords":"strong language,swearing,terrorist,arab stereotype,puppetry","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Team America: World Police","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1166541081","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEyYmRkYWMtZDMxYi00MmRhLThkZTYtYTgyNzg2MzEwODQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTEyYmRkYWMtZDMxYi00MmRhLThkZTYtYTgyNzg2MzEwODQ3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005295/","name":"Trey Parker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001778/","name":"Matt Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1224826/","name":"Elle Russ"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005295/","name":"Trey Parker"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152527/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005295/","name":"Trey Parker","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001778/","name":"Matt Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103702/","name":"Pam Brady"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

At the time the show really captured a certain nineties sensibility - it was cynical, tongue-in-cheek, adult. Though not your average SATC fan - heterosexual, thirty-something male working in IT - I became obsessed, and was sure to see each new episode the first time it aired. However, over time I became disillusioned with the series.\n\nFirst, I eventually read the book. Despite the author's reluctance to say anything, the show never was much like the book, and has - over the years - strayed far far away. The book is, like most of Candace Bushnell's work, insightful and witty, with its humor derived from a certain urbane severity; it shares more with the works of Carrie Fischer and Tama Janowitz than any of the stuff now labeled Chick Lit.\n\nBushnell's characters may fall in love, even marry. They may have Manolos and Birkin bags, but this is all background noise of sorts. Bushnell is an under-rated pop-anthropologist, depicting the tribes that inhabit the big city. We may no longer be hunting our food, or struggling to keep the fire going, but it is still all about survival. Bushnell is great at depicting the primal hunger that, while it once made man fight to the death over territory or a fresh kill, now makes women deck themselves out in top gear and hunt down that Banker or Fortune 500 Executive, or fight tooth-and-nail to break through the glass ceiling.\n\nSecond, somewhere midlife, SATC, the show, got lost. All that incidental stuff - the shoes and bags, and places-to-be-seen - moved from the background to the foreground. The show became one long glossy luxury goods advertisement, the kind found in Vanity Fair. The movie underlines this - while there are great story lines, etc, the theatrical release is one obscene orgy of consumerism and decadence.\n\nToo bad. The last years of SATC is an insult to both the book and the early years of the show. It is certainly an insult to the public, but - considering SATC was most popular in its later years - maybe the insult is much deserved.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114914,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-06-06","keywords":"friendship between women,friendship,love life,casual sex,new york city","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000326/","name":"Kim Cattrall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004862/","name":"Kristin Davis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020963/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050436/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823015/","name":"Darren Star"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sex and the City: The Sixth Season - Part 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi394723609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Then, came David Ayer with a set of the best movie trailers ever created but the outcome for the anti-hero film, Suicide Squad was at best, a mediocre motion picture.\n\nNow after Shazam!, Aquaman &amp; the masterpiece Joker, DC presents us with Birds of Prey, the fourth entry movie that proves that their tables have pretty much turned around by finding suitable directors for their movies and that they are catching up to compete with the Marvel Universe. No feud here please.\n\nHere's my thoughts on Birds of Prey:\n\nThe movie features slick action scenes which complete with very acrobatic-like choreography that constantly pleases the eyes of everyone who are looking forward for femme fatales kicking ass. There are plenty of them to keep you amazed.\n\nBirds of Prey also delivers a vigorous energy throughout, it feels like you are high on drugs. The close-ups feel very intimate yet feel very caricature in a positive way. The quality of cameras &amp; the colour palette capture a reality of life, giving a sense of how rough it actually is, very dark and gritty but... also sometimes sprinkles the dour tone with graciously boisterous and delicate tinted colours. The occasional slo-mo ampes up the already intense energy.\n\nSome of you might have asked regarding the feminist movement. Birds of Prey is a done right feminist film. A key successful factor to driving a feminist film is to create an innate story on women without being pushy on the political agenda. Birds of Prey does that. Another thing is this is not a guy-turn-girl remakes (Yes, I'm watching you Ghostbusters &amp; Ocean's 8). And BOP does not or rarely knocks down the men genes as weak or indecisive. Kudos Birds of Prey!\n\nNow, let's talk about Margot Robbie &amp; Mary Elizabeth Winstead. These two really go beyond the next level to dive into their character as uniquely as possible. Margot Robbie as always should be receiving a standing ovation as Harley Quinn again, after the meh Suicide Squad. She restrains from letting anyone steals her spotlight. If her and Joaquin Phoenix's Joker are caught together in a love story, it will be the best romance movie of the decade. The complexity and different types of deranged personalities they uphold. Wow! Winstead as Huntress is the runner up here, she gives out a hot breeze of aura that it is hard to back away from. Her charismatic sexual energy captures the attention like a bullseye . Bell as Black Canary is cool, but not as great as the other two. Bella as Cain shows to be mischievous but her character only pretty much follows where the major characters take her.\n\nIt also offers decent humour overall. Harley Quinn is consciously great in this, her facial movements contribute a lot! Some are fresh from the oven, others are a bit obsolete but those humours though feel old keep us glued to the screen.\n\nFinal battle, the best thing is the lack of unrealistic weaponry that they occupy which makes it all feels so real. It is entertaining and fun too as there are certain scenes that feature a low amount of quick cuts.\n\nNow, the most detectable problem with this movie is it spends so much time on character development of the all-girls group that it forgets that they can excite the audience with the combo pack. An hour later and they are still focusing on so many character devs!\n\nBecause of this, the relationship between members of Birds of Prey is very shadowy and leaves an unsatisfied feeling by the end. Like somehow they have been forced exponentially to know and work with one another.\n\nSo many developments but they forget Roman's character, the main antagonist which feels quite underdeveloped. When a scene of him pops up especially after 40% of the film, it really wants to tell something meaningful about him, but eventually moves on with it, providing us with a lack of knowledge of what his wholesome embodies.\n\nHyena &amp; police cop. With a lack of screen time, we do not really see Hyena attacking people at all which some of you might have anticipated. Renee as the cop is one that is really bad at acting, it needs fixing. It is like watching a brick talks with try-hard emotions.\n\nWhile this centres on supervillains, Birds of Prey fails on the costume design. Not a single character clothes himself/herself as a good superhero model portrayal of a costume. It feels very lazy thus, this however tones down the great energy the movie has possessed. It is so bad that varsity students can design them better.\n\nVerdict: Imaginative &amp; darkly flamboyant, Birds of Prey proves that the comeback of DC is possible, adapting many characters into the big screen as a beacon of call to level itself with the colossal Marvel.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":213675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-02-07","keywords":"harley quinn character,police,hyena,spin off,chase","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Birds of Prey Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3883843353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMDNjMDQtNjk2ZS00ZGY4LTgzODMtOTAzOTM4MmJhOTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmMDNjMDQtNjk2ZS00ZGY4LTgzODMtOTAzOTM4MmJhOTYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001609/","name":"Rosie Perez"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935541/","name":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4014166/","name":"Cathy Yan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0637285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0693170/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5429637/","name":"Christina Hodson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0227704/","name":"Paul Dini"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0863622/","name":"Bruce Timm"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, however, is just that. The incredibly realistic characters and beautifully rendered backdrops in this movie make it a fascinating work of CGI. Unfortunately, its story falls short of anything but a rather boring Sci-Fi plot, which I'm sure is what caused it to be such a failure in the box-office.\n\nThe Spirits Within follows a young scientist named Aki Ross, who shares a belief with her colleague Dr. Sid that with the collection of 7 spirits they can stop an invading alien race and save the earth. Being a fan of the video game series of the same name, I remember getting pretty excited for this movie when it first came out. After seeing it for the first time, I could not figure out why in the world they would call this movie "Final Fantasy". Aside from a few subtle references to characters and themes from the video game series, it does not contain enough blatant similarities to possess the Final Fantasy title, and I feel like this should have been a more important goal in directing this movie. It was a great choice to have done this movie in CGI rather than in live-action, as one of the most captivating things about the Final Fantasy series are its fantastic cinematic scenes. To have a whole movie based on the quality of an epic Final Fantasy cinematic really shows the hard work that goes into creating all of these scenes. Every model in the movie displays a high level of detail from the main characters to the ships that they fly in. The freckles on Ross's face allow for intense close-ups. The subtle movements of their facial structures make them more interesting to look at. It's an art form that was very well presented in this film. In fact, this was the first full CGI film to feature fully realistic characters, modeled to look like real actors. The fact that it is a computer generated movie allows more freedom to conduct scenes and also set camera angles in places that would be impossible to get if it were shot in real life.\n\nFinal Fantasy: The Spirits Within portrays a mastery of computer generated imagery for its time. It's a fine tribute to the wonderful cinematics of the Final Fantasy series. But it doesn't possess a very original plot line, which doesn't even portray enough references to be called Final Fantasy, and should have just been another Sci-fi called "The Spirits Within".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":81317,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2001-10-31","keywords":"based on video game,motion capture,profanity,weapons fire,movie flop","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi715587865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q4NmRlYmItYTA1Yy00MjI0LTliODktY2UzMWU4OTg4MDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q4NmRlYmItYTA1Yy00MjI0LTliODktY2UzMWU4OTg4MDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Columbia Tristar"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000114/","name":"Steve Buscemi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001840/","name":"Ming-Na Wen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0756983/","name":"Hironobu Sakaguchi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012102/","name":"Motonori Sakakibara"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012408/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035851/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040831/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0756983/","name":"Hironobu Sakaguchi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718031/","name":"Al Reinert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0899113/","name":"Jeff Vintar"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The L Word is back and it's not bad at all!","reviewBody":"The L Word changed my life. I was a very confused 14 year Colombian girl living in a very small city with my very Catholic family. I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show. Just don't watch it if you don't like it but you can't say it's not a great deal for our community and for us, lesbians.\n\nLesbian, from Lesbos. The origin of the L word is beautiful.

The L Word is back and it's not bad at all!","reviewBody":"The L Word changed my life. I was a very confused 14 year Colombian girl living in a very small city with my very Catholic family. I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show. Just don't watch it if you don't like it but you can't say it's not a great deal for our community and for us, lesbians.\n\nLesbian, from Lesbos. The origin of the L word is beautiful. Read about Sappho, read her poems. We should be proud of it and we should celebrate it.\n\nWe need more shows like this.

With his gadgets expert in tow, Gibbons turns to a new Triple X agent to help him fight this threat  former comrade and now life prisoner, Darius Stone. Busting Stone out of prison, Gibbons arms him and helps him start his new mission by uncovering hidden information; as the danger increases, so does the pace and all clues lead to something very sinister indeed.\n\nThe production company credits right at the start of the film proclaim this as an "Original Films Production", a claim that I thought highly ironic since it then plunges into a pre-credit sequence that is as genre-specific as they come, a title sequence that is a clear Bond rip off and a film that delivers nothing more than the genre basics. Taking the lead from the first film, the script kills off Xander Cage with barely a mention and moves on to the new agent. Discussion of the plot is pointless cause the whole affair is nonsense with logic holes so large that you could drive a souped up car through it. Those looking to this for a story that they can get into will be sorely disappointed as the film throws its energy into noise, explosions and typically OTT action scenes. To me and many viewers this will be just annoying hollow spectacle but to the target audience this is all they require and xXx2 does do it noisily enough to satisfy them.\n\nThe action is as stupid and illogical as the plot itself but it is noisy, stupid, big and bold and is enjoyable on that level; it is a shame that it lacks any actual tension or excitement but the noise will be enough for the target audience. At times it all gets a bit much and just looks plain silly but it never really stops moving that long so the next boom or bang is only ever minutes away, preventing you turning your brain on. The attempts at character and story are the worst  the moments with the girls really slows things down without adding even titillation value, while the potentially brave political stance made by the drawing of the president is just lost and wasted. Ice Cube picks up the mantle and delivers a one-note performance where he basically sneers his way across the screen; he lacks any sort of charisma here and could have been any old actor (something I think those hoping to make a franchise hope will be the case). Jackson is just collecting the cash so his bad performance can be ignored but Dafoe is a terrible bad guy considering he has done it well in other films. Xzibit doesn't do much but will draw humour from the MTV teenage audience thanks to his "Pimp my Ride" personae being called on. Mabrey and Gayle are basically just eye candy, with breasts squeezed and lifted in every scene  they can't act and don't have any chemistry with the basic Cube. The support cast do lots of running around with guns or diving away form bangs but nobody gets close to a performance.\n\nOverall this is a noisy genre flick, nothing more and nothing less. Those claiming how awful it is forget that there are people who don't want art films, emotional films or engaging dramas, they just want to whoop and holler as things get blowing up in fancy-looking ways. For them, and them alone, this film will do the job as it provides effects, stunts and noise.

Great things are coming from this filmmaker.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60338,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Fantasy","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2012-03-02","keywords":"psychic,revelation,obsession,younger version of character,road trip","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3842417177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ4NzcyNTYwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc5ODg4MjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ4NzcyNTYwNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTc5ODg4MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Psychologist Margaret Matheson and her assistant study paranormal activity, which leads them to investigate a world-renowned psychic who has resurfaced years after his toughest critic mysteriously passed away.

In fact, I boosted my rating. Since my first viewing, I have seen a couple of biographical movies about Albert Einstein, and that gave me a framework for better appreciating some of the humor. I own the DVD and, while it has no extras, it is a very nice presentation, and the sound is Dolby 5.1. There was a scene with birds twittering in the surround speakers, thoroughly confusing my cat, Bullet.\n\nSet in the 1950s, when Eisenhower was president, and both the US and Russia were in a race of sorts to explore space, Tim Robbins plays a mechanic who likes to read astronomy and science for fun. Meg Ryan plays a mathematician who isn't quite sure of herself, and Matthau plays Albert Einstein, her uncle. In a round-about way, Einstein and his fellow Physicists play matchmaker, and try to get Ryan and Robbins together. This is simply a wonderful romantic comedy with no swearing, no sex, and very little innuendo."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24796,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1994-12-25","keywords":"genius,mechanic,laboratory animal,man wears eyeglasses,initialism in title","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000209/","name":"Tim Robbins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000212/","name":"Meg Ryan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000527/","name":"Walter Matthau"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770961/","name":"Fred Schepisi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026441/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0106563/","name":"Andy Breckman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498775/","name":"Michael Leeson"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In fact, I boosted my rating. Since my first viewing, I have seen a couple of biographical movies about Albert Einstein, and that gave me a framework for better appreciating some of the humor. I own the DVD and, while it has no extras, it is a very nice presentation, and the sound is Dolby 5.1. There was a scene with birds twittering in the surround speakers, thoroughly confusing my cat, Bullet.\n\nSet in the 1950s, when Eisenhower was president, and both the US and Russia were in a race of sorts to explore space, Tim Robbins plays a mechanic who likes to read astronomy and science for fun. Meg Ryan plays a mathematician who isn't quite sure of herself, and Matthau plays Albert Einstein, her uncle. In a round-about way, Einstein and his fellow Physicists play matchmaker, and try to get Ryan and Robbins together. This is simply a wonderful romantic comedy with no swearing, no sex, and very little innuendo.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24796,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"1994-12-25","keywords":"genius,mechanic,laboratory animal,man wears eyeglasses,initialism in title","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000209/","name":"Tim Robbins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000212/","name":"Meg Ryan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000527/","name":"Walter Matthau"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770961/","name":"Fred Schepisi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026441/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0106563/","name":"Andy Breckman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498775/","name":"Michael Leeson"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The cast is still good in their roles. Derek and Hansel are still the same characters and they play them with enthusiasm and Mugatu is well, OK. Sadly, everything else is pretty much garbage. The humor did not work at all and I just wanted it to be over. After 5 minutes of the movie I was just exhausted. This is a clear example that bigger does not mean better. I am a fan of the original Zoolander and one of the things I liked about that film is that it was just a small comedy with a relatively small budget and it evolved as a cult film. Zoolander 2 tries to be bigger than the first one and it just doesn't work. The first was pretty much about Mugatu trying to hypnotize a male model to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia. That was the plot. Stupid? Definitely, but it worked in its own right. This one's about Derek trying to locate his son, while male models are being assassinated, which actually did not pay off at all in the end. \n\nThe movie is filled with unnecessary cameos and there can be too much of a good thing. It happened last year with the Entourage movie and now with this. Like I said, everything is bigger, the scope and even the effects, but what Stiller and his production crew don't get is that what made the original Zoolander so funny and good was that it seemed like they were taking a chance. It was kind of cheap and small but it worked.\n\nThe film doesn't work at all but I'll say this: At least it didn't feel cynical. To me it seemed like they were actually trying to make a good film and a funny one but it just did not work. The humor is mostly like people getting hit in the face and stuff like that. The movie also tries way too hard to recall on things from the original that were funny. As a fan of the original and as a moviegoer in general, I would not recommend Zoolander 2. I laughed 5 times in the whole movie. I counted them. And as a comedy that's the main problem with the movie: It was not funny.\n\n1.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67429,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-02-24","keywords":"absurdism,overweight child,model,modeling,fashion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1139323417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDU2MTkxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyMTgzNzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUzMDU2MTkxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyMTgzNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Derek and Hansel team up with an Interpol agent to find out who is behind the deaths of the world's biggest pop stars."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004851/","name":"Penélope Cruz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0094563/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039303/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0857620/","name":"Justin Theroux"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831557/","name":"Nicholas Stoller"}],"duration":"PT1H41M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Though as commercial and formula-driven as it is, the movie's not a rehash but a fertile piece, based on a Patterson book about a criminal who, the Freeman character perceives, is not killing his quarries, but accumulating them. Often said by moviegoers to be the actor whose presence has the most authority of any of his generation, Freeman has an exceptional bearing on the screen, a particular determination that we believe. He never looks or sound like he's pretending. He never gives a superficial, obvious or distracted impression, and even in movies that aren't that good, he's not guilty by association: You feel he's genuine even as a film may capsize around him.\n\nFreeman plays Patterson's pet character Alex Cross, a forensic psychologist with the Washington, D.C., police, who becomes entrenched in a chain of kidnappings in North Carolina. When his own niece is taken, he flies there and calls on the police department, where he's kept waiting for hours until he ultimately barges into the office of the chief. The victims are being taken by a man who inscribes himself "Casanova," and one of his victims is found dead tied to a tree and "left for the critters to find." Cross questions why there aren't more bodies, and speculates that Casanova is a collector who kills only when he believes he needs to. His niece and her fellow captives must still be alive somewhere. His hypothesis is certified by what comes of extraordinarily sexy local doctor Ashley Judd, who also gives the sometimes humdrum drama a helping of forceful energy.\n\nAnd what Freeman brings to all of his scenes is a really specific thoughtfulness. He doesn't just listen, he appears to cogitate what he is told, to gauge it. That masterful attribute begets a funny outcome, when other actors will tell him something and then stop to see if he trusts it. And Judd shows us such a boldly defined personality, which makes their dialogue scenes, after she's been developed for awhile, engrossing.\n\nKiss the Girls was directed by Gary Fleder, whose first feature, Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead, boasted skill but too much artifice. Here he's more careful and restrained, with a story where the shades and details are as chilling as anything else. Here as in Seven, we get a steady feeling of not being able to see everything we believe we want to, as in a chase through the woods which Fleder makes effectively tense through its efficient use of space, never revealing the distance between victim and pursuer.\n\nWhen the film is over and we know all of its enigmas, there's one we'd like to know more about: What precisely are particulars of the histrionics between the two most nefarious characters? But being left with such a wringer is much more fulfilling in a way than being given the explanation in the conventional fast-sketch Freudian description. What we're also left with is the genuine feeling of having met two authentically defined people in the leads. Freeman and Judd are so good, you almost wish they'd chosen not to make a thriller at all, had just discovered a way to create a drama really sinking their teeth into their characterizations. All things considered, I would've preferred that movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":70817,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1997-10-03","keywords":"detective,kidnapping,escape,serial killer,tied to a tree","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000144/","name":"Cary Elwes"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001219/","name":"Gary Fleder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030480/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0666248/","name":"James Patterson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458318/","name":"David Klass"}],"duration":"PT1H55M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nolte has hired Luis Guzman, a local police officer, to help him in this pursuit and to smooth things over when Nolte disrespects the local populace or their customs. Finally, Valeria Henriquez is quite engaging as the young charmer Lena, who is desperate to join her sister in Minnesota (sold online to a family when they were both in a church orphanage) and will even team up with the "padre" to get there.\n\nWith this good cast and storyline I guess I expected more from this movie, but it lacked dramatic tension and suspense and came across as too flat-toned.

    <desc lang="pl">Bok, ein Ferengi, will sich an Picard rächen, der in einem schon lange zurückliegenden Krieg Boks Sohn getötet hat. Nun droht er, im Gegenzug Picards Sohn zu ermorden. Der Captain ist zunächst völlig überrascht, doch dann findet er heraus, dass ihn eine kurze Affäre vor 24 Jahren tatsächlich zum Vater gemacht hat. Nur wenig später muss er bereits um das Leben seines Sohnes Jason fürchten, der von Bok verschleppt wurde.</desc>
