I've been a fan of Bruce Lee all my life. I've read almost every book, every documentary and seen all his films at least 6 times. Nothing new about Lee's life was revealed in this documentary. It was just old stuff repeated with the views of modern MMA fighters and film actors talking about how Lee inspired them.\n\nThe only poignant moment for me was hearing Dan Inosanto speak so fondly of Lee and clearly how upset he is by Lee's death.\n\nIf you are new to Bruce Lee and a fan of MMA then you will enjoy this. Otherwise nothing new or revealing to be found in this new documentary.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Documentary","Biography"],"datePublished":"2012-02-09","keywords":"martial arts,interview,actor,martial artist,celebrity interview","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"BL Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi361668889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ2Mjk1NDMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjgyMzQyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODQ2Mjk1NDMyMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjgyMzQyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Today's athletes, entertainers, filmmakers, and others describe the powerful legacy of Bruce Lee.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000045/","name":"Bruce Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4863065/","name":"Paul Bowman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4863066/","name":"Daniele Bolelli"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1157811/","name":"Pete McCormack"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0427587/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190365/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1157811/","name":"Pete McCormack"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That's not far from the truth. Limbs are hacked clean off, stomachs are regularly impaled and the claret fluid sprays endlessly. Though the major difference is where Tarantino's homage to the old chop-socky movies from Eastern cinema is cartoonish in its bloody visuals, Centurion is anything but tongue-in-cheek; here the blood, sweat and tears seep into the muddy vistas and bucolic rivers of Great Britain to intensify the atmosphere.\n\nDirector Neil Marshall (The Descent) has crafted a gritty movie that at its core is a simple 'cat and mouse' tale – and a highly entertaining one at that – but becomes much more thanks to the efficacious work from all the cast and crew. Marshall himself executes a few impressive sequences, the most outstanding being the initial ambush on the Ninth Legion, showing once again he knows how to stretch a small budget with minimalistic techniques and a passionate approach. Director of photography Sam McCurdy provides a suitably grimy and grainy look that, although at times is too dim, sets the ideal tone for the film. Perhaps Marshall should have monitored the editing closer though, Chris Gill's frenetic cutting very nearly ruins a couple of the fight scenes.\n\nMajor Hollywood star in the waiting Michael Fassbender (played the German-impersonating British Lieutentant in Inglourious Basterds) is undoubtedly the standout among the acting contingent.

 --- Description: Centurion: Directed by Neil Marshall. With Michael Fassbender, Andreas Wisniewski, Dave Legeno, Axelle Carolyn. A splinter group of Roman soldiers fight for their lives behind enemy lines after their legion is devastated in a guerrilla attack." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1020558/","name":"Centurion","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NTI1MTEzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDc3NDc1Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A splinter group of Roman soldiers fight for their lives behind enemy lines after their legion is devastated in a guerrilla attack.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1020558/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Troy_Campbell","dateCreated":"2010-07-30","inLanguage":"English","name":"A grubby, gory delight.","reviewBody":"When the final credits were rolling my regular cinema-going counterpart observed "that was one of the most outwardly violent films I've seen since Kill Bill". That's not far from the truth. Limbs are hacked clean off, stomachs are regularly impaled and the claret fluid sprays endlessly. Though the major difference is where Tarantino's homage to the old chop-socky movies from Eastern cinema is cartoonish in its bloody visuals, Centurion is anything but tongue-in-cheek; here the blood, sweat and tears seep into the muddy vistas and bucolic rivers of Great Britain to intensify the atmosphere.\n\nDirector Neil Marshall (The Descent) has crafted a gritty movie that at its core is a simple 'cat and mouse' tale – and a highly entertaining one at that – but becomes much more thanks to the efficacious work from all the cast and crew. Marshall himself executes a few impressive sequences, the most outstanding being the initial ambush on the Ninth Legion, showing once again he knows how to stretch a small budget with minimalistic techniques and a passionate approach. Director of photography Sam McCurdy provides a suitably grimy and grainy look that, although at times is too dim, sets the ideal tone for the film. Perhaps Marshall should have monitored the editing closer though, Chris Gill's frenetic cutting very nearly ruins a couple of the fight scenes.\n\nMajor Hollywood star in the waiting Michael Fassbender (played the German-impersonating British Lieutentant in Inglourious Basterds) is undoubtedly the standout among the acting contingent. As the titular soldier, Fassbender makes for a charismatic leading man that convinces in both the physical and dramatic elements of the role. I eagerly wait to see what he does as the young Magneto in the upcoming X-Men prequel.

I watch this regularly, especially at times when the reality of life is overwhelming, just to refocus and regain some sense of perspective.\n\nEverything in this film works toward one end: to transform the adult sense of fear back into the childlike sense of wonder at the world. From the very opening moments of the film, designed to create confusion and startlement, this movie creates a sensation of dread and foreboding. The dissonance of the soundtrack, the juxtaposition of images, they all are working to build into the viewer a feeling that something just isn't right, that something out of the ordinary is taking place, and underscoring this all with a sense that this is something to resist, to pull away from, to not allow it to affect one's "ordinary life." \n\nBut as the movie progresses, the tone begins to shift, and the true intent of the film begins to peek through. This isn't about being afraid of the unknown, but rather embracing it. Paying attention to the "subliminal images" in life, allowing them to lead you into something unknown and perhaps dangerous, only then can one be open to wonder and experience the world through the magical eyes of a child.\n\nDreyfuss' character takes us on this journey, met with resistance all along the way. His wife, his neighbors, his job, his community, all are working against him, and it's only when he's reached his craziest that he truly gives in and begins to stop trying to understand and instead embraces the experiences in store for him. The scientific community is seeking to understand, but without having any personal calling to be involved. Only Barry is truly able to throw himself into the strangeness that is taking place, and his enthusiasm is greeted by both the characters and the audience as somehow alien and threatening.\n\nThe ending of this film, when all the fear is finally stripped away and the sense of amazed wonder overtakes everyone on the screen and in the audience, brings about an amazing catharsis. Discarding all the "adult" sensibilities and being able to approach life once again with a sense of innocent amazement for the Strange hidden amongst the Ordinary, one can begin again to approach life from a fresh vantage point. \n\nPowerful, mystifying, and rejuvenating.

Set presumably some time after Day of the Dead, the plot focuses on a human population that has managed to survive by barricading themselves within the "remains" of Pittsburgh by means of guards and electrified fences (as well as rivers that are bordering the city). The rich reside in a tower called Fiddler's Green but everyone else is forced to live in the streets, with only the false hope of being able to attain high-class status.\n\nOne guy dissatisfied with living in the streets, Cholo (John Leguizamo), doesn't take kindly to the mayor's (Dennis Hopper) refusal, especially having been his lackey for three years with the expectation of reward. So Cholo steals the armored vehicle Dead Reckoning and threatens to destroy Fiddler's Green unless he gets his five million dollars (which is the amount needed to get high-class status, but did he really expect to be welcomed into Fiddler's Green with open arms after this incident?). Refusing to cooperate, the mayor hires Riley (Simon Baker) to bring Dead Reckoning back. Meanwhile, the undead are planning to invade the city thanks to the evolving zombie called Big Daddy, and given this couldn't happen at a worst possible time, you can guess what'll happen next.\n\nI'm going to put it bluntly, this film is by far the worst of Romero's zombie movies, lacking in so many ways that I would still feel the same way even if I didn't have its predecessors to compare it with. But there are its predecessors, and having already seen three prior films in which characters must hold off scores of zombies at bay from inside some "safe" location before it's ultimately penetrated by the undead, let's just say seeing this a fourth time gets a little repetitive.\n\nThe film does have elements worth appreciating, the cinematography is excellent and easily the best of the series; I especially loved the stylish and creepy nighttime shot of zombies shuffling within a fog-shrouded forest. The movie is also the most action-packed of the series, so the non-stop gunfire keeps the movie watchable. The production values are also pretty good considering the budgetary limitations (some of the f/x still look pretty weak, though).\n\nOtherwise, LOTD is rushed, unfulfilling, and does little its predecessors haven't already accomplished. What new material it does aim for is poorly conceived, a shocker considering Romero's had twenty years to mull over this material. Take the city, for instance, it's never fully explained how the monetary system works or where the electricity is coming from. I was able to suspend my disbelief for the latter in Dawn of the Dead, but I'm not willing to let Romero pull the same trick twice, especially when the inner workings of the city should have been further explored. \n\nThe movie's social commentary feels like a slapdash effort of contemporary issues tossed together without any real coherency, with characters acting in blatantly idiotic fashion for no other purpose than to continue serving the commentary. The original Dawn of the Dead's commentary on consumerism worked because it was a natural outgrowth of the way the characters' believably behaved (if you had free reign to a mall, you likely wouldn't want to leave, would you?).\n\nYet here, Romero feels compelled to ensure that Hopper's character won't dare negotiate, even preferring to leave the city (to go where exactly?) and kill an associate rather than give up five million bucks. To keep the commentary going, Romero even has Hopper take all his cash with him, even though I had to wonder what it was good for. Considering his demands, the same problem also applies to Cholo. Are there other cities/outposts out there using the same currency as well? If so, why not at least mention it so we don't question the characters' motivations, especially considering it's the basic framework that leads to so many deaths later in the film.\n\nThere are further instances of stupidity, such as Riley choosing not to warn anyone inside the city about Big Daddy. The soldiers protecting the city prove incompetent in almost every fashion, with one guard actually rappelling into a crowd of zombies. Later in the film, there's even a guy who wears headphones while he's outside the city, by himself, and not at all far from known zombie territory. This scene is also indicative of the countless jump scares Romero attempts, all of them obvious and hilariously overdone.\n\nAs for the zombies, there's the storyline involving Big Daddy, an undead gas station attendant who's inexplicably getting smarter. Much of the appeal of zombies is seeing them act out as mindless drones with no other motivation than to eat human flesh. That Big Daddy is able to think and seems to actually want revenge for his fallen zombie brethren completely mutes the sense of dread and terror that came with zombies acting on just pure instinct. \n\nMost astoundingly, Romero takes this a step further and actually wants us to sympathize with the zombies. I shouldn't be surprised by this development, as it's all been clearly leading up to this point since Bub's humanity in Day of the Dead and the constant "they're us, we're them" lines. Doesn't mean I have to like it, especially when the previous installments have made it clear being a zombie isn't something to cherish and the general fact that they like to eat people doesn't exactly make me want to side with them. For me, LOTD continues Romero's downward spiral, and I still haven't liked a movie of his since the 80s."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94659,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-08-24","keywords":"zombie apocalypse,post apocalypse,zombie film,zombie survival,survival horror","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Land of the Dead","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1419051289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZhYWUxMDQtNWMzOC00ZjM2LWI2ZWEtNjliNzU5YjEwYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZhYWUxMDQtNWMzOC00ZjM2LWI2ZWEtNjliNzU5YjEwYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000491/","name":"John Leguizamo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000782/","name":"Asia Argento"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048932/","name":"Simon Baker"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

The production values are also pretty good considering the budgetary limitations (some of the f/x still look pretty weak, though).\n\nOtherwise, LOTD is rushed, unfulfilling, and does little its predecessors haven't already accomplished. What new material it does aim for is poorly conceived, a shocker considering Romero's had twenty years to mull over this material. Take the city, for instance, it's never fully explained how the monetary system works or where the electricity is coming from. I was able to suspend my disbelief for the latter in Dawn of the Dead, but I'm not willing to let Romero pull the same trick twice, especially when the inner workings of the city should have been further explored. \n\nThe movie's social commentary feels like a slapdash effort of contemporary issues tossed together without any real coherency, with characters acting in blatantly idiotic fashion for no other purpose than to continue serving the commentary. The original Dawn of the Dead's commentary on consumerism worked because it was a natural outgrowth of the way the characters' believably behaved (if you had free reign to a mall, you likely wouldn't want to leave, would you?).\n\nYet here, Romero feels compelled to ensure that Hopper's character won't dare negotiate, even preferring to leave the city (to go where exactly?) and kill an associate rather than give up five million bucks. To keep the commentary going, Romero even has Hopper take all his cash with him, even though I had to wonder what it was good for. Considering his demands, the same problem also applies to Cholo. Are there other cities/outposts out there using the same currency as well? If so, why not at least mention it so we don't question the characters' motivations, especially considering it's the basic framework that leads to so many deaths later in the film.\n\nThere are further instances of stupidity, such as Riley choosing not to warn anyone inside the city about Big Daddy. The soldiers protecting the city prove incompetent in almost every fashion, with one guard actually rappelling into a crowd of zombies. Later in the film, there's even a guy who wears headphones while he's outside the city, by himself, and not at all far from known zombie territory. This scene is also indicative of the countless jump scares Romero attempts, all of them obvious and hilariously overdone.\n\nAs for the zombies, there's the storyline involving Big Daddy, an undead gas station attendant who's inexplicably getting smarter. Much of the appeal of zombies is seeing them act out as mindless drones with no other motivation than to eat human flesh. That Big Daddy is able to think and seems to actually want revenge for his fallen zombie brethren completely mutes the sense of dread and terror that came with zombies acting on just pure instinct. \n\nMost astoundingly, Romero takes this a step further and actually wants us to sympathize with the zombies. I shouldn't be surprised by this development, as it's all been clearly leading up to this point since Bub's humanity in Day of the Dead and the constant "they're us, we're them" lines. Doesn't mean I have to like it, especially when the previous installments have made it clear being a zombie isn't something to cherish and the general fact that they like to eat people doesn't exactly make me want to side with them. For me, LOTD continues Romero's downward spiral, and I still haven't liked a movie of his since the 80s.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":94659,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2005-08-24","keywords":"zombie apocalypse,post apocalypse,zombie film,zombie survival,survival horror","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Land of the Dead","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1419051289","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZhYWUxMDQtNWMzOC00ZjM2LWI2ZWEtNjliNzU5YjEwYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODZhYWUxMDQtNWMzOC00ZjM2LWI2ZWEtNjliNzU5YjEwYThlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000491/","name":"John Leguizamo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000782/","name":"Asia Argento","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0048932/","name":"Simon Baker"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001681/","name":"George A.

Maybe I just stopped watching too soon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1625,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2004-03-13","keywords":"creature feature,fish,growth hormone,mounted fish,animal death","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0008533/","name":"Alistair Abell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009002/","name":"Doug Abrahams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000745/","name":"Carol Alt"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956484/","name":"Paul Ziller"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017447/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0169785/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043059/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338668/","name":"Anthony L.

Costumes, made by wives and girlfriends of the actors during their spare time and weapons bought on Amazon market (in section of toys for 6-12 y.o. kids).

It doesn't take itself seriously and you watch it with smile on your face whole time trough.\n\nActors can't act, surroundings look cheap, screenplay is uber-simple and still it's pretty easy to enjoy it. (only if you have correct expectations).\n\nFor the plus side... fighting scenes are well choreographed in fact.\n\nI wouldn't want to rate this movie. It won't be fair, because as a MOVIE - it deserves nothing, but as a home-video of friends who decided to roleplay and capture it on camera, this thing is really great.\n\nNext time I will have free 100$ in my pocket, I may go shoot the sequel of it."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":469,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.5},"genre":["Action","Fantasy"],"keywords":"sword and sorcery","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444098/","name":"Dominic Keating"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751638/","name":"James Russo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290969/","name":"Jason David Frank"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3012243/","name":"Tom Stout"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697935/","name":"David A.

Just watch this movie.\n\nUnpretentious, cheap, Z-Grade Fantasy movie with cliché plot with twist in the end. Costumes, made by wives and girlfriends of the actors during their spare time and weapons bought on Amazon market (in section of toys for 6-12 y.o. kids). As bad as it sounds, this movie is in fact good. It never sells itself as something superb or high-class. It doesn't take itself seriously and you watch it with smile on your face whole time trough.\n\nActors can't act, surroundings look cheap, screenplay is uber-simple and still it's pretty easy to enjoy it. (only if you have correct expectations).\n\nFor the plus side... fighting scenes are well choreographed in fact.\n\nI wouldn't want to rate this movie. It won't be fair, because as a MOVIE - it deserves nothing, but as a home-video of friends who decided to roleplay and capture it on camera, this thing is really great.\n\nNext time I will have free 100$ in my pocket, I may go shoot the sequel of it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":469,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":2.5,"genre":["Action","Fantasy"],"keywords":"sword and sorcery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444098/","name":"Dominic Keating","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751638/","name":"James Russo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290969/","name":"Jason David Frank"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3012243/","name":"Tom Stout"],"creator":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697935/","name":"David A.

It doesn't pack the punch that those movies have and is more subdued in its delivery, but the pacing is impeccable and there is barely a moment in the entire runtime that is even a momentary letdown, which is rare. Donnie Brasco goes in a different direction than these films, focusing distinctly on the impact the job has on Joe Pistone's marriage, as well as the relationship he unionizes with "Lefty", in a groundbreaking role by Al Pacino, who plays an over-the-hill, stagnated, and somewhat desperate, made mafia member who feels unappreciated and disrespected to a level that deep down inside he wants out of it.\n\nNot only are the performances all solid throughout, particularly from Pacino, Ann Hesche, Michael Madsen, and Depp, but the writing is excellent and the musical score is emotionally stunning. Anyone who is a fan of the genre or classic movies in general will definitely not regret watching Donnie Brasco, a top 25 movie here.

He does this to avoid the terminators of the future being able to find him and kill him.  In absence of him, Skynet sends back a T-X to kill secondary targets  Connor's future lieutenants, among them Kate Brewster, daughter of military scientist Robert Brewster.  Luckily, in the future, Kate has sent back a captured Terminator to protect them.  As the group escape Connor learns more of judgement day and sets out to try and stop it again.\n\nT3 is different from T2 in that it isn't really in the same league (IMO) as T2 was when it came out.  In my view T2 was the must see movie of it's time whereas now it has faded a little and is secondary to the matrix and other cutting edge blockbusters.  In fact so second was it that I wasn't that bothered about seeing it or not.  However I'm glad it did as T3 is nicely paced, doesn't expect too much of itself and does just what a blockbuster is meant to be  be entertaining.\n\nThe plot is mostly secondary to the action but, basically, the T-X has been sent back to take out a group of people before it then (accidentally) finds it's primary target of John Connor.  Some of the plot is a little tenuous but it doesn't matter as it moves along at such a pace that you don't have time to really think too long about any one scene.  However the climax is a hark back to the original Terminator with a down deep and depressing ending where fate manages to happen regardless of Connor's best intentions.\n\nThe action is great although it does look basic beside the effects of Matrix etc.  I did feel that they worked better by not trying to be overly flashy or fancy.  The morphing effects are actually more enjoyable because here they make up part of the action whereas in T2 they were key moments of cutting edge technology.  The film's action takes the form of a simple chase and is very effective, the multiple car chase is my favourite scene  partly because it shows how very out classed the Terminator is by the new model!\n\nThe direction is good and Cameron isn't missed at all.  Mostow does a great job with the action scenes and keeps everything just perfect. Because the film realises that the franchise is build on catch phrases and images that have entered into popular culture so much that they are overused, it wisely chooses to mock itself and has a real nice sense of humour to it.  For example the original Terminator had the terminator entering a motor cycle bar and exiting dressed in biker leathers, here he enters a bar and finds a ladies night in full swing and has to get his clothes from a gay stripper. The deadpan way in which he rejects the sunglasses is really good.  In a way this could have undermined the effect of the film but it is managed well and doesn't.\n\nThe cast is roundly good.  The exit of Sarah Connor is handled well and her replacement (Danes) is good despite a few duff lines which don't convince. Stahl's performance could be seen as mocking Furlong's drug problems (I can't see any other reason for his junkie-like tics etc.) but he is still good and carries the film well.  Schwarzenegger wisely agrees to mock his own character  the film takes the idea that time has passed the Terminator franchise by, by having the terminator itself being totally superseded. Loken is good as the T-X and is sexy enough but isn't given as much to do as anyone else.  Whereas Patrick was pretty much the main focus of T2 (because of the effects) Loken has less of an impact.\n\nOverall I had my doubts about this film but it did manage to do just what I needed it to do.  The action is overblown and enjoyable without being the cutting edge in special effects at any time.  The plot-driving scenes are good and the main story (behind the action) is involving and interesting, right up till the downbeat ending.  I must say that, although it is hardly the most imaginative or inspiring film made this year, it certainly does what you need a blockbuster to do  no deep, pretentious plots, no joy-less acting, but rather a big noisy movie that doesn't take itself too serious (despite the serious plot) and is actually very enjoyable to watch.

Since the 70's, three of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. These three movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that Gladiator director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.\n\nFor whatever reason, I don't remember hearing much about the civil war in Somalia or about the Battle of Mogadishu on which Black Hawk Down is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely FUBAR as two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Things went from bad to worse, as the Rangers found themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal was to shoot any American soldier that invaded their space. After "stirring up the hornet's nest", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the Rangers motto, "Leave No Man Behind".\n\nNeedless to say, Ridley Scott has made the ultimate war movie with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that temper the battle with slower character-building sequences, you have to wait only thirty minutes for the Rangers' mission to go into effect. And the action doesn't stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed. The fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening, at times, and it becomes almost too easy to become desensitized to the violence. By the third time someone yells "RPG's!" though, the entire audience knows to duck and cover their ears.\n\nWhile the American soldiers go in with a solid plan, it doesn't take long for panic to set in, and pretty soon, you're not sure which side is more disorganized. It's amazing to watch what seems like thousands of extras playing the Somali militia swarming over the soldiers, and the action and camerawork is reminiscent of a video game as the soldiers try to escape their precarious situation through the streets of Mogadishu. As the movie progresses, the tension continues to build as the grim and unrelenting hopelessness of the situation sets in both for the soldiers and the viewer.\n\nIt's pretty amazing how much has been made of the 19 downed American soldiers when over 1000 Somali men, women, and children were killed during the raid. While the movie is clearly weighed towards the American perspective, I can't imagine how it must have felt to be the guy who gets to play "Dead Somali with a Gun #354".\n\nAlthough characterization has always been used extensively in war movies to get the viewer to care about the characters, Black Hawk Down works better because, for the most part, the soldiers are personified as little more than grunts in the field doing the bidding of their superiors. At least the soldiers had their names taped to their helmets, so that this didn't have the problem of some war movies, where it's sometimes hard to tell who is who. Some of the best performances of the film come from Tom Sizemore as the gung-ho Lt.

Since the 70's, three of them have formed a bit of a holy trinity: Francis Ford Coppola's Apocalypse Now, Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, and Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. These three movies have set the bar for all other war movies that have come along since then. When it was announced that Gladiator director, Ridley Scott, would be adapting Mark Bowden's book, Black Hawk Down: A Story of Modern War, filmgoers knew that they would be in for a treat.\n\nFor whatever reason, I don't remember hearing much about the civil war in Somalia or about the Battle of Mogadishu on which Black Hawk Down is based. The plan seemed simple enough: the Army is sent into Somalia by the government to try to put an end to the Civil War. On October 3, 1993, a group of them were sent on a quick mission to capture the Somali warlord that had been running the country with an iron fist. It didn't take long for the operation to go completely FUBAR as two Black Hawk helicopters were shot down. Things went from bad to worse, as the Rangers found themselves surrounded by thousands of armed Somalis, whose only goal was to shoot any American soldier that invaded their space. After "stirring up the hornet's nest", the mission becomes a desperate attempt to maintain the Rangers motto, "Leave No Man Behind".\n\nNeedless to say, Ridley Scott has made the ultimate war movie with Black Hawk Down. Unlike some war films that temper the battle with slower character-building sequences, you have to wait only thirty minutes for the Rangers' mission to go into effect. And the action doesn't stop for the next two hours, as the rest of the movie is filled with flying bullets, explosions and bloodshed. The fighting is so chaotic that it is hard to follow the action and tell what is happening, at times, and it becomes almost too easy to become desensitized to the violence. By the third time someone yells "RPG's!" though, the entire audience knows to duck and cover their ears.\n\nWhile the American soldiers go in with a solid plan, it doesn't take long for panic to set in, and pretty soon, you're not sure which side is more disorganized. It's amazing to watch what seems like thousands of extras playing the Somali militia swarming over the soldiers, and the action and camerawork is reminiscent of a video game as the soldiers try to escape their precarious situation through the streets of Mogadishu. As the movie progresses, the tension continues to build as the grim and unrelenting hopelessness of the situation sets in both for the soldiers and the viewer.\n\nIt's pretty amazing how much has been made of the 19 downed American soldiers when over 1000 Somali men, women, and children were killed during the raid. While the movie is clearly weighed towards the American perspective, I can't imagine how it must have felt to be the guy who gets to play "Dead Somali with a Gun #354".\n\nAlthough characterization has always been used extensively in war movies to get the viewer to care about the characters, Black Hawk Down works better because, for the most part, the soldiers are personified as little more than grunts in the field doing the bidding of their superiors. At least the soldiers had their names taped to their helmets, so that this didn't have the problem of some war movies, where it's sometimes hard to tell who is who. Some of the best performances of the film come from Tom Sizemore as the gung-ho Lt. McKnight and Josh Hartnett, who plays the sergeant who leads the mission and feels personal guilt every time a man is lost. Sam Shepard also is excellent as Major General William Garrison, who sits back in the safe zone watching his doomed men be overpowered by the enemy. Eric Bana's part is small, but he has some of the best lines in the film, really driving home the point of why soldiers do what they do. Ewan McGregor's role is even more minor and insignificant, but his Trainspotting compatriot, Ewen Bremner offers the movie's little bit of comic relief.\n\nAs expected in a Ridley Scott film, the visuals and camerawork are stunning with the movie having a gray almost monochromatic look that makes the orange flames and red blood really stand out.

I have seen a few guest characters that would work better and create good relationships and open more story lines... this character ain't one of them...I find myself forwarding her scenes to avoid the irritation her character brings...I have only found myself being irritated by one other character during the shows seasons and that is the Coast Guard Agent Borin she was terrible...so OTT at trying to be something she clearly couldn't be .... like some sort of female Gibbs character... she was really irritating both as a character and as the actress trying to play that role ... maybe a different actress would have made that work but certainly not Diane Neal...\n\nI hope the makers of the show do change this new character..I can see myself drifting away from this show if they don't...\n\nBut then maybe the other side of the coin is that the show is not putting out the same level of episodes and story lines that it used to... and my dislike of that new character is more about the overall than just the that..?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130580,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-09-23","keywords":"goth girl,babe scientist,special agent,naval criminal investigative service,police procedural","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001319/","name":"Mark Harmon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564724/","name":"David McCallum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0615266/","name":"Sean Murray"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0114905/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0066107/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183875/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069074/","name":"Donald P.

Whether throwaway crap like "The Scorpion King" or just plain embarrassing stuff like "The Tooth Fairy" (we get it Dwayne, you can laugh at yourself - how about getting down to business!), I just never felt compelled to see one of his movies. Until now.\n\nI could tell from the trailer this one was going to be different.\n\nFaster is a throwback to the merciless action flicks of the 1970s. Existential in tone. Ruthless in execution. It's kind of a cross between Death Wish and Vanishing Point. A pure, undiluted revenge drama that shows Dwayne Johnson really can walk the walk when he wants to. This isn't G-rated pabulum for the whole family. This is a leather glove across the chops, R-rated blast from the muzzle of a sawed-off shotgun. The plot isn't very complex, but the pacing is beautiful, as is the purity of this amazing movie.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton does a great job too as The Cop, a lowlife drug addicted, slimy little lawman with 9 days to go before retirement and one last case to solve. And Oliver Jackson-Cohen is terrific as a yuppie hit-man with a personal score to settle.\n\nIf you like movies that are intent simply in kicking your ass for 90 minutes, you could do a lot worse than Faster. After all these years, I'm finally a Dwayne Johnson fan.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104536,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-12-01","keywords":"suspense,vigilante,hitman,veteran cop,vigilante cop","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Faster: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4163606809","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5NzI3NDk3MzleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDAzMjA3MzMx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5NzI3NDk3MzleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDAzMjA3MzMx._V1_.jpg","description":"An ex-con sets out to avenge his brother's death after they were double-crossed during a heist years ago.

Whether throwaway crap like "The Scorpion King" or just plain embarrassing stuff like "The Tooth Fairy" (we get it Dwayne, you can laugh at yourself - how about getting down to business!), I just never felt compelled to see one of his movies. Until now.\n\nI could tell from the trailer this one was going to be different.\n\nFaster is a throwback to the merciless action flicks of the 1970s. Existential in tone. Ruthless in execution. It's kind of a cross between Death Wish and Vanishing Point. A pure, undiluted revenge drama that shows Dwayne Johnson really can walk the walk when he wants to. This isn't G-rated pabulum for the whole family. This is a leather glove across the chops, R-rated blast from the muzzle of a sawed-off shotgun. The plot isn't very complex, but the pacing is beautiful, as is the purity of this amazing movie.\n\nBilly Bob Thornton does a great job too as The Cop, a lowlife drug addicted, slimy little lawman with 9 days to go before retirement and one last case to solve. And Oliver Jackson-Cohen is terrific as a yuppie hit-man with a personal score to settle.\n\nIf you like movies that are intent simply in kicking your ass for 90 minutes, you could do a lot worse than Faster. After all these years, I'm finally a Dwayne Johnson fan.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104536,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-12-01","keywords":"suspense,vigilante,hitman,veteran cop,vigilante cop","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Faster: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4163606809","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5NzI3NDk3MzleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDAzMjA3MzMx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA5NzI3NDk3MzleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDAzMjA3MzMx._V1_.jpg","description":"An ex-con sets out to avenge his brother's death after they were double-crossed during a heist years ago.

The same cast is there with some interesting additions but the focus has to some extent, switched to the Nazi "treasure" that may or may not be in the vicinity. There are flashbacks that explain the presence of the newcomers but it is not always clear which time zone we are in and the editing is so bizarre that occasionally the storyline becomes incomprehensible.

Despite looking so, this series is not extinct just yet.","reviewBody":"I think Resident Evil: Extinction elevates itself slightly higher than its two predecessors and slightly higher than I thought it would in general. On one hand, it is a series of bizarre and somewhat illogical events that transpire under the scenario of an apocalyptic event's aftermath but on the other, it is a pastiche of 'zombie' films gone by; a crude study of one man's obsession with his research and a somewhat guilty action film. I liked Resident Evil: Extinction a little more than others of its type because it gives us more of a sedate look at the situation rather than a mere exploitation of special effects, attractive heroines and needless gore. Yes, it's true to say that this film has action scenes of a silly nature but they do not seem as stupid as previous Resident Evil films in which the protagonist is able to use kung-fu on dogs and make impossible shots to defeat her foes.\n\nThe action scenes here are paced better and do not rely on the mere visualisation of actually seeing a Licker monster or Nemeses himself as the reason to keep watching. The enemies here are unspectacular and familiar and all the better for it; we get the feeling this is more of a survival film about the beasts and beings that would actually be out there rather than dumb scenes that try to impress us with a mentality: "Look, a Licker." or "Look, this is what Nemeses would look like in reality.". In the film, there is a scene in which several zombies come charging out of a metal crate. The scene works on the level of realism within the film because the film could so easily have substituted them for a larger, more visually impressive enemy that would've sufficed for the following action scene.\n\nI mentioned the word 'realism' in that paragraph, perhaps crazily so. But Resident Evil: Extinction takes time to present its heroes, all of whom travel in a procession of large vehicles, with every day issues that would affect them. Things like 'how much fuel is left? Where is the nearest petrol station?'; 'Where is the next meal coming from?' and 'How can we bed down for the night safely and free from attack?' These sorts of questions were lost in the previous films and are empty from other recent post-apocalyptic horror/sci-fi films like Blade: Trinity. Additionally, when the film does reveal its particularly large scale monster for the film's climax it does so in an effective manner. This is because we have had the monster and the source for the monster presented to us on another plot line. We get a feeling that it may happen within the world of the film unlike when Nemeses popped up in the last film merely because he's had the injection and must now just keep destroying stuff until he meets the hero for the finale fight.\n\nAlthough it takes on the matter of the pacing and the clarity of the action scenes, Resident Evil: Extinction is still guilty of one or two things. The film actually begins in a manner than had me dreading it would be as bad as the previous two. Alice (Jovovich) meets some human survivors but discovers them oddly unfriendly which acts more of a surprise than a dramatic twist. It's a scene in which implied prior victims have been conned, raped and then fed to the dogs; in this case infected dogs and sure enough Alice finds herself in the said situation  a sequence of events that plays out in a daft manner that reminds you of the prior films. It had me thinking 'how do the renegade survivors lock the infected dogs up for next time once they've had their fun?' Then there was the rather careless scene in which Alice falls asleep in the middle of the desert, at night and with the fire still burning  not smart considering the situation. The film is also disappointing in the sense that when the procession of vehicles housing the characters Alice, they are spread evenly in ethnicity and attitude meaning each individual 'type' could be killed off accordingly.\n\nBut for the best part, Resident Evil: Extinction is a surprisingly enjoyable film with an interesting set-up and I was really quite fond of the story running parallel involving Dr. Isaacs (Glen) and his research in developing the un-dead, albeit a clear reference to Dr. Logan in Day of the Dead. This plot line runs alongside the development of the convoy and the situations they must deal with, the thing I like here is that these people are not world savers; they will not go on a cause and effect fuelled story and make all the un-dead disappear, they are just there to survive and through Alice their goal is to make it to the icy regions of Alaska.\n\nThe bizarre thing about this latest Resident Evil instalment is just how good it might've been had it cut the action scenes down a little and tidied up the opening twenty or so minutes. It is disappointing that the convoy is made up of a Redneck (who's naturally good at sniping); an Aussie; two African-Americans; a Mexican and a wise-talking white American, all of whom exist for zombie fodder at the end of the day but this film instils me with hope that perhaps the films can be as good as the games  in the games, ammunition was a very sacred thing and the tactic of running from enemies rather than shooting them was a good one. In the films, the producers are gradually realising this and the next film may well surprise a few people in terms of how watchable it actually is.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":189198,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2007-11-07","keywords":"desert,satellite,convoy,crow,clone","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Resident Evil: Extinction","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3364028697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmM0YjkxZmQtNTVjNi00YmNmLTg3NDAtZWZhZWQ4YWJiOGUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmM0YjkxZmQtNTVjNi00YmNmLTg3NDAtZWZhZWQ4YWJiOGUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Behind the scene: Fighting Zombies"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000170/","name":"Milla Jovovich"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005123/","name":"Ali Larter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004912/","name":"Oded Fehr"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0611683/","name":"Russell Mulcahy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0032081/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0027271/","name":"Paul W.S.

I wasn't overly impressed with the younger cast but thought maybe they would take a different aspect on the film. I was also keen on how Dr. Doom would be portrayed and how he would influence the film as a villain. \n\nI couldn't be more wrong. \n\n-There was limited character back-story on the Fan 4 -There was no middle just a five minute climax at the end that was hardly gripping -The cringe-worthy quotes towards the end of the film were just punishing to watch -Dr. Doom looks like a Droid and goes completely insane over a minor issue and the movie doesn't quite explain why -Dr. Doom is also meant to be one of the most O.P characters in the comics but yet he seems to drop down to the levels of the Fan 4 in the final battle which previously you saw him destroy anything in his path previously. -Whats the go with Tim Nelson being in this movie seriously can they stop regurgitating actors from previously failed ' marvel ' movies and maybe have a fresh start for some characters, especially for someone with a mediocre role as he had -Not really a huge issue but very disappointingly no after credits scenes which are signature to marvel based moves ( even though it is owned by FOX ) \n\nThe only reason I have given it a 3 is the visual effects, only for one character though. The Thing looked insane compared to the 2005 version, only problem was due to the short length of the movie he got limited time and whipped out some really punishing quotes towards the end of the movie. Also I did like Franklin Storm in this film, he was a breathe of fresh air...but again wasn't perfected pulling out some pretty cheesy lines.\n\nSo overall it was a total dud, no background characterisation on the characters, if there was it was limited and to go along with the short running time, it was hard to watch.

I wasn't overly impressed with the younger cast but thought maybe they would take a different aspect on the film. I was also keen on how Dr. Doom would be portrayed and how he would influence the film as a villain. \n\nI couldn't be more wrong. \n\n-There was limited character back-story on the Fan 4 -There was no middle just a five minute climax at the end that was hardly gripping -The cringe-worthy quotes towards the end of the film were just punishing to watch -Dr. Doom looks like a Droid and goes completely insane over a minor issue and the movie doesn't quite explain why -Dr. Doom is also meant to be one of the most O.P characters in the comics but yet he seems to drop down to the levels of the Fan 4 in the final battle which previously you saw him destroy anything in his path previously. -Whats the go with Tim Nelson being in this movie seriously can they stop regurgitating actors from previously failed ' marvel ' movies and maybe have a fresh start for some characters, especially for someone with a mediocre role as he had -Not really a huge issue but very disappointingly no after credits scenes which are signature to marvel based moves ( even though it is owned by FOX ) \n\nThe only reason I have given it a 3 is the visual effects, only for one character though. The Thing looked insane compared to the 2005 version, only problem was due to the short length of the movie he got limited time and whipped out some really punishing quotes towards the end of the movie. Also I did like Franklin Storm in this film, he was a breathe of fresh air...but again wasn't perfected pulling out some pretty cheesy lines.\n\nSo overall it was a total dud, no background characterisation on the characters, if there was it was limited and to go along with the short running time, it was hard to watch. Dialogue was just really, really average and I spent a lot of time watching the movie with my hands on my head in agony.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

I have not read the novel (even though I plan to do it now) so I'm only offering my views on the movie.\n\nFirst of all: It's amazingly beautiful. The costumes and sets are gorgeous, the cinematography is exquisite, the animals are cute (especially Rosie the elephant) and the three leads are very easy on the eyes as well. \n\nRobert Pattinson was actually quite good. This was a surprise to me, since I didn't really think he was anything special in any of the Twilight movies or "Remember Me". He looked very appropriate for the time the movie was set in, and even though I love Emile Hirsch (who auditioned for Jacob too) I'm confident that Robert was the best choice there was for this role, it was perfect for him. Hal Holbrook was also very fitting for the role of older Jacob. The two actors really made me believe that they were the same person in different stages of his life.\n\nReese Witherspoon was okay. She looked beautiful, was charming and cute but it felt like something was missing - however, I can't think of any other actress I would have liked better in the role, so I came to the conclusion that it was probably the character Marlena that was a little bland, not Reese. \n\nBut the true star of this movie was Christoph Waltz. I may be a bit biased since I loved him in "Inglorious Basterds", but he was even more perfect in this movie. His portrayal of August was amazing, he made him likable and interesting and I was always compelled by his scenes. The character reminded me a lot of Miles in "King Kong" (played by Jack Black), a character that also wanted fame and success more than anything and used questionable and even cruel methods to get it. He was terrifying in some scenes too, but always believable. Also, in the beginning of the movie i really felt the chemistry between August and Marlena, which made the character even more interesting; however, I did feel like Jacob and Marlena had chemistry too, and in my opinion this way it was more realistic (both men loved her and she also cared about both of them). \n\nI loved the movie, and I really recommend it to everyone. I would sincerely give it 10/10 stars. Of course there was some parts of the movie I didn't like (particularly towards the end of it), but overall it was a magical, spectacular and epic period movie, and I can't wait to see it again!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113964,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-04-22","keywords":"animal abuse,circus,elephant,ringmaster,train","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2: Water for Elephants","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1397594649","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MzA4MjYxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc1NTYzNTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MzA4MjYxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc1NTYzNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A veterinary student (Robert Pattinson) abandons his studies after his parents are killed and joins a traveling circus as their vet, where he meets animal trainer August (Christoph Waltz) and his wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon)."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000702/","name":"Reese Witherspoon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910607/","name":"Christoph Waltz"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1349376/","name":"Francis Lawrence"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177280/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0481418/","name":"Richard LaGravenese"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2717485/","name":"Sara Gruen"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His portrayal of August was amazing, he made him likable and interesting and I was always compelled by his scenes. The character reminded me a lot of Miles in "King Kong" (played by Jack Black), a character that also wanted fame and success more than anything and used questionable and even cruel methods to get it. He was terrifying in some scenes too, but always believable. Also, in the beginning of the movie i really felt the chemistry between August and Marlena, which made the character even more interesting; however, I did feel like Jacob and Marlena had chemistry too, and in my opinion this way it was more realistic (both men loved her and she also cared about both of them). \n\nI loved the movie, and I really recommend it to everyone. I would sincerely give it 10/10 stars. Of course there was some parts of the movie I didn't like (particularly towards the end of it), but overall it was a magical, spectacular and epic period movie, and I can't wait to see it again!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":113964,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2011-04-22","keywords":"animal abuse,circus,elephant,ringmaster,train","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2: Water for Elephants","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1397594649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MzA4MjYxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc1NTYzNTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA0MzA4MjYxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzc1NTYzNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A veterinary student (Robert Pattinson) abandons his studies after his parents are killed and joins a traveling circus as their vet, where he meets animal trainer August (Christoph Waltz) and his wife Marlena (Reese Witherspoon).","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000702/","name":"Reese Witherspoon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910607/","name":"Christoph Waltz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1349376/","name":"Francis Lawrence"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0070636/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177280/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0481418/","name":"Richard LaGravenese","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2717485/","name":"Sara Gruen"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Surprising, right?","reviewBody":"Written by Richard Salvatore and directed by George Gallo, this film noir features an incredibly talented cast: John Travolta, Morgan Freeman, Brendan Fraser, Famke Janssen, Peter Stormare, and Robert Patrick. Surprisingly, this is the first movie that John Travolta and Morgan Freeman have ever been in together. With that much star power, this movie should have been excellent. Unfortunately, it's not.\n\nThe Good: It's a pleasure watching John Travolta and Morgan Freeman, even in bad movies. I was shocked when I first saw Brendan Frasier on the screen. I hadn't seen pictures of his recent weight gain and wondered if he did it intentionally for this film. He didn't but I thought his acting was outstanding in his role as the doctor. I've always been a fan.\n\nI like Famke Janssen and thought she played a southern belle well. She looked like she had some new cheek implants done recently. Why do beautiful women in Hollywood mess up their original beauty?\n\nIt was great to see Ella Bleu Travolta star with her father in a movie. I felt bad that the script mostly had her crying during the entire movie. She was also in the movie Old Dogs with her dad.

Surprising, right?","reviewBody":"Written by Richard Salvatore and directed by George Gallo, this film noir features an incredibly talented cast: John Travolta, Morgan Freeman, Brendan Fraser, Famke Janssen, Peter Stormare, and Robert Patrick. Surprisingly, this is the first movie that John Travolta and Morgan Freeman have ever been in together. With that much star power, this movie should have been excellent. Unfortunately, it's not.\n\nThe Good: It's a pleasure watching John Travolta and Morgan Freeman, even in bad movies. I was shocked when I first saw Brendan Frasier on the screen. I hadn't seen pictures of his recent weight gain and wondered if he did it intentionally for this film. He didn't but I thought his acting was outstanding in his role as the doctor. I've always been a fan.\n\nI like Famke Janssen and thought she played a southern belle well. She looked like she had some new cheek implants done recently. Why do beautiful women in Hollywood mess up their original beauty?\n\nIt was great to see Ella Bleu Travolta star with her father in a movie. I felt bad that the script mostly had her crying during the entire movie. She was also in the movie Old Dogs with her dad. She is one of those rare teenagers who actually likes her parents and isn't embarrassed by them.\n\nThe music sounded like it came from a 1970's drama and set the right tone from the very beginning.\n\nSome have criticized the Texas drawl that the actors tried to master but I thought everyone sounded fine.\n\nThe Bad: You can almost guess what happens by just watching the trailer.

Producer of numerous Wajda's films including KATYN, Michal Kwiecinski in a witty directorial venture, EXTRAS, explores how modern men think of surrendering to Chinese Wave and drowning in its vast sea, when there's nothing left in his homeland, but a wasteland!

Here goes: John J McLaughlin wrote this "Hitchcock" screenplay based on Stephen Rebello's book "Alfred Hitchcock and the Making of Psycho", which was based on the filming of the Psycho screenplay from Joseph Stefano, which was loosely based on Robert Bloch's book, which was based on the real life crimes of Ed Gein. Whew! \n\nIt's kind of interesting that Alfred Hitchcock is hot again. His Vertigo recently displaced Citizen Kane as the all-time greatest film. HBO is still running their recent production of "The Girl", which is based on Hitchcock's making of "The Birds" and his unhealthy connection to Tippi Hedren. And now, we get this Hollywood production, supposedly based on the master of suspense. I saw supposedly, because this film plays like it was written by the heirs of Alma Reville, Hitch's long time wife and collaborator. We all knew she worked on his films and contributed ideas, but the film wants you to believe she was the real genius behind the public genius.\n\nThe movie is entitled "Hitchcock" and is based on the making of "Psycho", but in fact, it's more the story of Alma and her husband. While there is nothing wrong with that story ... in fact, it is quite interesting and entertaining ... it's just kind of false advertising.\n\nHelen Mirren portrays Alma, and instead of the mousy woman who usually faded into the background, we see a fairly strong and talented woman who goes toe-to-toe with Hitch in her best scene. Sir Anthony Hopkins dons some facial appliances and a fat suit and does a solid job of capturing the odd, creepy, leering, disturbed, insecure genius we recognize as Alfred Hitchcock. He comes across as louder and more in-motion than what we have previously seen. And while director Sacha Gervasi makes it clear that Hitch is not a "normal" guy, he doesn't dwell too much on the blond fixations.\n\nThe emphasis on the skills and importance of Alma would be fine were it not so exaggerated. Surely every great director and writer and artist has a muse and/or support system; and, there is no question Alma was a very talented lady, but her strength here bordered on distracting to the overall picture. Especially needless was the storyline of Alma being attracted to screenwriter Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston), who wrote "Strangers on a Train" for Hitchcock.\n\nThe Hitchcock humor is allowed to shine through and his battles with Paramount Studio head Barney Balaban (Richard Portnow) and the censorship board (Kurtwood Smith) are excellent. Hopkins finds the humanity under the fat suit and is especially good in his work with Scarlett Johansson (as Janet Leigh) and Jessica Biel (as Vera Miles). I also got a kick out of James D'Arcy as the affected Anthony Perkins and all his quirky mannerisms.\n\nThough this barely qualifies as a story on the making of Psycho, it was chilling to watch the addition of Bernard Herrmann's iconic score added to the shower scene. In fact, Danny Elfman does a nice job of subtly adding a Herrmann-type score to this film. I'm not sure if the film will play well with real Hitchcock aficionados, but if you can forgive the Alma slant, it's actually quite interesting and entertaining and kind of a sweet film at its core.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2012-12-14","keywords":"year 1959,1950s,los angeles california,studio executive,censorship board","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2501551129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTgzODM1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzOTk1OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTgzODM1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzOTk1OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A love story between influential filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock and wife Alma Reville during the filming of Psycho in 1959."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000545/","name":"Helen Mirren"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424060/","name":"Scarlett Johansson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0315065/","name":"Sacha Gervasi"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199880/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0118469/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572352/","name":"John J.

I'm not sure if the film will play well with real Hitchcock aficionados, but if you can forgive the Alma slant, it's actually quite interesting and entertaining and kind of a sweet film at its core.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2012-12-14","keywords":"year 1959,1950s,los angeles california,studio executive,censorship board","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2501551129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTgzODM1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzOTk1OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1MTgzODM1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODEzOTk1OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A love story between influential filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock and wife Alma Reville during the filming of Psycho in 1959.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000164/","name":"Anthony Hopkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000545/","name":"Helen Mirren","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424060/","name":"Scarlett Johansson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0315065/","name":"Sacha Gervasi"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0199880/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0118469/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0572352/","name":"John J.

    <desc lang="pl">Zieja: Directed by Robert Glinski. With Andrzej Seweryn, Mateusz Wieclawek, Zbigniew Zamachowski, Slawomir Orzechowski. The 70s. A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed. The film "Zieja" is rooted in the movement of Polish Catholicism, which is based on high ethical standards, poverty and tolerance, as well as respect and love for other human beings." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt10136434/","name":"Zieja","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMDNiZDctYjg3OS00OTU2LWE2ZGMtZThjZmM0YmI3NjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwMTY3NDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The 70s.

Getting told that the local Odeon were doing a one-off screening of a interesting-sounding Polish Drama later that day,I got set to meet Zieja.\n\nNote:Some spoilers in review.\n\nView on the film:\n\nOn opposing sides not only round the table, but also morally, Andrzej Seweryn and Zbigniew Zamachowski set the screen ablaze in Zieja and Grosicki's interrogation sequences, thanks to the stamping of feet frustration Zamachowski gives Grosicki being counted in this psychological duel with a upright, quiet confidence Seweryn has beaming from every word of Zieja.\n\nA important figure sadly not that well known outside of Poland, the screenplay by Wojciech Lepianka spans a impressively compact bio-pic on Jan Zieja, going right back in flashbacks to Zieja's involvement in the Warsaw Uprising,to the 70's,where Zieja's liberal liturgical catches the attention of the Communists secret services.\n\nBased around the interrogation with Zieja and Grosicki, Lepianka's consistent move to flashbacks gives what should be the centrepiece of the title a stop-start atmosphere, where just as tensions are starting to build, Lepianka steps back and enters a flashback.\n\nRolling up the opening sequence to Grosicki being a slob in bed, director Robert Glinski &amp; cinematographer Witold Plociennik firmly place Zieja on the other side with graceful close-ups and splintered shadows casting a spiritual aura on Zieja.\n\nClosely working with editor Ewa Smal, Glinski stylishly links Zieja's experience at the interrogation table with the horrors he's faced in life,via pristine match-cuts linking the flashbacks and the present into each other,along with eye-catch screen-wipes performed by Zieja walking across the screen to deliver a sermon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":85,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-08-28","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0786614/","name":"Andrzej Seweryn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5851110/","name":"Mateusz Wieclawek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0952498/","name":"Zbigniew Zamachowski"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322894/","name":"Robert Glinski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0087308/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0185099/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0503287/","name":"Wojciech Lepianka"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 10136434, Title: Zieja, 
 --- Description: Zieja: Directed by Robert Glinski. With Andrzej Seweryn, Mateusz Wieclawek, Zbigniew Zamachowski, Slawomir Orzechowski. The 70s. A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed. The film "Zieja" is rooted in the movement of Polish Catholicism, which is based on high ethical standards, poverty and tolerance, as well as respect and love for other human beings." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt10136434/","name":"Zieja","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMDNiZDctYjg3OS00OTU2LWE2ZGMtZThjZmM0YmI3NjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwMTY3NDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The 70s.

Getting told that the local Odeon were doing a one-off screening of a interesting-sounding Polish Drama later that day,I got set to meet Zieja.\n\nNote:Some spoilers in review.\n\nView on the film:\n\nOn opposing sides not only round the table, but also morally, Andrzej Seweryn and Zbigniew Zamachowski set the screen ablaze in Zieja and Grosicki's interrogation sequences, thanks to the stamping of feet frustration Zamachowski gives Grosicki being counted in this psychological duel with a upright, quiet confidence Seweryn has beaming from every word of Zieja.\n\nA important figure sadly not that well known outside of Poland, the screenplay by Wojciech Lepianka spans a impressively compact bio-pic on Jan Zieja, going right back in flashbacks to Zieja's involvement in the Warsaw Uprising,to the 70's,where Zieja's liberal liturgical catches the attention of the Communists secret services.\n\nBased around the interrogation with Zieja and Grosicki, Lepianka's consistent move to flashbacks gives what should be the centrepiece of the title a stop-start atmosphere, where just as tensions are starting to build, Lepianka steps back and enters a flashback.\n\nRolling up the opening sequence to Grosicki being a slob in bed, director Robert Glinski &amp; cinematographer Witold Plociennik firmly place Zieja on the other side with graceful close-ups and splintered shadows casting a spiritual aura on Zieja.\n\nClosely working with editor Ewa Smal, Glinski stylishly links Zieja's experience at the interrogation table with the horrors he's faced in life,via pristine match-cuts linking the flashbacks and the present into each other,along with eye-catch screen-wipes performed by Zieja walking across the screen to deliver a sermon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":85,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-08-28","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0786614/","name":"Andrzej Seweryn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5851110/","name":"Mateusz Wieclawek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0952498/","name":"Zbigniew Zamachowski"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322894/","name":"Robert Glinski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0087308/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0185099/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0503287/","name":"Wojciech Lepianka"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="pl">A Love Yarn</title>
    <desc lang="pl">A Love Yarn: Directed by Peter Burger. With Anna Hutchison, Simon Arblaster, Olivia Tennet, Annie Whittle. The owner of a quaint New Zealand yarn shop, Sophie Markham, gets her world flipped upside down after learning her top supplier of yarn, King Farms, is stopping production. Much to her surprise, the charming yet stuck-in-his-ways Samuel King has traveled all the way from New York to audit the business model of the farm. Desperate to keep her shop going, Sophie convinces Samuel to give her two weeks to learn the ropes of yarn spinning and raise enough money to buy the mill herself.

Other characters play their parts as though they were visitors in the set.\n\nThere were two or three instances where I was tricked into thinking that something exciting was going to happen, but the subject ended abruptly and the boring and easily anticipated theme was back.\n\nI wanted to like the movie so badly that I was successful in staying awake for about 45 minutes, but then was in and out until the last 20 minutes, where the pace picked up from snail to turtle pace.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":128416,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2014-02-26","keywords":"art,art expert,nazi stolen art,1940s,world war two","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1176348697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzcyOTExNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAzMzcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzcyOTExNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDAzMzcyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a race against time, a crew of art historians and museum curators unite to recover renowned works of art stolen by Nazis before Hitler destroys them.

Or the original – "HK Deserters".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":491,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5,"genre":["Action","Comedy","War"],"datePublished":"1998-12-04","keywords":"1940s,world war two","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464945/","name":"Marek Kondrat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0511277/","name":"Boguslaw Linda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0953975/","name":"Wiktor Zborowski"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0538105/","name":"Janusz Majewski"],"creator":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0538105/","name":"Janusz Majewski"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Out of all of them, earlier today I believe I shave seen my favorite. Not War Horse, Sherlock Holmes, Tintin, Mission Impossible, or Alvin and the Chipmunks. The winner is We Bought a Zoo. Now to be fair, I haven't seen Mission Impossible 4, but despite all the great things I've heard about it, I don't think it will strike a chord with me like We Bought a Zoo did. It is such an inspirational story with a powerful message. And it gets quite emotional in several spots. Now I'm not an emotional person typically and I've never actually cried in a movie, but this movie almost broke me. My mom, who cries a lot during movies, certainly was crying in a few spots, so its a tearjerker.\n\nWe Bought a Zoo is based on a true story. Specifically the memoir of Benjamin Mee, which is his story of, as you can guess, him buying a Zoo. There are some noticeable differences in the movie and in the real life story as I have looked at it afterwards, but those changes were adapted only after the approval of Benjamin Mee himself, who still owns and lives in the Zoo he purchased. In the movie, Benjamin, played by Matt Damon, is going through some serious family troubles. Namely, his wife the he dearly loved has just recently passed away which has made life for his young family really difficult emotionally, especially for him and his teenage son. Seeking to get away from life a bit, he decides that he wants to move and falls in love with a certain country house some 9 miles outside town. Before purchasing it, he quickly learns that it is a somewhat broken down and struggling Zoo. Despite his background as an adventurous person, he has no knowledge of Zoology. However, he decides to take on the task to help renovate and re-open the struggling Zoo. With that said, yes it is a story about a Zoo, but telling a story of how a man renovated a Zoo is not the point of this movie. It is a story of courage. A story about moving forward in life despite the difficult times. Lastly it's a story about maintaining good relationships with your family and those around you. There are a few taglines in the movie that really just jumped out at me that I will remember and use in my own personal life to help me.\n\nNow We Bought a Zoo isn't without its flaws. There are times when I was slightly bored with it and times where it seemed to move slow. I wasn't a big fan of some of the acting by several of the more minor characters. But overall it was a very well done film. The strongest part of the movie was certainly Matt Damon. He has become one of my favorite actors recently and in this he gives a very good performance. If the Academy Awards were up to me, I would give him the Oscar for best Actor after this performance. I hope he at least gets nominated because he deserves it. The cast around him was also superb for the most part. Scarlett Johansson did a great job in the lead female performance, that being Kelly the lead Zookeeper. Elle Fanning did a great job acting as one of the younger crew members of the Zoo. Lastly, Benjamin's two kids ages 14 and 7, were done quite well. His 14 year old son Dylan, played by Colin Ford, even looked and acted like a young Matt Damon. The score in this movie was absolutely beautiful. It really made the movie. In my opinion it is one of the best scores of the year. The cinematography was also great. I especially loved the animal shots in the movie.\n\nIn conclusion, We Bought a Zoo is no action-packed, high suspense adventure movie. If you are looking for that, go check out Mission Impossible or Sherlock Holmes. What it is is an inspirational family movie that I really enjoyed. I highly recommend you check it out. I give it an 8 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-12-23","keywords":"based on true story,zoo,inspection,2010s,family relationships","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi592747545","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A father moves his young family to the countryside to renovate and re-open a struggling zoo.

I give it an 8 out of 10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139374,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-12-23","keywords":"based on true story,zoo,inspection,2010s,family relationships","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi592747545","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM2NzI1NDc2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTgwMDg2Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A father moves his young family to the countryside to renovate and re-open a struggling zoo.

The negative reviews are unrealistic, this is a good insight into what happened. 8/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4330,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-06-14","keywords":"poisoning,salisbury wiltshire,year 2018,nerve agent,british police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1245863/","name":"Rafe Spall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240359/","name":"Anne-Marie Duff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8982365/","name":"Judah Cousin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0645108/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2779562265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNlNGI3NzMtZDRkMC00MjdkLTgwYTUtY2ViZDcwYjJlMDJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNlNGI3NzMtZDRkMC00MjdkLTgwYTUtY2ViZDcwYjJlMDJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In March 2018, the eyes of the world turned to the British city of Salisbury when it became the epicenter of what has been described as one of the biggest political events of the 21st century -- but until now, the heroic acts behind the headlines have not been told. Within three days of the assassination attempt on double agent and spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, key agencies discovered that a lethal nerve agent called Novichok was used, just half a teaspoon of which could kill 20,000 people. Within four days, hundreds of traces were found across the city, and, just when things were finally thought to be under control, a perfume bottle containing the nerve agent was discovered, throwing the investigation into renewed chaos."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="pl">Czy na pewno umiesz gotować?</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Mistrzowie domowej kuchni poznają prawdę o swoim kulinarnym talencie. Bohaterem każdego odcinka jest osoba zgłoszona przez rodzinę. Każdy myśli, że został wybrany ze względu na swoje zdolności. Tymczasem okazuje się, że bliscy mają już dość przesolonej lasagne, mdłej pomidorówki lub twardych schabowych, ale boją się powiedzieć to wprost kucharzowi amatorowi. Znany szef kuchni Andrzej Polan ocenia umiejętności swoich gości i pomaga im podszkolić się w trudnej sztuce gotowania.</desc>

I wasn't overly impressed with the younger cast but thought maybe they would take a different aspect on the film. I was also keen on how Dr. Doom would be portrayed and how he would influence the film as a villain. \n\nI couldn't be more wrong. \n\n-There was limited character back-story on the Fan 4 -There was no middle just a five minute climax at the end that was hardly gripping -The cringe-worthy quotes towards the end of the film were just punishing to watch -Dr. Doom looks like a Droid and goes completely insane over a minor issue and the movie doesn't quite explain why -Dr. Doom is also meant to be one of the most O.P characters in the comics but yet he seems to drop down to the levels of the Fan 4 in the final battle which previously you saw him destroy anything in his path previously. -Whats the go with Tim Nelson being in this movie seriously can they stop regurgitating actors from previously failed ' marvel ' movies and maybe have a fresh start for some characters, especially for someone with a mediocre role as he had -Not really a huge issue but very disappointingly no after credits scenes which are signature to marvel based moves ( even though it is owned by FOX ) \n\nThe only reason I have given it a 3 is the visual effects, only for one character though. The Thing looked insane compared to the 2005 version, only problem was due to the short length of the movie he got limited time and whipped out some really punishing quotes towards the end of the movie. Also I did like Franklin Storm in this film, he was a breathe of fresh air...but again wasn't perfected pulling out some pretty cheesy lines.\n\nSo overall it was a total dud, no background characterisation on the characters, if there was it was limited and to go along with the short running time, it was hard to watch. Dialogue was just really, really average and I spent a lot of time watching the movie with my hands on my head in agony.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

I was also keen on how Dr. Doom would be portrayed and how he would influence the film as a villain. \n\nI couldn't be more wrong. \n\n-There was limited character back-story on the Fan 4 -There was no middle just a five minute climax at the end that was hardly gripping -The cringe-worthy quotes towards the end of the film were just punishing to watch -Dr. Doom looks like a Droid and goes completely insane over a minor issue and the movie doesn't quite explain why -Dr. Doom is also meant to be one of the most O.P characters in the comics but yet he seems to drop down to the levels of the Fan 4 in the final battle which previously you saw him destroy anything in his path previously. -Whats the go with Tim Nelson being in this movie seriously can they stop regurgitating actors from previously failed ' marvel ' movies and maybe have a fresh start for some characters, especially for someone with a mediocre role as he had -Not really a huge issue but very disappointingly no after credits scenes which are signature to marvel based moves ( even though it is owned by FOX ) \n\nThe only reason I have given it a 3 is the visual effects, only for one character though. The Thing looked insane compared to the 2005 version, only problem was due to the short length of the movie he got limited time and whipped out some really punishing quotes towards the end of the movie. Also I did like Franklin Storm in this film, he was a breathe of fresh air...but again wasn't perfected pulling out some pretty cheesy lines.\n\nSo overall it was a total dud, no background characterisation on the characters, if there was it was limited and to go along with the short running time, it was hard to watch. Dialogue was just really, really average and I spent a lot of time watching the movie with my hands on my head in agony.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

I have not read the novel (even though I plan to do it now) so I'm only offering my views on the movie.\n\nFirst of all: It's amazingly beautiful. The costumes and sets are gorgeous, the cinematography is exquisite, the animals are cute (especially Rosie the elephant) and the three leads are very easy on the eyes as well. \n\nRobert Pattinson was actually quite good. This was a surprise to me, since I didn't really think he was anything special in any of the Twilight movies or "Remember Me". He looked very appropriate for the time the movie was set in, and even though I love Emile Hirsch (who auditioned for Jacob too) I'm confident that Robert was the best choice there was for this role, it was perfect for him. Hal Holbrook was also very fitting for the role of older Jacob. The two actors really made me believe that they were the same person in different stages of his life.\n\nReese Witherspoon was okay. She looked beautiful, was charming and cute but it felt like something was missing - however, I can't think of any other actress I would have liked better in the role, so I came to the conclusion that it was probably the character Marlena that was a little bland, not Reese. \n\nBut the true star of this movie was Christoph Waltz. I may be a bit biased since I loved him in "Inglorious Basterds", but he was even more perfect in this movie. His portrayal of August was amazing, he made him likable and interesting and I was always compelled by his scenes. The character reminded me a lot of Miles in "King Kong" (played by Jack Black), a character that also wanted fame and success more than anything and used questionable and even cruel methods to get it. He was terrifying in some scenes too, but always believable. Also, in the beginning of the movie i really felt the chemistry between August and Marlena, which made the character even more interesting; however, I did feel like Jacob and Marlena had chemistry too, and in my opinion this way it was more realistic (both men loved her and she also cared about both of them). \n\nI loved the movie, and I really recommend it to everyone.

It is well done and those who cherish in this type of drama will have more to "win" from watchin this, than others do.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1559,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-01-16","keywords":"nazareth israel,pig farmer,bus stop,waiting at a bus stop,reference to 9 11","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Holy Lands","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3820338969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg4ODIzNDMtOTcwMi00NDczLTlkOTctM2I0NjM4NGQyZDE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDg4ODIzNDMtOTcwMi00NDczLTlkOTctM2I0NjM4NGQyZDE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001667/","name":"Jonathan Rhys Meyers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000275/","name":"Rosanna Arquette","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001001/","name":"James Caan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1923551/","name":"Amanda Sthers"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190089/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036163/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1923551/","name":"Amanda Sthers"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Surprising, right?","reviewBody":"Written by Richard Salvatore and directed by George Gallo, this film noir features an incredibly talented cast: John Travolta, Morgan Freeman, Brendan Fraser, Famke Janssen, Peter Stormare, and Robert Patrick. Surprisingly, this is the first movie that John Travolta and Morgan Freeman have ever been in together. With that much star power, this movie should have been excellent. Unfortunately, it's not.\n\nThe Good: It's a pleasure watching John Travolta and Morgan Freeman, even in bad movies. I was shocked when I first saw Brendan Frasier on the screen. I hadn't seen pictures of his recent weight gain and wondered if he did it intentionally for this film. He didn't but I thought his acting was outstanding in his role as the doctor. I've always been a fan.\n\nI like Famke Janssen and thought she played a southern belle well. She looked like she had some new cheek implants done recently. Why do beautiful women in Hollywood mess up their original beauty?\n\nIt was great to see Ella Bleu Travolta star with her father in a movie. I felt bad that the script mostly had her crying during the entire movie. She was also in the movie Old Dogs with her dad. She is one of those rare teenagers who actually likes her parents and isn't embarrassed by them.\n\nThe music sounded like it came from a 1970's drama and set the right tone from the very beginning.\n\nSome have criticized the Texas drawl that the actors tried to master but I thought everyone sounded fine.\n\nThe Bad: You can almost guess what happens by just watching the trailer. Even with a twist, it's predictable. What's the opposite of energetic? That's this movie. Everyone seemed very tired the entire time. The ending left me underwhelmed. The shoot-out scenes are a bit sloppy. Characters conveniently appear and disappear in the story, leaving messy holes that leave you wondering "What was the point of that?" It tries to be deep, but it's not.\n\nYou can read the rest of my review at Movie Review Mom","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7934,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-09-11","keywords":"private detective,murder","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Poison Rose","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2402728985","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg4ZDRhOWMtNmE1MC00YTNhLWE4YmMtOTQ5YzA4N2JkN2E2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg4ZDRhOWMtNmE1MC00YTNhLWE4YmMtOTQ5YzA4N2JkN2E2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4209533/","name":"Francesco Cinquemani"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0303032/","name":"George Gallo"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0809942/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209560/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362409/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4209533/","name":"Francesco Cinquemani"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8729010/","name":"Luca Giliberto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0759363/","name":"Richard Salvatore"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Surprising, right?","reviewBody":"Written by Richard Salvatore and directed by George Gallo, this film noir features an incredibly talented cast: John Travolta, Morgan Freeman, Brendan Fraser, Famke Janssen, Peter Stormare, and Robert Patrick. Surprisingly, this is the first movie that John Travolta and Morgan Freeman have ever been in together. With that much star power, this movie should have been excellent. Unfortunately, it's not.\n\nThe Good: It's a pleasure watching John Travolta and Morgan Freeman, even in bad movies. I was shocked when I first saw Brendan Frasier on the screen. I hadn't seen pictures of his recent weight gain and wondered if he did it intentionally for this film. He didn't but I thought his acting was outstanding in his role as the doctor. I've always been a fan.\n\nI like Famke Janssen and thought she played a southern belle well. She looked like she had some new cheek implants done recently. Why do beautiful women in Hollywood mess up their original beauty?\n\nIt was great to see Ella Bleu Travolta star with her father in a movie. I felt bad that the script mostly had her crying during the entire movie. She was also in the movie Old Dogs with her dad. She is one of those rare teenagers who actually likes her parents and isn't embarrassed by them.\n\nThe music sounded like it came from a 1970's drama and set the right tone from the very beginning.\n\nSome have criticized the Texas drawl that the actors tried to master but I thought everyone sounded fine.\n\nThe Bad: You can almost guess what happens by just watching the trailer. Even with a twist, it's predictable. What's the opposite of energetic? That's this movie. Everyone seemed very tired the entire time. The ending left me underwhelmed. The shoot-out scenes are a bit sloppy. Characters conveniently appear and disappear in the story, leaving messy holes that leave you wondering "What was the point of that?" It tries to be deep, but it's not.\n\nYou can read the rest of my review at Movie Review Mom","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7934,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-09-11","keywords":"private detective,murder","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Poison Rose","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2402728985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg4ZDRhOWMtNmE1MC00YTNhLWE4YmMtOTQ5YzA4N2JkN2E2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg4ZDRhOWMtNmE1MC00YTNhLWE4YmMtOTQ5YzA4N2JkN2E2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000151/","name":"Morgan Freeman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4209533/","name":"Francesco Cinquemani","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0303032/","name":"George Gallo"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0809942/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209560/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0362409/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4209533/","name":"Francesco Cinquemani","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8729010/","name":"Luca Giliberto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0759363/","name":"Richard Salvatore"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The alienated Polish characters and enhancement of their relationship during the work are phenomenally inspiring, but the Chinese stereotypes - especially the childish director with his beloved goldfish - are not convincing at all.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-10-27","keywords":"town","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695835/","name":"Kinga Preis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115711/","name":"Stanislaw Brudny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452609/","name":"Krzysztof Kiersznowski"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477187/","name":"Michal Kwiecinski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034872/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1008161/","name":"Jaroslaw Sokól"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

And it's a good one. Whereas "The Godfather" was a splashy violent well-done gangster movie dealing with power and sex, and persuading us to sympathize with a family at least as murderous as that in "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre," this one has to do with something else entirely. It's not about that old theme of illusion vs. reality. Nobody plays, say, Jack the Ripper in a stage play and then begins to butcher women on the streets. It has to do, rather, with the interpretation of reality (whatever that is), which is an issue of a different color.\n\nBriefly, Harry Caul (Hackman) is hired by "the director," who seems to be a rich and powerful executive, to spy on a young woman and the guy she's seeing (Cindy Williams and Frederick Forrest). He's the best surveillance technician on the West Coast and he does an ace job of capturing them on film and audiotape while they wander around Union Square in downtown San Francisco. Harry puts the pieces together and suspects the Director plans to murder them. Well, this isn't Harry's first time at bat here. Back in New York, doing his usual dispassionately expert job of spying, he was responsible for the deaths of a man, his wife, and his child, the incident that drove him to The City. He's a very secretive guy, Harry, and minds his own business, but he's not about to let THAT happen again. When he tried to withhold his tapes from The Director, the tapes are stolen. And when he tries to interfere further a murder does in fact take place. But Harry had it backwards. He interpreted everything on his tapes as signs that the young couple were in danger from The Director, whereas in fact the couple had been planning to murder him for the inheritance, and they succeed too.\n\nYou can never truly be sure that your interpretations of what's going on are the correct ones because, as Kant argued, our interpretations are limited by our perceptual apparatus, just as Harry's interpretations were limited to what he could learn from four unidirectional microphones, a camera, and a hidden portable mike attached to a receiver. And what all this electronic junk told him was real enough but so ambiguous that its meaning could be twisted one way or another.\n\nThe movie is rife with symbolism that I'm not sure I'm getting because it too is ambiguous. Harry is as secretive as anyone can be without being frankly paranoid. Nobody knows his home phone number. His girlfriend, who deserts him, doesn't know his birthday or his age. A "cawl" is the thin layer of white fat that covers and conceals a piece of meat such as a leg of lamb. But Harry's raincoat is translucent, one of those ugly plastic ones you can pretty much see through. And he wears prominent glasses so his sight can't be what it used to be. And, after all, an envious competitor in the bugging business does manage to plant a hidden mike on Harry and record a private conversation. And somebody does get Harry's home phone, calls him up and tells him, "We're watching you." (This leads to Harry's tearing his whole apartment apart in a futile search for the hidden mike, and leaves him playing a desolate tenor sax while sitting alone on the floor.) Harry has no family. His assistant, John Cazale, is a little too inquisitive and is fired. Someone describes Harry as "anonymous and lonely." But he's neither anonymous nor lonely. God and "The Director" know who he is, where he lives, and what he does. And everywhere Harry goes he is now accompanied by his guilty conscience. Oh, Harry's got a lot of company. Or, as he tells his new fake girlfriend while listening to the tapes, "It's no ordinary conversation. It makes me feel -- something."\n\nThere aren't too many weaknesses. There's a murky dream sequence in which Harry describes his childhood paralysis, but it doesn't have too much to do with the person we know as an adult. Cazale is professional and sympathetic. Allan Garfield is a standout in a mostly comic role as Hackman's jealous rival, a blustery showman who pulls jokes on everyone including himself. The way he uses his blonde assistant in a tiny dress to help him display his wares at a buggery convention is hilarious. He's like an on-stage magician cracking jokes while he stuffs the doves up his sleeve. The party scene reminds me of "La Dolce Vita" when the party-goers explore the ancient castle. People inhabit vast empty echoing spaces. Most of the time they are blocked from one another by iron gratings or hanging sheets of plastic. They whisper intimacies to fantasies.\n\nThe score is fine. Carmine Coppola uses old melodies behind some of the scenes, and a tinkling puzzling piano statement behind most of the incidents. Sensibly the screen is left silent except for natural noises when Harry looks into the scene of the murder he thinks he witnessed.\n\nYou know, sometimes it's possible to read too much into something, to see Gestalts where there be no Gestalts. I don't know if I'm making something out of nothing, but is it a coincidence that Harry's birthday falls on the same day he develops a conscience? Or that on the same day, the Director's assistant offers him "Christmas cookies"? Is it pure chance that the repetitive song "Red Red Robin" contains the line, "Still I listen for hours and hours"? That the assistant's name, Stett, means "leave it alone" in Latin? \n\nThere's much more to be said about this film but I don't want to run out of space so I'll simply recommend seeing it. In its own quiet way it's a far more provocative movie than "The Godfather."","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1974-04-12","keywords":"paranoia,surveillance,murder,recording,saxophone","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Conversation","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3367419417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDgxNTM1NGEtNmNhMS00MTc0LTk5NGQtNGY1YzY3MTRlNzZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDgxNTM1NGEtNmNhMS00MTc0LTk5NGQtNGY1YzY3MTRlNzZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000432/","name":"Gene Hackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001030/","name":"John Cazale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307255/","name":"Allen Garfield"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079404/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099634/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020958/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In its own quiet way it's a far more provocative movie than "The Godfather."","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":106104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1974-04-12","keywords":"paranoia,surveillance,murder,recording,saxophone","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Conversation","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3367419417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDgxNTM1NGEtNmNhMS00MTc0LTk5NGQtNGY1YzY3MTRlNzZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDgxNTM1NGEtNmNhMS00MTc0LTk5NGQtNGY1YzY3MTRlNzZkXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000432/","name":"Gene Hackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001030/","name":"John Cazale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307255/","name":"Allen Garfield"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079404/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0099634/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020958/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000338/","name":"Francis Ford Coppola"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The new movie by Florian von Donnersmarck mesmerized me from the very beginning - the way he can capture the atmosphere, the way he portrays a main hero and even every little character is outstanding and you can literally never look away while watching this modern masterpiece. I actually don't understand why some movie titles are translated into other languages with their own meanings because "Never look away" does not fully capture the true meaning of it while "Work without author" does that almost perfectly. The author of another great one ("The lives of others", 2006) has not outdone himself but came pretty close to doing so: a movie that's so versatile, so multidimensional that you just can't fully figure it out on watch one - it needs to be watched many times. A story of a young boy growing up, facing difficulties, experiencing life changing moments, disappointments, reevaluations in search of an answer to the eternal question: who am I in this fast-changing world? - does it ever get old? I don't think so.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19102,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-03","keywords":"east germany,painter,doctor,forced abortion,pregnancy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1224587801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThhNzU3YTktOTgwZS00OTY0LTgwNDctYmI1YWIyYTA1YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThhNzU3YTktOTgwZS00OTY0LTgwNDctYmI1YWIyYTA1YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Never Look Away' follows thirty years in the life of artist Kurt Barnert (a character loosely based on Gerhard Richter).

The new movie by Florian von Donnersmarck mesmerized me from the very beginning - the way he can capture the atmosphere, the way he portrays a main hero and even every little character is outstanding and you can literally never look away while watching this modern masterpiece. I actually don't understand why some movie titles are translated into other languages with their own meanings because "Never look away" does not fully capture the true meaning of it while "Work without author" does that almost perfectly. The author of another great one ("The lives of others", 2006) has not outdone himself but came pretty close to doing so: a movie that's so versatile, so multidimensional that you just can't fully figure it out on watch one - it needs to be watched many times. A story of a young boy growing up, facing difficulties, experiencing life changing moments, disappointments, reevaluations in search of an answer to the eternal question: who am I in this fast-changing world? - does it ever get old? I don't think so.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19102,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-03","keywords":"east germany,painter,doctor,forced abortion,pregnancy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1224587801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThhNzU3YTktOTgwZS00OTY0LTgwNDctYmI1YWIyYTA1YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMThhNzU3YTktOTgwZS00OTY0LTgwNDctYmI1YWIyYTA1YjA4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"'Never Look Away' follows thirty years in the life of artist Kurt Barnert (a character loosely based on Gerhard Richter).

Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.\n\nAt an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.\n\nWritten by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic "group of isolated people getting picked off one by one". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.\n\nSure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled "too deep" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.\n\nKicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.\n\nAesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative). When outside, the film uses the limited visibility to its advantage in establishing a tone of ominous danger. Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.\n\nElsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P. Lovecraft, particularly Cthulhu, Abner Marín's creature design is suitably creepy and grotesque. The aesthetic element that really stood out for me, however, was Wayne Lemmer's sound design. The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.\n\nIn terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995). There's also next to no characterisation. We learn bits and pieces about Norah and Lucien's backstories, but apart from that, the film is peopled by perfunctory cardboard cut-outs with no sense of interiority. Eubank also seems somewhat confused as to whether he's making a disaster movie or a monster movie, with certain scenes and elements suggesting one or the other. However, he never really finds a middle-ground, giving the film a slightly schizophrenic tone.\n\nAlthough Underwater never manages to rise anywhere near the heights of films such as Alien and Sunshine, it deserved better treatment than it received from Fox and Disney. Given the January release, the clichéd setup, the two-year limbo, and the bland title, I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised. It won't change your life, but it's an entertaining and well-made creature-feature.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":72551,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-01-10","keywords":"sea monster,lovecraftian,ocean,group of survivors,monster","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1414249497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDAwYmZkNzctZGU4Yy00ODQwLTkxNzgtNjc4OGM0OTI4M2ExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A crew of underwater researchers must scramble to safety after an earthquake devastates their subterranean laboratory.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829576/","name":"Kristen Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001993/","name":"Vincent Cassel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6974206/","name":"Mamoudou Athie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1827931/","name":"William Eubank"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3929259/","name":"Brian Duffield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3092414/","name":"Adam Cozad"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Now that it's finally seeing the light of day, there's a real sense of Disney just wanting to be rid of Fox's clutter, and they either didn't know how to promote it or didn't want to promote it, as the marketing campaign has been next to invisible (and the bland title certainly doesn't help), with the film grossing a paltry $7 million in its opening weekend. From Disney's perspective, of course, releasing it in the January release window makes sense, as it's a period traditionally dominated by duds and cast-offs - films the studios don't care about for one reason or another. A recent high-profile example is Blackhat (2015), Michael Mann's underrated cyber-terrorism drama, which was released with little to no advertising, grossing only $20 million at the North American box office against a $70 million budget. However, much like Blackhat, Underwater is considerably better than most January releases. Sure, it's clichéd and predictable, and it shamelessly borrows from a litany of superior genre films, but it's also a very entertaining and enjoyable aquatic creature-feature.\n\nAt an unspecified point in the future, Tian Industries, the largest drilling company in the world, are attempting to drill into the ocean floor at the bottom of the Mariana Trench, almost seven miles down, with atmospheric pressure over 1,000 times that at sea-level, strong enough to crush a human body so completely that there aren't even any remains. As the film begins, Kepler Station, the crew quarters of Tian's massive drilling rig, is hit by a series of unexplained vibrations, causing a cascading pressure breach. Norah Price (Kristen Stewart) and Rodrigo Nagenda (Mamoudou Athie) are the only ones to escape, sealing off the area so as to slow, but not prevent the inevitable implosion of the whole rig. Heading first to the escape pod dock, they find no pods left, and in the control base, they're unable to contact the surface. Meanwhile, they encounter some other survivors - Cpt. Lucian (Vincent Cassel), Paul Abel (T.J. Miller), Liam Smith (John Gallagher Jr.), and Emily Havisham (Jessica Henwick). With their situation grim, Lucien says the only hope they have is to use pressurised suits to walk the one-mile distance to the Roebuck Drilling Station and use the escape pods located there. And so they descend to the dark ocean floor. However, as if their task wasn't daunting enough, they soon discover that they aren't alone.\n\nWritten by Brian Duffield and Adam Cozad, and directed by William Eubank, Underwater walks a very fine line between rip-off and homage. The most obvious touchstones, both narratively and aesthetically, are Alien (1979) and The Abyss (1989), but one can also see the influence of films such as Leviathan (1989), Event Horizon (1997), Sphere (1998), and Sunshine (2007). I even detected a slight nod to The Descent (2005). In short, the set-up is your classic "group of isolated people getting picked off one by one". When someone as talented as Danny Boyle turns his hand to this template, the result is a near-masterpiece. And although Eubank is most certainly no Boyle, Underwater is a lot better than its lack of advertising, clichéd premise, bland title, and generic trailer suggest.\n\nSure, it isn't really about much of anything. There's a vague ecological theme that's brought up a couple of times, with Emily talking about how humans have drilled "too deep" and are now suffering the consequences, but really, it never amounts to anything even half-way substantial. In all fairness though, who would be expecting thematic complexity anyway? You know what you're getting with a film like this, and the best you can hope for is that it looks good and is entertaining. And Underwater is both.\n\nKicking into high-gear immediately, the film wastes no time whatsoever in getting to the action. The opening scene is the Kepler implosion, and it's a good five minutes before things calm down. Alien takes its time getting anywhere, introducing us to the aesthetic of the Nostromo, then the characters and their relationships and milieu before it all kicks off. In essence, Underwater is the inverse of that, with all hell breaking loose before we know much of anything about anyone. Indeed, the only character we even see, let alone get to know, before the implosion is Norah. I certainly wouldn't want every film to open this way, but it has an undeniable kineticism and appealing volatility, which Eubank does a decent job of maintaining throughout the next 95 minutes.\n\nAesthetically, there's a lot to like here. Production design is absolutely paramount in films like this (think of how important design elements are in building tension and establishing tone in Alien or Event Horizon), and designer Naaman Marshall does a fine job, with the world feeling lived-in and authentic. Making especially good use of tunnels and low ceilings, there's a real sense of claustrophobia, which only lets up, ironically enough, when the characters are outside the safety of the rig and exposed to multiple dangers. This claustrophobia is aided immensely by Bojan Bazelli's cinematography. During scenes outside, Bazelli often shoots from within the characters' helmets, and even when the characters are inside, he often shoots in tight close-ups, simultaneously anchoring us to their perspectives and heightening the sense of enclosure and pressure (both literal and figurative).

Some will probably find these scenes too dark, but I'd argue that that is precisely the point; the characters can't see much of anything, and neither can we.\n\nElsewhere, obviously inspired by H.P.

The implosion scenes are accompanied with some bone-rattling LFE, whilst the ominous ambient sounds of the Kepler are a constant reminder that the station is on its last legs. The scenes outside are equally as impressive, with some excellent use of directional sound as the action shifts location on screen - it's a film that I would imagine will sound incredible on a 7.1.2 Atmos system.\n\nIn terms of problems, there's a rather unjustified use of voiceover to bookend things, explaining the moral of the story; it's wholly unnecessary and has the effect of making the film feel like an episode of The Outer Limits (1995).

I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. \n\nWhat it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.\n\nNow is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. \n\nNow to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.\n\nWhy was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year.

This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.\n\nYou should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings. Why is this rated-R?It has so many intense scenes that if you get inside this movie it is truly haunting. Now maybe this movie was too powerful for many people, it was probably even shocking for realists. Maybe though its not that surprising that so many people don't like this movie because the truth hurts. Not the truth about corruption or about people but the truth about ourselves.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":547034,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-02-27","keywords":"oil,misanthrope,loss of hearing,1910s,prospector","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"There Will Be Blood","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1341980953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRhOWY5N2EtYzk0NS00ZTFlLTk4MTktMzdhYWM5OGFmMDM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmRhOWY5N2EtYzk0NS00ZTFlLTk4MTktMzdhYWM5OGFmMDM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Miramax"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000358/","name":"Daniel Day-Lewis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200452/","name":"Paul Dano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001354/","name":"Ciarán Hinds"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000759/","name":"Paul Thomas Anderson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027686/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000759/","name":"Paul Thomas Anderson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0801737/","name":"Upton Sinclair"}],"duration":"PT2H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I can understand that this movie is so depressing in so may ways. \n\nWhat it shows that Big Fish eats Litte Fish and none of us want to think about that anymore than most of us experience it in our daily life. It shows the battle between the evangelicals and the corporate business man. Or maybe even the battle between evangelicals of today and the non-religious people or atheists of today. Even worse is that this movie shows that religious people, priests are or can be as bad as a corrupt oil man. Maybe why people did not like this movie is because it might have offended them. Especially Paul Dano playing the priest. Both Daniel Day Lewis and Paul Dano are wrong and too extreme on their opinions. People are able to accept this. What people cannot accept is though that these same extremities and same misguided opinions from both characters are very much true in that they are heavily believed still today. Not all Christains are like Paul Dano's character and not all business man are like Daniel Day Lewis's character but many are like them. That is the world we live in.\n\nNow is their any alternative or positive side? The answer is yes and that is H.W. the son of Daniel Plainview(Daniel Day Lewis). He epitomizes hope. He shows that despite being deaf and having a father who uses him as a ploy for better business he can still break free of the chains that he is being tied down by. What separates H.W. from the residents and evangelists of Little Boston? The difference is that he and his father are educated and they are not. That is how Daniel Plainview is able to manipulate and cheat them the Sunday family, even Eli Sunday(Paul Dano) the priest and preacher of Little Boston. From what H.W. sees and experiences he sees that much of what is around him is just wrong. He uses his experience that he had gained as a kid to break free of the corruption and chaos that could have taken over him. That is one aspect of the education I'am talking about: our experiences and understanding of what is happening around us. \n\nNow to get to the technical aspects of There Will Be Blood. It is just truly spectacular in every way. First off the acting was amazing. Daniel Day Lewis gave arguably the best performance of his career playing Daniel Plaiview or ever since movies began to be made. He freaked me out and probably shocked many people. His thirst for power and money was at such a high level that it made me wonder about what people are really capable of. The deceiving, the greed, the thirst for power and the every man for himself attitude actually looked more real than ever to me. Without Daniel Day Lewis I don't think this movie could have achieved what it has. Paul Dano gave a great performance as Eli Sunday though people tend to disagree. I think he gave a great portrayal of an extremist evangelical priest of how he himself had his own thirst for power and how he was more blasphemous then respectful and gracious to god then how you would expect a priest to be. How could people not be shocked by these two characters, I was myself.\n\nWhy was the music for this movie not liked. I thought this was among the top five musical scores I have ever heard. The music perfectly gave you the feeling of the corruption and deception setting into the movie. It perfectly intertwined with the rest of the movie as the movie itself was ever growingly becoming more and more chaotic and surreal. Probably too shocking though.\n\nPaul Thomas Anderson I believe gave the best directing job of the year. He was able to show the oil fields and its processes, the rise of an oil man, the way everyone can be bought even a priest and the hope that H.W. represented. This movie was never boring and it was as stunning of a directing job as Daniel Day Lewis gave as a performance for his role in this movie. The intensity of this movie was as high as a movie could possibly be and some of the credit for this has to go to the director. The cinematography and the music seemed to intertwine perfectly like the rest of the movie. It gave the sense of the time period and as said before the greed, deception, etc. The cinematography did not just give you a negative feeling but a feeling as if what you are watching is real.\n\nYou should not like this movie just because of the great technical achievements as you should not for any movie but for what it says and how it says it. I'm not even sure if you should enjoy this movie in general but you should not be blinded by your opinions. I applaud you whoever out there who can somewhat understand this movie and get past the lying and deceiving we do to ourselves. This movie really shows the humanity of human beings.

I was more of a Rocco's modern life guy. When is he coming out with a movie? But you don't need to be a fan of the cartoon before, to love the movie now. \n\nHalf 2D animation like the TV show, half live action with Spongebob and his friends done in 3D CGI, Antonio Banderas plays a pirate captain of a ship telling what feels like another episode of Spongebob with Plankton's new attempt on trying to steel the formula for Krabby patties to make the Chum Bucket better. Than to flip the script on us, the pirate captain steels the formula forcing the gang to travel to the surface to get it back.\n\nIt's a funny cartoon style comedy. It's been a while since I've seen some slap stick cartoon animation and the sponge delivers squeezing the laughter right out of you (pun). It was a lot of little giggles leading up to a few big laughs. You can't help it. A lot of smart people worked hard to make these guys real stupid.\n\nAnd I love it when animation goes to the limit with it's story telling. Spongebob had a very surrealistic feel. Just like the cartoon, it was like I was on something but don't need to be to enjoy the fun.\n\nAnd that was what the cartoon was in a nutshell, fun. Playful for all audiences no matter what the age.

I was more of a Rocco's modern life guy. When is he coming out with a movie? But you don't need to be a fan of the cartoon before, to love the movie now. \n\nHalf 2D animation like the TV show, half live action with Spongebob and his friends done in 3D CGI, Antonio Banderas plays a pirate captain of a ship telling what feels like another episode of Spongebob with Plankton's new attempt on trying to steel the formula for Krabby patties to make the Chum Bucket better. Than to flip the script on us, the pirate captain steels the formula forcing the gang to travel to the surface to get it back.\n\nIt's a funny cartoon style comedy. It's been a while since I've seen some slap stick cartoon animation and the sponge delivers squeezing the laughter right out of you (pun). It was a lot of little giggles leading up to a few big laughs. You can't help it. A lot of smart people worked hard to make these guys real stupid.\n\nAnd I love it when animation goes to the limit with it's story telling. Spongebob had a very surrealistic feel. Just like the cartoon, it was like I was on something but don't need to be to enjoy the fun.\n\nAnd that was what the cartoon was in a nutshell, fun. Playful for all audiences no matter what the age. Total good time at the movies.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52468,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-30","keywords":"dinosaur,formula,plankton,secret formula,bubble","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi421768985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTY1NDEwNTY2MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODMwNjYxMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"After spending his entire life under the sea in the Bikini Bottom Gulch, Spongebob, Patrick and the rest of their friends go on a quest to find the stolen recipe for their Krabby Patty burgers, which brings them into our world, where they encounter a nefarious pirate named Burger-Beard.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0444786/","name":"Tom Kenny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0265067/","name":"Bill Fagerbakke"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1196684/","name":"Paul Tibbitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593610/","name":"Mike Mitchell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390995/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0004265/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020957/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0008743/","name":"Jonathan Aibel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0074184/","name":"Glenn Berger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0384864/","name":"Stephen Hillenburg"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So this big-budget remake of the 1960 classic comes as a welcome breath of tobacco-filled air, even if it doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. But as a piece of popcorn entertainment, it fires on all cylinders. Not surprisingly with Antoine Fuqua (Training Day, The Equalizer, Shooter) calling the shots, subtlety is pushed aside for frenetic set pieces and belief-defying heroics, especially in the wild climactic showdown that demonstrates minimal CGI does not equal minimal fun. Amongst all the balletic gunplay and macho posturing there's a relatively simple story: town is overrun by a dastardly villain (Peter Sarsgaard oozing creepiness), town employs cowboys-for-hire (guess how many) for protection, town fights with said cowboys leading the way. That the plot requires little more explanation then that highlights the focus of the movie, for better and for worse, however the fact it never feels shallow or superficial can be attributed to the exhilarating action and the ultra-cool cast. And what a fantastic cast it is. Denzel Washington is reliably charismatic as the contemplative leader, Chris Pratt is magnetic as the group's joker, Ethan Hawke is intense as the tormented sniper, Byung-hun Lee is enigmatic as the blade-wielding assassin, Vincent D'Onofrio is intriguing as the philosophical killer and Haley Bennett is fierce as the townswoman who stands her ground. Best of all, the eclectic characters – also including Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as the rowdy Mexican and Martin Sensmeier as the Indian warrior – share a wonderful chemistry that makes them utterly watchable from start to finish. An energetic remake with style to spare, The Magnificent Seven is a rip-roaring adventure that'll please long-neglected Western fans to no end.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":199961,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Western"],"datePublished":"2016-09-23","keywords":"showdown,remake,industrialist,bounty hunter,gunfighter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3980375833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTYyNTAyMTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA5NjE3NDkx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTYyNTAyMTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA5NjE3NDkx._V1_.jpg","description":"With the town of Rose Creek under the deadly control of industrialist Bartholomew Bogue, the desperate townspeople employ protection from seven outlaws, bounty hunters, gamblers and hired guns.

This film tells a real dramatic event, which even today opens wounds and consequences in the families of the victims, poor families that have not yet received real reparation from the state of Chile. Organizations for the protection of women in Chile are condemning this production that profits from this tragedy and is once again re-victimizing the case and affecting even more the families of the girls and women who suffered this real tragedy. That's horrible! This should have been a serious documentary of reparation for the victims and not a commercial product that also distorts reality.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":70,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2021-03-14","keywords":"northern chile,one word title,serial killer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4461567/","name":"Daniel Candia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1275107/","name":"Cristián Chaparro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12434889/","name":"Karin Mayorinca"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7100327/","name":"Álvaro Muñoz"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0583592/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1146177/","name":"Omar Saavedra Santis"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When the community is suddenly attacked from both sides, the doctor is tested by his own limits and integrity in order to protect and rescue. Shocking and extremely convincing, it paints an accurate canvas on human rights being distorted by modern insanity, greed and fanaticism.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-20","keywords":"doctor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi115719961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRhZDdhMzMtMzFkNC00MmRjLTg5NmQtODIzY2FkODE2ZDg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTRhZDdhMzMtMzFkNC00MmRjLTg5NmQtODIzY2FkODE2ZDg3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0066080/","name":"Ramzy Bedia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5602480/","name":"Amel Brahim-Djelloul","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3370158/","name":"Slimane Dazi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140699/","name":"Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015899/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063732/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014456/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1140699/","name":"Rabah Ameur-Zaïmeche"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I'm hooked to start, with a opening shot that's held uncomfortably long, ambitious considering the overall thrifty run time. It's stark with a retro grade and worn VHS look. The minimal aesthetic really appeals, but there's something missing, there's very little warmth or investment in the characters, with a palatable dirt on screen that permeates everything. For all the tension being ramped, the grime, the editing, the hyper scripted dialogue, it all slowly pulls apart. Despite it's stunted plot of a devilish nature and generally undesirable characters, there are some pluses. The score being one, reminiscent of an 80s slasher flick, it's definitely the films strongest asset. The European art house feel makes it feel cinematic, intentionally confusing in nature. Scenes built around slow creeping shots, almost entirely on one set, with often inactive people, waiting. Director Tillman Singer clearly has a thing for Lynch. As things progress it does manage to find its feet, with a second act reminiscent of a small theatre play, time frames overlapping, lines twisting through their own narrative into others, it's wonderfully bonkers, albeit a tad overplayed. It's all precursor to a truly off the wall finale, that although ambitious, really just doesn't work and ends in a bit of a disjointed mess. It really doesn't live up to its trailer, but I'm still pleased I gave it a go.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2370,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-03-21","keywords":"demon,hypnosis,chamber drama,reality,one word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Luz","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3726490649","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdlZmI3Y2QtNjFkNS00NDdhLTg1ZTYtNGYwZWFhMTQ4MGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdlZmI3Y2QtNjFkNS00NDdhLTg1ZTYtNGYwZWFhMTQ4MGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer #1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9547430/","name":"Luana Velis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1919245/","name":"Johannes Benecke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849059/","name":"Jan Bluthardt"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849061/","name":"Tilman Singer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053103/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849061/","name":"Tilman Singer"}],"duration":"PT1H10M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm hooked to start, with a opening shot that's held uncomfortably long, ambitious considering the overall thrifty run time. It's stark with a retro grade and worn VHS look. The minimal aesthetic really appeals, but there's something missing, there's very little warmth or investment in the characters, with a palatable dirt on screen that permeates everything. For all the tension being ramped, the grime, the editing, the hyper scripted dialogue, it all slowly pulls apart. Despite it's stunted plot of a devilish nature and generally undesirable characters, there are some pluses. The score being one, reminiscent of an 80s slasher flick, it's definitely the films strongest asset. The European art house feel makes it feel cinematic, intentionally confusing in nature. Scenes built around slow creeping shots, almost entirely on one set, with often inactive people, waiting. Director Tillman Singer clearly has a thing for Lynch. As things progress it does manage to find its feet, with a second act reminiscent of a small theatre play, time frames overlapping, lines twisting through their own narrative into others, it's wonderfully bonkers, albeit a tad overplayed. It's all precursor to a truly off the wall finale, that although ambitious, really just doesn't work and ends in a bit of a disjointed mess. It really doesn't live up to its trailer, but I'm still pleased I gave it a go.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2370,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2019-03-21","keywords":"demon,hypnosis,chamber drama,reality,one word title","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Luz","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3726490649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdlZmI3Y2QtNjFkNS00NDdhLTg1ZTYtNGYwZWFhMTQ4MGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDdlZmI3Y2QtNjFkNS00NDdhLTg1ZTYtNGYwZWFhMTQ4MGYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer #1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9547430/","name":"Luana Velis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1919245/","name":"Johannes Benecke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849059/","name":"Jan Bluthardt"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849061/","name":"Tilman Singer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053103/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6849061/","name":"Tilman Singer"],"duration":"PT1H10M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

 --- Description: Fellwechselzeit: Directed by Sabrina Mertens. With Zelda Espenschied, Miriam Schiweck, Freya Kreutzkam, Bernd Wolf. The still life of a family in 57 pictures. Germany in the 1970ies. Stephanie is an intelligent and lively child. But she leads an isolated life with her parents, marked by the symbiotic bonding with her mentally unstable mother. A mother who has never really left her own childhood behind and who lives amidst things of the past and the memories connected to them. Stephanie's relationship with her father is one of mistrust. The passing years only bring aging, but no future. Unspoken thoughts lurk underneath the surface of everyday life. So Stephanie retreats into a dark world of barbaric fantasies, that are nourished by the traces of the past and only belong to her alone. One day, however, Stephanie's secret invades the family's reality." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt11758900/","name":"Fellwechselzeit","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGFkZGQ2ODctZjViOS00Yjc0LThjZjctZjg1YzliNTRlMDVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyODU2NjIzMjc@._V1_.jpg","description":"The still life of a family in 57 pictures.

Much of the humor here is raunchy but it works. It's not one of those dumb raunchy comedies. Some of the best bits happen when Lauren and Katie talk to their customers. One of them is Captain Jerry who's played by Seth Rogen, Lauren Miller's real-life husband. Miller plays proper young woman Lauren Powell. She was also one of the script writers, along with Katie Anne Naylon. They based the script on their real-life experiences as college roommates. Miller's performance is suitable and works well opposite Ari Graynor as Katie Steel. There's commitment from every actor involved but it's Graynor who steals every scene she's in. She has the best lines and she knows it. She plays her character like a pro. At first she doesn't seem appealing to the audience, but as the film progresses she becomes a rounded and likable personality. Although the story is set in the modern day the film still seems like one of those films from the early-1990s. It reminded me of Clerks (1994). A good script and a good setup make For A Good Time, Call... one of the better comedies of 2012.

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":691185,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As the movie opens, it is immediately clear that homosexuality is prohibited in Nigeria, driving gays and others in the LGTBQ+ community underground. We are introduced to Micheal, who describes his ordeal, which led him to move to the US. Now, after 7 years away, he plans a return visit to Nigeria to see for himself how things have changed (if at all)... At this point we are 10 min. Into the documentary.\n\nCouple of comments: this film is co-directed by Giselle Bailey and Nneka Onuorah. Equally important, the film is produced by John Legend's Get Lifted film company. To say that Nigeria is a dangerous place for the LGTBQ+ community, would be the understatement of the year. The Nigerian authorities are openly and without any shame or scruples encouraging the hunting down of anyone suspected to be "different", leading to senseless and shameful violence against those who are "different". Beware: there is shocking footage in the film of such incidents that I found difficult to stomach, which of course is the entire point of having that footage in the film.

As the movie opens, it is immediately clear that homosexuality is prohibited in Nigeria, driving gays and others in the LGTBQ+ community underground. We are introduced to Micheal, who describes his ordeal, which led him to move to the US. Now, after 7 years away, he plans a return visit to Nigeria to see for himself how things have changed (if at all)... At this point we are 10 min. Into the documentary.\n\nCouple of comments: this film is co-directed by Giselle Bailey and Nneka Onuorah. Equally important, the film is produced by John Legend's Get Lifted film company. To say that Nigeria is a dangerous place for the LGTBQ+ community, would be the understatement of the year. The Nigerian authorities are openly and without any shame or scruples encouraging the hunting down of anyone suspected to be "different", leading to senseless and shameful violence against those who are "different". Beware: there is shocking footage in the film of such incidents that I found difficult to stomach, which of course is the entire point of having that footage in the film. Kudos to the film makers, who clearly spent a significant amount of time "embedded" in the LGTBQ+ community to provide this rich yet frightening portrait.\n\n"The Legend of the Underground" premiered earlier this week on HBO and is not available on HBO On Demand, HBO Max, Amazon Instant Video and other streaming services. The DVD/Blu-ray release will follow in due course. If you want to get a clear sense on what life is like for the LGTBQ+ in a truly homophobic county like Nigeria, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":116,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2021-06-29","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1698676761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1MDJkYjQtOGNlZS00ODU1LTlhZWMtMmUzNDY1OWQxYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTM1MDJkYjQtOGNlZS00ODU1LTlhZWMtMmUzNDY1OWQxYmMyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Accessible original trailer.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12656508/","name":"James Brown","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6319114/","name":"Denrele","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7250120/","name":"Denrele Edun"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4054614/","name":"Giselle Bailey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5283727/","name":"Nneka Onuorah"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0351101/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139821/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0154622/"],"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Music deserves a separate mention as it adds impact to the dramatic nature of the film.\n\n#moviesshmovies","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":39986,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"2020-03-06","keywords":"alcoholism,basketball movie,basketball coach,cemetery,underdog","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2639839001","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIzYmVkY2QtNTZlMy00MzE4LWE3NDktZWEzMGE2MjZmZmU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWIzYmVkY2QtNTZlMy00MzE4LWE3NDktZWEzMGE2MjZmZmU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Jack Cunningham (Ben Affleck) once had a life filled with promise. In high school, he was a basketball phenom with a full university scholarship, when suddenly, for reasons unknown, he walked away from the game, forfeiting his future. Now years later, Jack is spiralling down, triggered by an unspeakable loss, and drowning in the alcoholism that cost him his marriage and any hope for a better life. When he is asked to coach the basketball team at his alma mater, which has fallen far since his glory days, he reluctantly accepts, surprising no one more than himself. As the boys start to come together as a team and win, Jack may have finally found a reason to confront the demons that have derailed him. But will it be enough to fill the void, heal the deep wounds of his past, and set him on the road to redemption?","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000255/","name":"Ben Affleck","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1371339/","name":"Al Madrigal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1232470/","name":"Janina Gavankar"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0640334/","name":"Gavin O'Connor"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0309252/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0706942/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2145487/","name":"Brad Ingelsby"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The subtitle The Second Part is surely a half truth considering how this narrative slapped together by the original writers Christopher Miller and Phil Lord seems tacked on in a "Oh let's take a victory lap then" sense. The new director Mike Mitchell is planted into a zero sum game as he tries to reignite the novelty of the first film while propelling a more mature plot that Miller and Lord insisted on being needlessly convoluted. This sequel comes off as a afterthought worthy to stand beside the other spinoff LEGO films, but lacks all of the magic of its predecessor.\n\nThe magic present in The LEGO Movie resides in the playful allegory of capitalism mixed with the earned nostalgia of the animation's medium. Not to mention the brilliant reveal of a child's imagination directing the entire story.

Her entry-level LEGO creations clash with his more involved and complex structures, and the result is a sibling pair never learning to play in symbiosis. Of course this conflict is merely implied before the lazy live action finale that resolves the paper thin dispute, and wholly lacks the gusto of the first movie's twist. The jig is already up from scene one of the sequel, because we are aware of the children's narrative dictatorship, so none of the LEGO characters' sentience ever feels authentic.\n\nChris Pratt returns to voice Emmet a happy-go-lucky construction worker who retains a life of cheer in the apocalyptic wasteland. Elizabeth Banks also reprises her role as Lucy, the brawn and brains to Emmet's fumbling optimism. Lucy desperately attempts to calibrate Emmet's persona to something more appropriate to the ruined world they now live in, but he maintains the "everything is awesome" outlook that figures problematic in a much more adult environment. In a hardly tongue-in-cheek fashion, a character outright states the thesis of the movie to be "a statement on the waning affects of adolescence on imagination." This stands as the most egregious example of "meta exploitation," but several runner ups tail close behind.\n\nFalling victim to exhausting cleverness, LEGO Movie 2 doesn't know when to edit its goofs. When you merely reformat the first film's plot to fit another child builder, new additions need to elevate the otherwise regurgitated formula. These additions include ramping up the meta meter to 11 and including two more banger tracks to hopefully burrow into the viewers' minds. The main attraction song here has a hook the repeats endlessly, "This song's gonna get stuck inside your head." Oh and I mustn't forget the cameos, which come with This is the End regularity, and if you can imagine, with far less originality.\n\nI didn't waste your time by running you down a plot synopsis for good reason. The film plays with your expectations in a cheap and unearned fashion without offering any reasonable explanation upon the conclusion other than, "We just wanted to plant red herrings, because...reasons." Screenwriters will go to great (and absurd) lengths to make an unoriginal script appear more interesting.

I won't speak to story here as it's covered in the other comments.\n\nThis is a movie of real beauty. It made me cry. I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. It was an inspiration.\n\nThe feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. The words were real and human. The relationships seemed real and human. This may not seem like a great feat - but I consider it a true rarity. It didn't feel calculated and artificial, like so many movies (read: Crash - but I'm not here to bash that...). It was very organic, natural and (I can't say it enough) just beautiful. Cripes, it's making me sound like a hippie, for heaven's sake. This for me was Penn's best work since Indian Runner.\n\nWhat it reminded me of...\n\n\n* Terence Malik - Herzog? - in a strange way Cassavettes? - Hal Ashby (more Coming Home than Harold &amp; Maude...) - even a bit of Ken Loach\n\n\n\n* Ruby in Paradise - Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore - Five Easy Pieces - Easy Rider\n\n\n... but when I list those it's not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although I think you can definitely see the influence of some great films) - it's again because of the heart of it. I heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was "too long" but I don't agree. I think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.\n\nHal Holbrook was just perfect, as was the cast as a whole, and I think Emile Hirsch is really going places - he was fantastic and he owned the role. Eddie Vedder's music worked perfectly as well - not distracting or quirky - just a part of the whole.\n\nThe film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed. Magic.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":596146,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-10-19","keywords":"wilderness,alaska,journey,following a dream,self discovery","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Into The Wild","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1051656473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTViZjU2OTUtOWQwNS00NGY3LTljMjMtZjZjZDgxYmE1MGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTViZjU2OTUtOWQwNS00NGY3LTljMjMtZjZjZDgxYmE1MGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Vantage"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0386472/","name":"Emile Hirsch"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000681/","name":"Vince Vaughn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001416/","name":"Catherine Keener"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079747/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177217/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1040556/","name":"Jon Krakauer"}],"duration":"PT2H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I won't speak to story here as it's covered in the other comments.\n\nThis is a movie of real beauty. It made me cry. I felt moved in a way that happens very rarely. It was an inspiration.\n\nThe feelings it evoked were all based on the power of the acting and the writing. The words were real and human. The relationships seemed real and human. This may not seem like a great feat - but I consider it a true rarity. It didn't feel calculated and artificial, like so many movies (read: Crash - but I'm not here to bash that...). It was very organic, natural and (I can't say it enough) just beautiful. Cripes, it's making me sound like a hippie, for heaven's sake. This for me was Penn's best work since Indian Runner.\n\nWhat it reminded me of...\n\n\n* Terence Malik - Herzog? - in a strange way Cassavettes? - Hal Ashby (more Coming Home than Harold &amp; Maude...) - even a bit of Ken Loach\n\n\n\n* Ruby in Paradise - Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore - Five Easy Pieces - Easy Rider\n\n\n... but when I list those it's not because of plot similarities (though there are some) or style (although I think you can definitely see the influence of some great films) - it's again because of the heart of it. I heard a few people at the screening comment that the film was "too long" but I don't agree. I think exploring a journey of this magnitude required visiting all of the people he touched and taking the time to see the land.\n\nHal Holbrook was just perfect, as was the cast as a whole, and I think Emile Hirsch is really going places - he was fantastic and he owned the role. Eddie Vedder's music worked perfectly as well - not distracting or quirky - just a part of the whole.\n\nThe film received a standing ovation and quite a few tears were shed. Magic.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":596146,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-10-19","keywords":"wilderness,alaska,journey,following a dream,self discovery","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Into The Wild","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1051656473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTViZjU2OTUtOWQwNS00NGY3LTljMjMtZjZjZDgxYmE1MGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTViZjU2OTUtOWQwNS00NGY3LTljMjMtZjZjZDgxYmE1MGFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Vantage","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0386472/","name":"Emile Hirsch","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000681/","name":"Vince Vaughn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001416/","name":"Catherine Keener"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079747/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177217/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000576/","name":"Sean Penn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1040556/","name":"Jon Krakauer"],"duration":"PT2H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The plot. When I saw that 27% of the people gave this movie a 10 rating, I wondered if I was the slow one. Then I read the reviews.\n\nWhen most of the stars started appearing on talk shows, trying to convey the buddy buddy tomfoolery that went on behind the scenes, I kind of sensed that damage control was underway. There was a moment in this movie where a few of the actors were sitting at a table talking complete gibberish, and it was later joked that they pulled a "lost in translation". I guess the joke was on me the viewer.\n\nWhat rolled along as a pretty good movie slowly gathering steam, stalled into chaotic incomprehensive mess. If you loved the first movie because it developed into a brilliantly masterminded theft with many twists, you be left with the empty feeling that the only thing that was lifted in this movie; was your money for the admission ticket.\n\nIt is too late for me now, but you still have a chance.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":373536,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-12-15","keywords":"heist,sequel,pretending to be pregnant,father daughter relationship,reference to spongebob squarepants","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Twelve","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1989804313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxNzQ0NjAtNmI0MS00NzQ5LTkxNzItMjExMWU0M2Q0MTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxNzQ0NjAtNmI0MS00NzQ5LTkxNzItMjExMWU0M2Q0MTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024560/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1079776/","name":"George Nolfi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751207/","name":"Jack Golden Russell"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The plot. When I saw that 27% of the people gave this movie a 10 rating, I wondered if I was the slow one. Then I read the reviews.\n\nWhen most of the stars started appearing on talk shows, trying to convey the buddy buddy tomfoolery that went on behind the scenes, I kind of sensed that damage control was underway. There was a moment in this movie where a few of the actors were sitting at a table talking complete gibberish, and it was later joked that they pulled a "lost in translation". I guess the joke was on me the viewer.\n\nWhat rolled along as a pretty good movie slowly gathering steam, stalled into chaotic incomprehensive mess. If you loved the first movie because it developed into a brilliantly masterminded theft with many twists, you be left with the empty feeling that the only thing that was lifted in this movie; was your money for the admission ticket.\n\nIt is too late for me now, but you still have a chance.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":373536,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-12-15","keywords":"heist,sequel,pretending to be pregnant,father daughter relationship,reference to spongebob squarepants","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Twelve","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1989804313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxNzQ0NjAtNmI0MS00NzQ5LTkxNzItMjExMWU0M2Q0MTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxNzQ0NjAtNmI0MS00NzQ5LTkxNzItMjExMWU0M2Q0MTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024560/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1079776/","name":"George Nolfi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751207/","name":"Jack Golden Russell"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Yes, seven. No, I'm not talking about the David Fincher directed thriller, nor am I referring to Samurai, Dwarfs or the lucky number. In this context, seven denotes the number of wince inducing minutes it takes for Lakeview Terrace to throw it all away.\n\nParticular genres of movies tend to have a nasty propensity to ruin their final acts, the foremost of those being thrillers and horror films. May it be an amateur director not knowing how to complete their vision, studio intervention sucking the life from the screen or the commonly occurring revelatory "shocker" ending which tries to jam too many ideas in the viewer's already bleeding sockets. Oddly, director Neil LaBute's latest offering does not succumb to a conventional destructive timeline, but instead opts to cataclysmically implode in literally the final scenes, a feat which few films can boast. Perhaps I am being an iota harsh, as I am recommending this film and the majority of this review will be skewed favourably, but chiefly, my unbounded feelings of contempt towards the finale should stand as a testament to their standalone absurdity which contrasts harshly with the preceding 90 or so minutes.\n\nSamuel L. Jackson has had a vibrant career portraying characters in two spectrums of the acting realm. On one side we have his depictions that can be lumped into the loud-mouthed anti-hero category (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard with a Vengeance, Snakes on a Plane), and on the other, his more nuanced (as nuanced as Sam Jackson can be) roles. (Black Snake Moan, Resurrecting the Champ, Coach Carter) Lakeview Terrace to some extent blurs this boundary, but for the most part Jackson plays his role straight, and he is very good because of it. Jackson plays Abel Turner a veteran, but widowed LAPD officer who lives his daughter Celia (Regine Nehy) and Son Marcus (Jaishon Fisher) on Lakeview Terrace in the hills. He is strict to be sure and his protective nature sometimes obscures the obvious affection for his children. It is touches like this, and similar additions by LaBute that makes his character all the more menacing when the tension later builds, as he is not so much a faceless villain, but a deeply flawed everyman. Despite an encroaching wildfire, things are routine on Lakeview; Abel patrols the neighbourhood at night, loves his job and wants nothing more then to protect his family. Things change however when a new couple move in next door. The fact that husband Chris (Patrick Wilson) wife Lisa (Keri Washington) are interracial is only the fuel for Abel's contempt, and when his children witness a late-night skinny dip by these two newlyweds, the fire erupts and Abel and Chris' lives spiral out of control.\n\nFashioning Abel as a cop is an intelligent choice, as per the television advertisements indicate, what are they going to do, and who are the authorities going to believe; who will police the police indeed. The tension for the duration is so high, you don't even need a knife to cut it, and a definite sense of dread and menace perforates the narrative. LaBute, truthfully, makes few mistakes, he allows for character development, and as I mentioned not just regarding Chris and Lisa, lets the story develop at a slow burning pace, with the hillside fires mirroring the escalating tempers. The story is also far more insightful and caring then I ever would have anticipated regarding the complicated issue of race and marriage, without feeling shoehorned into the thriller template. As you can clearly discern I have a fairly large amount of admiration for Lakeview Terrace, which brings me to the ending.\n\nFew endings I have seen have represented such a radical shift in tone, and made its characters undertake such ridiculous and uncharacteristic actions then we see here; and I assure you it is jarring. The immediately preceding act, is an iota off kilter with the acts preceding, but does not draw attention and properly illustrates the consequences when things are taken too far in the name of retribution. I was fully under the impression that things were going to end sharply until Abel's character jolts erratically from intelligent saboteur to volcanic lunatic and makes a series of choices that are against both his nature, and what the audience would want to see transpire. Either Abel lost his mind, or the director did. Those who seek out this film in theatres may be disappointed and feel the conclusion somehow managed to bilk them out of their cash like a sneaky pickpocket. LaBute's finale does not so much embody a slap in the face, but a swift hard kick to the groin.\n\nRead all my reviews at Simon Says Movies: http://simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":50647,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-11-19","keywords":"interracial couple,neighbor,suburb,double standard,suburbia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lakeview Terrace: Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3043295257","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMDc3NjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgyMDc3NjMyNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxNTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Samuel L.

Still, stay away, far away, from this film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-10-01","keywords":"profanity in title,title appears in writing,tattoo on chest,father daughter relationship,terminal illness","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5321052/","name":"Sinje Irslinger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4056269/","name":"Max Hubacher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001709/","name":"Til Schweiger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1839743/","name":"André Erkau"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0183929/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049524/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010760/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1452691/","name":"Thomas Vass","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457776/","name":"Katja Kittendorf","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10422371/","name":"Frank Pape"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The harrowing situation itself is stupefying; the stunning visuals, the incredible acting, and the powerful background score just add to the horror. In this era of 3D movies, this is one of the few movies where the 3D effect actually contributes something to the storytelling aspect, as well as the gripping reality of the film.

The well-timed bouts of humour by George Clooney's supporting character, the veteran astronaut Mathew Kowalsky, give us the only comic relief in an otherwise gloomy suspense thriller.

The mesmerizingly-orchestrated meteoric-shower-like scene of the entering spacecraft, towards the end of the movie, is one of the best executed scenes of cinematic history!\n\nWhether you're a fan of science-fiction thrillers or not, whether you're a fan of 3D films or not, (to quote the lead characters from the movie) either way, it's gonna be one hell of a ride!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":793049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,despair","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For the last decade or so his focus has been on more realistic period dramas and character pieces. His attempts at grand action spectacle (the underrated Tintin aside) were underwhelming. But who knew he had this left in him?\n\nThis film is an absolute blast. It seamlessly combines reality and animation into one big, exciting adventure. I'm still not completely sure how it pulled it off. I was absolutely amazed at how seamlessly the film merged animation with reality (I'd say only perhaps 1/3 of the film takes place in the "real" world) and gave the obviously digital environments emotional and kinetic weight. That's a very hard balance to pull off and this movie doesn't even raise a sweat. In fact, some of the best scenes revolve around the absurd mix of online and real existence. Pretty much every scene in Sorrento's soulless corporate HQ is a riot because of the seriousness with which they take their involvement in this silly online world, made even more ridiculous by the motions they all make in their VR suits as they react to unseen perils like well-dressed mimes.\n\nI have no doubt that this film will receive a lot of flak for its reliance on pop culture artifacts. And there's some truth to the criticism. The best scene in the movie is when one of the characters waits in an almost meditative trance during the fight scene until he cries out "form of a gundam" in Japanese and awesomeness ensues. Would this scene work as well if it hadn't been a recognizable brand? No question it wouldn't. And that goes for an infinite array of references, from the Iron Giant to the Delorean to an absolutely perfect Overlook Hotel to Chucky ("Oh God, it's f*%@ing Chucky" has got to be the second greatest line in the movie).\n\nBut to say that this is nothing but leaching off others' success is unfair. The references are there for a reason. This is a Geek movie, and for geeks this sort of referencing is how they approach the universe. It'd seem odd if there were no open pop culture references in a free-for-all online world. More to the point, the film has a lot to say about online culture and the isolating effect it has on people. The film isn't all pretty colors and film references, it deals with issues like how real the connections we form online actually are, the ever-decreasing distance between fantasy and reality, the importance of community involvement, and all sorts of identity issues that arise when we can hide behind avatars. Not that I'd call the film overly deep or anything, but it's certainly more than just a collection of pop culture references thrown together with minimal plot.\n\nThe characters are all good fun. Parzival and his mate Aech are just like a lot of friends I know online, although Parzival's shallowness gives him a good obstacle to overcome. Art3mis is a bit more driven and has goals that take her further than just being the best at a video game. Parzival has a major cyber-crush on her, which is something of a problem. Daito and Shoto are somewhat more distant online rivals. All of them have great moments, but most come after their true selves get revealed around 2/3 of the way through the film. Some of them are very surprising (don't look at the cast list) and they are all funny together. Krennic's director Sorrento is a great villain. He's so full of himself and contemptuous that his appearance in-game as a muscular brute in a business suit dealing with mystical things he cares nothing about is a blast. And when he's cornered he can be hilariously practical. His online minion i-R0k is also priceless, the sort of super badass dude living in his mom's basement that you can only find in video games. Mark Rylance steals every scene he's in as the vaguely Wozniakian creator of the game. He's a rather sad figure, one who could never handle reality with such aplomb as he does the world he designed. I was surprsed to see Simon Pegg as his co-founder, a somewhat wasted role but nicel different from his more usual fare. \n\n And I really really didn't think Spielberg could pull this off. It's hard to write a love letter to your favorite films when you're the creator rather than consumer. I'd have been more comfortable with some younger director who grew up on these films. I mean, his works aside I can't recall Spielberg ever displaying much interest in video games or Japanese pop culture (post-Kurosawa at least). Yet this film depends on its immense love of such elements. Perhaps a lot of it comes from the screenplay by the novel's author and Kal Penn, two people eminently qualified to pull this off. But it could never have succeeded without the passion of the maestro himself, and succeed it does. I went in with low expectations and had an absolute blast. But more importantly: I understood that reference.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":399334,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-03-29","keywords":"player,based on novel,screenplay adapted by author,virtual reality,dystopia","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Dreamer" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2568140825","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTgzMDcwZDctOWNiZC00OTk4LWIzY2QtOTNmODJkZDViNjM3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Save the OASIS, save the world.

The film shows him to be a blockhead who can put the camera sometimes in the right place.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":591648,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-11-21","keywords":"iran,hostage,u.s. embassy,escape,american embassy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winner: Best Picture","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1537319449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As the Iranian revolution reaches a boiling point, a CIA 'exfiltration' specialist concocts a risky plan to free six Americans who have found shelter at the home of the Canadian ambassador.

So many missed opportunities in a film about one of the most spectacular and complex battles of WWII. I can see what Nolan tried to do here, a kind of British "Thin Red Line" (there's even wind in the grass, lol, i kid you not), but he failed spectacularly. There are no memorable characters to be found here, and one wonders even if there are any actual characters at all. Not one, not one of them has any semblance of a character arc. Not one. Again, I see how Nolan tried to convey the impersonality of war and insignificance of the individual but he did it with such a heavy, clumsy hand, providing us with no counterpoint with which to drive the point home. It's basic screen writing stuff really. I'd expect such ineptitude from a first year film student but not from a supposed "master of the craft".\n\nBut anyways, this could have been forgivable if the film was more about the event itself, but it fails at that too. After watching the film, you'd be given to believe that the Battle of Dunkirk was fought by three Spitfires (100 were lost over the beeches alone), 1 German heinkel, a couple of stukas, 2 destroyers or a dozen or so boats... Oh yes and maybe a few hundred men standing quietly on a beach, doing nothing except desperately trying to look morose and dejected in a faintly passive-aggressive way. It's ridiculous. We are talking about total and absolute chaos happening there, hundreds of thousands of rifles alone discarded on the beach, not to mention guns, artillery, trucks... Burning and sinking ships of all sizes all across the horizon, parts of beaches inaccessible from rotting corpses washing up with tides. This was actually way bigger than D-Day landings in terms of men and equipment stuffed in a very small patch of land. Half a million desperate men stuffed in a small town, bombarded incessantly and under constant attack from bombers. Where did all those people defecate, what did they eat ffs? I wanted to know that, really. That at least would have given some much needed humanity to the so-called-characters Nolan keeps yanking around like so much puppets. So many missed opportunities there...\n\nIf Nolan wanted to do a tight little film about isolation and desperation of being on the loosing side of the war, he had plenty of other places and battles to choose from. Just ask around. Or if he simply had to insist on Dunkirk, then we should have seen this total chaos all around our protagonists, in the background at least - that would have served as a really powerful, so desperately needed counterpoint to the individual suffering and heroism.\n\nAnd this brings me to the final point. The movie is one tone only. A monotone repetition of sights and emotions we've seen and experienced before. No one cracks a joke. No one really breaks down. No one has an embarrassing moment. There are no ups and downs, it's just some morose faceless robots performing obvious actions leading towards a bleedingly obvious goal. One single emotional and narrative tone from the beginning to the end. The entire emotional and narrative content of the movie would have fit snugly into a 20 minute short, and that is pretty much how long it takes before you start yawning. The best thing that can be said about the movie is that individual scenes are well directed and worth experiencing. But that is the real problem here - the film is constructed as a series of impressive "experiences" rather than cohesive piece of drama (And this particular historical event is almost uniquely stuffed with dramatic opportunities. It's almost as if golden-age Hollywood writers wrote the script for the actual event.) In other words, it's a Dunkirk theme park rather than a movie. You take rides. And that's it. And even those become repetitive after a while.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":598445,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-07-19","keywords":"world war two,1940s,soldier,beach,evacuation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3402283289","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2VhMGY3YWQtMGYwZC00ZmM5LTg2MzgtZGRlNWQ2MGE2MTNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM4OTI2MTU@._V1_.jpg","description":"Allied soldiers from Belgium, the British Empire and France are surrounded by the German army and evacuated during a fierce battle in World War II."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7887725/","name":"Fionn Whitehead"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4422686/","name":"Barry Keoghan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0240550/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The vacationers include the Mossbacher family - Nicole (Connie Britton), a successful type-A exec, who can't help but treat her family like disobedient employees; her husband, Mark (Steve Zahn), dealing with both an embarrassing health crisis and a terminal inferiority complex; their teenaged son, Quinn (Fred Hechinger), a socially awkward gamer, experiencing the wonder of nature for the very first time; their daughter, Olivia (Sydney Sweeney), and her friend, Paula (Brittany O'Grady), sharp-tongued college sophomores who cast a sardonic eye on the lifestyles and belief systems of everyone around them.  The handsome, entitled Shane Patton (Jake Lacy) is here with his beautiful bride, Rachel (Alexandra Daddario).  Shane and Rachel are in the throes of young love, but as they get to know each other better in this new, intimate environment, clouds of doubt appear - and by the time Shane's intrusive mother, Kitty (Molly Shannon) surprises them with an unwelcome visit, their fairytale honeymoon has begun to unravel. And finally, there is Tanya McQuoid (Jennifer Coolidge), a wealthy, unstable woman, recovering from the death of her mother, traveling alone to the hotel, looking for love and in desperate need of a massage."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The film, that closed the New York Film Festival, is simply one of the best films of the year.\n\nFlight tells the story of Whip Whitaker, an airline pilot that saves a plane and nearly all its passengers from a certain death. When an investigation is carried out to look into the details of the crash, Whip's troubling lifestyle begins to surface. Writer John Latins creates a dynamic and an internal narrative confrontation for viewers to become immersed in a story full of mental struggle. It's a unique and very engaging story that stands as one of season's best efforts.\n\nDenzel Washington, and not to be taken lightly, is fully in the zone and portrays one of his finest screen moments in years. I haven't been this impressed with his abilities as an actor since The Hurricane (1999). He lands solidly in Whip, giving us his natural aggression, charisma, and flaws. Allowing us to travel with Whip on this journey, Mr. Washington proves once and for all, he is one of the great treasures of American cinema. Denzel gives an access root into the character for all intended purposes, a clear understanding of the inner resistance that will not only plague Whip, but the movie audience as well.\n\nThe story doesn't seem like an obvious choice for Robert Zemeckis, who has excelled in genres that have provided masterpieces like Forrest Gump (1994) and Cast Away (2000). As the film provides a more dark and jagged approach in his directorial style, Zemeckis executes with precision. It's a satisfactory effort from the director who makes his return to live action after a long string of motion-capture efforts. Assisting Washington's bravura performance is Oscar-nominee Don Cheadle, who teamed up with Denzel in the 90's classic film, Devil in a Blue Dress (1995). As the wise-cracking lawyer, whose own moral values may be tested in exchange for corporate and criminal immunity, Cheadle is a relieved presence. In a comedic and near-brilliant performance, John Goodman steals Flight from every actor including Washington in his short, two-scene appearances. Goodman continues to show an effortless range, even in poor film choices, and a confidence that makes him one of the great character actors working today. It's a performance that Oscar should consider on multiple levels. In a heartbreaking turn, Kelly Reilly as the drug-addicted Nicole, provides an emotional epicenter and boundary that stands as one of Latins' great writing achievements. Reilly is simply marvelous.\n\nContinuing to beef up their acting resume, the great Bruce Greenwood shines while Brian Geraghty continues to prove he is one of Hollywood's best kept secrets.\n\nComposer Alan Silvestri orchestrates an outstanding score that is both melodic and soothing. Cinematographer Don Burgess, once-nominated for Forrest Gump, gives clean, fresh camera lenses look into a shockingly dirty and gritty story. Zemeckis' handle of the astounding opening scenes, especially the plane crash, is one of the best visual and nail- biting moments of the year. Its Zemeckis at his best!\n\nFlight is not only one of the best cinematic efforts of the New York Film Festival; it stands as a great surprise and entry into the 2012 Oscar season. Denzel Washington is completely Oscar-bound but the buck shouldn't stop there; a deserved consideration campaign should be given to John Goodman and Kelly Reilly along with screenwriter John Latins. Flight is a home-run!\n\nRead More Reviews at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":338803,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-12-12","keywords":"stewardess,pilot,airplane crash,airplane pilot,flight attendant","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2384176153","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NjAzNTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ2MTA2OA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NjAzNTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ2MTA2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An airline pilot saves a flight from crashing, but an investigation into the malfunctions reveals something troubling.

When an investigation is carried out to look into the details of the crash, Whip's troubling lifestyle begins to surface. Writer John Latins creates a dynamic and an internal narrative confrontation for viewers to become immersed in a story full of mental struggle. It's a unique and very engaging story that stands as one of season's best efforts.\n\nDenzel Washington, and not to be taken lightly, is fully in the zone and portrays one of his finest screen moments in years. I haven't been this impressed with his abilities as an actor since The Hurricane (1999). He lands solidly in Whip, giving us his natural aggression, charisma, and flaws. Allowing us to travel with Whip on this journey, Mr. Washington proves once and for all, he is one of the great treasures of American cinema. Denzel gives an access root into the character for all intended purposes, a clear understanding of the inner resistance that will not only plague Whip, but the movie audience as well.\n\nThe story doesn't seem like an obvious choice for Robert Zemeckis, who has excelled in genres that have provided masterpieces like Forrest Gump (1994) and Cast Away (2000). As the film provides a more dark and jagged approach in his directorial style, Zemeckis executes with precision. It's a satisfactory effort from the director who makes his return to live action after a long string of motion-capture efforts. Assisting Washington's bravura performance is Oscar-nominee Don Cheadle, who teamed up with Denzel in the 90's classic film, Devil in a Blue Dress (1995). As the wise-cracking lawyer, whose own moral values may be tested in exchange for corporate and criminal immunity, Cheadle is a relieved presence. In a comedic and near-brilliant performance, John Goodman steals Flight from every actor including Washington in his short, two-scene appearances. Goodman continues to show an effortless range, even in poor film choices, and a confidence that makes him one of the great character actors working today. It's a performance that Oscar should consider on multiple levels. In a heartbreaking turn, Kelly Reilly as the drug-addicted Nicole, provides an emotional epicenter and boundary that stands as one of Latins' great writing achievements. Reilly is simply marvelous.\n\nContinuing to beef up their acting resume, the great Bruce Greenwood shines while Brian Geraghty continues to prove he is one of Hollywood's best kept secrets.\n\nComposer Alan Silvestri orchestrates an outstanding score that is both melodic and soothing. Cinematographer Don Burgess, once-nominated for Forrest Gump, gives clean, fresh camera lenses look into a shockingly dirty and gritty story. Zemeckis' handle of the astounding opening scenes, especially the plane crash, is one of the best visual and nail- biting moments of the year. Its Zemeckis at his best!\n\nFlight is not only one of the best cinematic efforts of the New York Film Festival; it stands as a great surprise and entry into the 2012 Oscar season. Denzel Washington is completely Oscar-bound but the buck shouldn't stop there; a deserved consideration campaign should be given to John Goodman and Kelly Reilly along with screenwriter John Latins. Flight is a home-run!\n\nRead More Reviews at The Awards Circuit (http://www.awardscircuit.com)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":338803,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-12-12","keywords":"stewardess,pilot,airplane crash,airplane pilot,flight attendant","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2384176153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NjAzNTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ2MTA2OA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0NjAzNTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTQ2MTA2OA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An airline pilot saves a flight from crashing, but an investigation into the malfunctions reveals something troubling.

Daniel Craig is superb as James Bond and parting from that point everything in it is enjoyable, frightening, thrilling just because we're with him. He conquered us from the word go. The initial chase is one of the best in film history and as soon as we get to know this new incarnation of the iconic Ian Fleming character, we're hooked. He's virile but there is room for ambiguity. He's elegant but as, the sensational Eva Green, points out is more acquired than inherited. More working class than even Sean Connery and that works wonders for Mr Bond.

Daniel Craig is superb as James Bond and parting from that point everything in it is enjoyable, frightening, thrilling just because we're with him. He conquered us from the word go. The initial chase is one of the best in film history and as soon as we get to know this new incarnation of the iconic Ian Fleming character, we're hooked. He's virile but there is room for ambiguity. He's elegant but as, the sensational Eva Green, points out is more acquired than inherited. More working class than even Sean Connery and that works wonders for Mr Bond. The script is more compact and organic. The locations are breathtaking and what else I can say?

The questions of the hundreds of millions potentially transferred to London accounts for the benefit of Madoff relatives is not explored. The ineptitude of the SEC, FINRA and other agencies is also given short-shrift.

They met in 2003 when he was performing an examination as to whether Madoff was running a Ponzi scheme. The SEC Director of Compliance Investigations and Examinations attended their wedding in 2007. \n\nAs it is, the movie dips its toe into the $64.8B (yes $64.8 billion) fraud case and provides some insights as to who in the inner circle may or may not have been culpable– all in the course largely telling a family drama.

It combines combines the classic dystopic sci-fi future with a scorched Earth, a few heroes struggling against enigmatic aliens and a corrupt military force, action style sequences that are at times quite intense, and the typical slow-paced Asian movie storytelling. Add to this a rich amount of influences from the FF games, including eight mysterious spirits that must be found in time or the heroine will succumb, as well as a lot of mythological references that must be taken for granted rather than analysed to bits if the viewer is to find any pleasure in this film.\n\nThe trouble is that the FF video game fans wanted a story based on the games, or on their particular favourite in the series, and were disappointed with both the story, the setting and the characters. The average sci-fi movie fan, though, who ought to have loved the wicked general (excellently voice-cast by James Woods) and his huge space cannon, as well as the 'Aliens' styled surroundings and technology, was put off by all the talk about spirits and world souls. Leaving for a few of us who went to see the film with no real expectations, to enjoy it.\n\nBecause it is a good film. The animation is, for the most part, excellent, even if some scenes have a too blatant 'look what we can do' boast to them. Particularly all the scenes of Aki's hair waving in the wind. Personally, I didn't think the story was either too slow-paced, nor too weird. It works well, especially if you like Asian movies. For the European and American market, though, there's probably not enough action and too much talking.\n\nIf this movie had been released this year, it would probably have been given a better reception. The thought of fully computer animated films isn't as new and strange anymore, and with films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Ring and Hero, the west is opening up for the Asian way of telling stories. I hope to see more films like this, at least if they are this well made. 9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":81158,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2001-10-31","keywords":"based on video game,motion capture,profanity,weapons fire,movie flop","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi715587865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q4NmRlYmItYTA1Yy00MjI0LTliODktY2UzMWU4OTg4MDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q4NmRlYmItYTA1Yy00MjI0LTliODktY2UzMWU4OTg4MDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Columbia Tristar"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000114/","name":"Steve Buscemi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001840/","name":"Ming-Na Wen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0756983/","name":"Hironobu Sakaguchi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012102/","name":"Motonori Sakakibara"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012408/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035851/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040831/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0756983/","name":"Hironobu Sakaguchi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718031/","name":"Al Reinert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0899113/","name":"Jeff Vintar"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It combines combines the classic dystopic sci-fi future with a scorched Earth, a few heroes struggling against enigmatic aliens and a corrupt military force, action style sequences that are at times quite intense, and the typical slow-paced Asian movie storytelling. Add to this a rich amount of influences from the FF games, including eight mysterious spirits that must be found in time or the heroine will succumb, as well as a lot of mythological references that must be taken for granted rather than analysed to bits if the viewer is to find any pleasure in this film.\n\nThe trouble is that the FF video game fans wanted a story based on the games, or on their particular favourite in the series, and were disappointed with both the story, the setting and the characters. The average sci-fi movie fan, though, who ought to have loved the wicked general (excellently voice-cast by James Woods) and his huge space cannon, as well as the 'Aliens' styled surroundings and technology, was put off by all the talk about spirits and world souls. Leaving for a few of us who went to see the film with no real expectations, to enjoy it.\n\nBecause it is a good film. The animation is, for the most part, excellent, even if some scenes have a too blatant 'look what we can do' boast to them. Particularly all the scenes of Aki's hair waving in the wind. Personally, I didn't think the story was either too slow-paced, nor too weird. It works well, especially if you like Asian movies. For the European and American market, though, there's probably not enough action and too much talking.\n\nIf this movie had been released this year, it would probably have been given a better reception. The thought of fully computer animated films isn't as new and strange anymore, and with films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, The Ring and Hero, the west is opening up for the Asian way of telling stories. I hope to see more films like this, at least if they are this well made. 9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":81158,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2001-10-31","keywords":"based on video game,motion capture,profanity,weapons fire,movie flop","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi715587865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q4NmRlYmItYTA1Yy00MjI0LTliODktY2UzMWU4OTg4MDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q4NmRlYmItYTA1Yy00MjI0LTliODktY2UzMWU4OTg4MDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Columbia Tristar","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000114/","name":"Steve Buscemi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001840/","name":"Ming-Na Wen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0756983/","name":"Hironobu Sakaguchi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012102/","name":"Motonori Sakakibara"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012408/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035851/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040831/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0756983/","name":"Hironobu Sakaguchi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718031/","name":"Al Reinert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0899113/","name":"Jeff Vintar"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

One discrepancy against it's classification as a stoner comedy however lies in that even if you're not high yourself; even if you've never even been high in your life, there's still lots of fun to be had here as the jokes are broad enough in their design to apply to any ridiculous situation. So while the plant obviously makes a starring role here, the focus is not primarily on it, and the movie is better off as a result.\n\nSo far this year we have been treated to an unusually high dosage of stoner comedies, with Pineapple Express being a late third behind the too-dumb-for-it's-own-good Strange Wilderness and the dumb-but-fun Harold &amp; Kumar. However, despite coming in late to the game, the old expression of "saving the best 'till last" seems applicable here. Where previous instalments from this year combined the dumb with surreal through incoherent situations obviously dreamt up from people who were under the influence at the time, Pineapple Express feels silly, but not the extent where the entire feature boils down to caricature comedy. Here the writers take two characters, start them off one place and take them on an adventure not just through crime, car-chases, comical fight scenes and little personal squabbles, but through themselves. It's a combination which could have had a disastrously polarising effect, but the writers get it spot on here.\n\nMain characters Dale Denton (Seth Rogan) and Saul Silver (James Franco) may have alliterative names akin to comic book heroes, but they're certainly not of that kind. Instead, they deal with drugs; Saul is Dale's supplier, and as much as Saul would like to think of Dale as a buddy, Dale wants nothing else to do with him outside of the service he provides. However, after Dale witnesses a murder involving some drug-dealer crimelords, the two are forced to embark on a journey that will have them at odds with each other whether they like it or not. What results of this is a story of friendship, and while the unlikely premise of these guys not exactly getting along does seem a bit shifty, the chemistry between Rogan and Franco is superb enough to allow their characters plenty of growing. To be sure, this isn't a hallmark drama, there are no grandeur statements and no tears are provoked from director David Gordon Green but that's what makes it lovable; it's a story about two regular guys, who get into crazy shenanigans, smoke weed and crack some jokes. It's not enlightening per se, but it's entertaining, and down to earth.\n\nThis is where Pineapple Express begins to take the lead in front of its predecessors, as it actually attempts to tell a compelling story with an undoubtedly overblown amount of action, but with grounded drama to bear the weight of its fabrications. Through this fusion of solid characterisation with a ridiculous but conceivable action-packed plot, the film succeeds in creating an engagingly entertaining experience that doesn't just provide excitement and memorable characters, but also manages to tickle the funny bone just as frequently.\n\nComing from the three guys who last year blessed the screen with the hilarious Superbad, Pineapple Express is a riot start to finish, combining lots of blunt dialogue with slapstick and farce to great effect in ways which made the aforementioned creation as funny as it was. It has to be said that this time around, the pacing isn't quite as tight, and the script's insistence on some scenes' ability to sustain laughter is a little off, and this in turn leads to the movie's only real technical fault. In such moments, jokes will be drawn out for long stretches of time, losing momentum, yet thankfully such scenes are far and few between, and with the pace heightening the more film reaches the conclusion; the frequency sharply decreases with time. Nevertheless, if you don't mind profane dialogue, blunt jokes and plenty of passive violence used mainly for comic effect, then Pineapple Express should please any desire for laughter that you may have.\n\nAnd that's all it basically comes down to, but what else were you expecting?

One discrepancy against it's classification as a stoner comedy however lies in that even if you're not high yourself; even if you've never even been high in your life, there's still lots of fun to be had here as the jokes are broad enough in their design to apply to any ridiculous situation. So while the plant obviously makes a starring role here, the focus is not primarily on it, and the movie is better off as a result.\n\nSo far this year we have been treated to an unusually high dosage of stoner comedies, with Pineapple Express being a late third behind the too-dumb-for-it's-own-good Strange Wilderness and the dumb-but-fun Harold &amp; Kumar. However, despite coming in late to the game, the old expression of "saving the best 'till last" seems applicable here. Where previous instalments from this year combined the dumb with surreal through incoherent situations obviously dreamt up from people who were under the influence at the time, Pineapple Express feels silly, but not the extent where the entire feature boils down to caricature comedy. Here the writers take two characters, start them off one place and take them on an adventure not just through crime, car-chases, comical fight scenes and little personal squabbles, but through themselves. It's a combination which could have had a disastrously polarising effect, but the writers get it spot on here.\n\nMain characters Dale Denton (Seth Rogan) and Saul Silver (James Franco) may have alliterative names akin to comic book heroes, but they're certainly not of that kind. Instead, they deal with drugs; Saul is Dale's supplier, and as much as Saul would like to think of Dale as a buddy, Dale wants nothing else to do with him outside of the service he provides. However, after Dale witnesses a murder involving some drug-dealer crimelords, the two are forced to embark on a journey that will have them at odds with each other whether they like it or not. What results of this is a story of friendship, and while the unlikely premise of these guys not exactly getting along does seem a bit shifty, the chemistry between Rogan and Franco is superb enough to allow their characters plenty of growing. To be sure, this isn't a hallmark drama, there are no grandeur statements and no tears are provoked from director David Gordon Green but that's what makes it lovable; it's a story about two regular guys, who get into crazy shenanigans, smoke weed and crack some jokes. It's not enlightening per se, but it's entertaining, and down to earth.\n\nThis is where Pineapple Express begins to take the lead in front of its predecessors, as it actually attempts to tell a compelling story with an undoubtedly overblown amount of action, but with grounded drama to bear the weight of its fabrications. Through this fusion of solid characterisation with a ridiculous but conceivable action-packed plot, the film succeeds in creating an engagingly entertaining experience that doesn't just provide excitement and memorable characters, but also manages to tickle the funny bone just as frequently.\n\nComing from the three guys who last year blessed the screen with the hilarious Superbad, Pineapple Express is a riot start to finish, combining lots of blunt dialogue with slapstick and farce to great effect in ways which made the aforementioned creation as funny as it was. It has to be said that this time around, the pacing isn't quite as tight, and the script's insistence on some scenes' ability to sustain laughter is a little off, and this in turn leads to the movie's only real technical fault. In such moments, jokes will be drawn out for long stretches of time, losing momentum, yet thankfully such scenes are far and few between, and with the pace heightening the more film reaches the conclusion; the frequency sharply decreases with time. Nevertheless, if you don't mind profane dialogue, blunt jokes and plenty of passive violence used mainly for comic effect, then Pineapple Express should please any desire for laughter that you may have.\n\nAnd that's all it basically comes down to, but what else were you expecting? As a movie, Pineaple Express is an entertaining and at times sweet take on friendship based around two very down to earth characters that most people should be able to relate to in some way or another. As a duo, Rogan and Franco are extremely well matched, with the interplay between the two coming off as naturally comical and aptly delivered to the point of satisfying the movie's biggest pulling point and focus.

You can hear the thud and almost feel the pain as heavily muscled male bodies pound each other. It's almost like a ritual. John DuPont, billionaire and unbalanced eccentric, offers a talented young wrestler the kind of sponsorship that one can only dream of. Why then does Mark Schultz, ensconced in a luxurious guest house with a state-of-the-art training facility, feel so uneasy? Mr. DuPont, played by Steve Carell as you've never seen him before, has some disquieting qualities. I can't avoid thinking that if the characters in this movie, and men in general, had been more articulate about their feelings, a tragedy could have been avoided, but that is irrelevant. The ending of this movie, based on a true story, was in the headlines some years back. If you don't remember what happened, I won't spoil it for you.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138723,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-01-16","keywords":"domination,binging on junk food,wrestler,pennsylvania,upper class","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi230469145","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Foxcatcher tells the fascinating true story of corruption and the struggle for power between Olympic gold medal-winning brothers and an eccentric millionaire."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587955/","name":"Bennett Miller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323215/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0754971/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190175/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296861/","name":"E.

You can hear the thud and almost feel the pain as heavily muscled male bodies pound each other. It's almost like a ritual. John DuPont, billionaire and unbalanced eccentric, offers a talented young wrestler the kind of sponsorship that one can only dream of. Why then does Mark Schultz, ensconced in a luxurious guest house with a state-of-the-art training facility, feel so uneasy? Mr. DuPont, played by Steve Carell as you've never seen him before, has some disquieting qualities. I can't avoid thinking that if the characters in this movie, and men in general, had been more articulate about their feelings, a tragedy could have been avoided, but that is irrelevant. The ending of this movie, based on a true story, was in the headlines some years back. If you don't remember what happened, I won't spoil it for you.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":138723,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-01-16","keywords":"domination,binging on junk food,wrestler,pennsylvania,upper class","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi230469145","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk2MjA3ODM1OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDc2NTY2MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Foxcatcher tells the fascinating true story of corruption and the struggle for power between Olympic gold medal-winning brothers and an eccentric millionaire.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0749263/","name":"Mark Ruffalo"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0587955/","name":"Bennett Miller"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323215/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0754971/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190175/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0296861/","name":"E.

Each tale relies so heavily on those that came before or after that one can never be a truly all-encompassing work. Sure, the three-act structure can be utilized, but without the background info, nor the knowledge that more will be coming, watching a middle installment alone will leave you confused and disorientated. The reason I bring this up is the fact that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is good enough to warrant the praise and to put the idea in my head about whether to call it a masterpiece. The tone is perfect, the laughs are many, the darkness is charcoal black—how could this be the same director as the abysmal—in comparison to the rest of the series—Order of the Phoenix, David Yates? Two words   Bruno Delbonnel.\n\nWho is Delbonnel you may ask? Well, he is the brilliant cinematographer behind the camera. I may have blamed the failures of the fifth film on its screenplay as Steve Kloves was glaringly absent, (he being the writer of each other film, including this new one), but a film is a team effort. Therefore I guess maybe I shouldn't put all the accolades on one man now; I just feel absolutely compelled to do so because so many moments linger in my mind due to the beauty of their composition and use of their environments to stay interesting and exciting at all times. Visually, you cannot be bored. It just goes to show that it is never the director alone, but also the team he or she brings along. I like Yates and was surprised at how much I disliked his first foray in the Potter universe, granted, I felt the book itself was sub-par at best. Thankfully, he did not disappoint with his second of three, (make that four as book seven goes to a two-part finale), because, as it was with the novels, Half-Blood Prince is by far the best of the series—until Deathly Hallows of course. And adding the pedigree of a guy like Delbonnel, with films such as Across the Universe, A Very Long Engagement, and Amelie in his back pocket—all stunning works of art—only makes his job easier.\n\nI can't get over the use of close-ups throughout, or the multiple instances of framing used to hide something on screen. Oftentimes, the camera pans or cuts to reveal something in the fringes, to highlight the focal point when it's not centrally located, or literally move our eyes to exactly where the filmmakers want them to be. The blocking is superb with some scenes blurring the edges and keeping only our main object of interest in focus, timing and positioning executed with aplomb. And did I mention the close-ups? (Yes, I know I did.) One sequence, with Harry and Ginny running through a field of tall grass after intruding Death Eaters, is shot with a high speed pan to keep the characters crisp as the foliage darts and blurs in their wake. I'd be remiss not to mention the special effects as well, especially when dealing with the black smoke trails from Voldemort's flying goons as well as the wispy pensieve. Whether completely computer generated or practical dye clouds in water, the effect is pitch perfect, even dissolving each memory in sections, leaving important pieces, like young Tom Riddle, to be lingered on just a second longer than the rest.\n\nAs for the leads, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson are solid as usual, (Radcliffe showing some solid comedic chops after taking luck elixir), and Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley gets some room to break free. But it is the supporting roles that deserve notice. Helena Bonham Carter will scare children, so kudos to her, and Michael Gambon's Dumbledore will win even more hearts as his leader finally allows Potter into the inner circle of the plan to rid the world of Voldemort, it now being a circle of two. It is newcomer Jim Broadbent, however, as Professor Slughorn who steals the show. Broadbent is known for his many comical expressions and his rubber face is utilized to great effect here. A blowhard and man with many "friends", his jubilant smile and need to collect powerful and famous wizards for his Slug Club are ever-present, bringing some levity as well as effectively hiding the dark secret that lies beneath.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince succeeds in the details. It is an exercise in minimalism and showing only what is necessary to the plot. Condensing the novel better than ever done before, Kloves has given Yates the tools to make a film and not just a visual representation of the words. What had previously been done best by Azkaban's Alfonso Cuaron, this one works better at retaining more subplots and not stripping it quite so bare. Subtle hints are planted so no longwinded exposition is needed to make us, as an audience, feel stupid and lectured to. Instead Yates and crew allow us to show our intelligence and ability to use our eyes and memories to piece things together, making the experience more enjoyable as we believe we are solving the mysteries and not the director who is skillfully guiding us through. I'd say it couldn't get better than this, but my confidence in Yates has been renewed and my hopes that Deathly Hallows is treated with respect is at one hundred percent, so who knows what the future has to offer?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":501326,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2009-07-15","keywords":"school of magic,hereditary gift of witchcraft,murder,friendship,witchcraft","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince -- Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1061421849","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTI2Njk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3NDg0Mg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTI2Njk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3NDg0Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As Harry Potter begins his 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he discovers an old book marked mysteriously "This book is the property of the Half-Blood Prince" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.

Each tale relies so heavily on those that came before or after that one can never be a truly all-encompassing work. Sure, the three-act structure can be utilized, but without the background info, nor the knowledge that more will be coming, watching a middle installment alone will leave you confused and disorientated. The reason I bring this up is the fact that Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is good enough to warrant the praise and to put the idea in my head about whether to call it a masterpiece. The tone is perfect, the laughs are many, the darkness is charcoal black—how could this be the same director as the abysmal—in comparison to the rest of the series—Order of the Phoenix, David Yates? Two words   Bruno Delbonnel.\n\nWho is Delbonnel you may ask? Well, he is the brilliant cinematographer behind the camera. I may have blamed the failures of the fifth film on its screenplay as Steve Kloves was glaringly absent, (he being the writer of each other film, including this new one), but a film is a team effort. Therefore I guess maybe I shouldn't put all the accolades on one man now; I just feel absolutely compelled to do so because so many moments linger in my mind due to the beauty of their composition and use of their environments to stay interesting and exciting at all times. Visually, you cannot be bored. It just goes to show that it is never the director alone, but also the team he or she brings along. I like Yates and was surprised at how much I disliked his first foray in the Potter universe, granted, I felt the book itself was sub-par at best. Thankfully, he did not disappoint with his second of three, (make that four as book seven goes to a two-part finale), because, as it was with the novels, Half-Blood Prince is by far the best of the series—until Deathly Hallows of course. And adding the pedigree of a guy like Delbonnel, with films such as Across the Universe, A Very Long Engagement, and Amelie in his back pocket—all stunning works of art—only makes his job easier.\n\nI can't get over the use of close-ups throughout, or the multiple instances of framing used to hide something on screen. Oftentimes, the camera pans or cuts to reveal something in the fringes, to highlight the focal point when it's not centrally located, or literally move our eyes to exactly where the filmmakers want them to be. The blocking is superb with some scenes blurring the edges and keeping only our main object of interest in focus, timing and positioning executed with aplomb. And did I mention the close-ups? (Yes, I know I did.) One sequence, with Harry and Ginny running through a field of tall grass after intruding Death Eaters, is shot with a high speed pan to keep the characters crisp as the foliage darts and blurs in their wake. I'd be remiss not to mention the special effects as well, especially when dealing with the black smoke trails from Voldemort's flying goons as well as the wispy pensieve. Whether completely computer generated or practical dye clouds in water, the effect is pitch perfect, even dissolving each memory in sections, leaving important pieces, like young Tom Riddle, to be lingered on just a second longer than the rest.\n\nAs for the leads, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson are solid as usual, (Radcliffe showing some solid comedic chops after taking luck elixir), and Rupert Grint's Ron Weasley gets some room to break free. But it is the supporting roles that deserve notice. Helena Bonham Carter will scare children, so kudos to her, and Michael Gambon's Dumbledore will win even more hearts as his leader finally allows Potter into the inner circle of the plan to rid the world of Voldemort, it now being a circle of two. It is newcomer Jim Broadbent, however, as Professor Slughorn who steals the show. Broadbent is known for his many comical expressions and his rubber face is utilized to great effect here. A blowhard and man with many "friends", his jubilant smile and need to collect powerful and famous wizards for his Slug Club are ever-present, bringing some levity as well as effectively hiding the dark secret that lies beneath.\n\nHarry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince succeeds in the details. It is an exercise in minimalism and showing only what is necessary to the plot. Condensing the novel better than ever done before, Kloves has given Yates the tools to make a film and not just a visual representation of the words. What had previously been done best by Azkaban's Alfonso Cuaron, this one works better at retaining more subplots and not stripping it quite so bare. Subtle hints are planted so no longwinded exposition is needed to make us, as an audience, feel stupid and lectured to. Instead Yates and crew allow us to show our intelligence and ability to use our eyes and memories to piece things together, making the experience more enjoyable as we believe we are solving the mysteries and not the director who is skillfully guiding us through. I'd say it couldn't get better than this, but my confidence in Yates has been renewed and my hopes that Deathly Hallows is treated with respect is at one hundred percent, so who knows what the future has to offer?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":501326,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Family"],"datePublished":"2009-07-15","keywords":"school of magic,hereditary gift of witchcraft,murder,friendship,witchcraft","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince -- Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1061421849","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTI2Njk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3NDg0Mg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTI2Njk5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3NDg0Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As Harry Potter begins his 6th year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he discovers an old book marked mysteriously "This book is the property of the Half-Blood Prince" and begins to learn more about Lord Voldemort's dark past.

It Doesn't Deserve Walking Out On !","reviewBody":"In his famous TV show, (At The Movies), film critic Gene Siskel said that this was the first film he walked out on in 26 years of reviewing movies. Well, maybe he was having intestinal problem at the moment!\n\nWhen an important critic says that, it doesn't mean necessarily that he's right. Originally, you are the one who can make Siskel's reviews, or else's, look right or not. Because any film critic is speaking his own mind, not yours. Sometimes it's the same thing. And sometimes it isn't. This time, obviously for me, it isn't!\n\nThis is not a bad movie. The word "intolerable" got no relation with it whatsoever. It's a light and sweet slapstick. Nothing is too goofy or too zany. No one showed ridiculous performance. It reminded me with the work of Laurel &amp; Hardy, yet in colors, and with somehow thrilling plot. Chris Farley is doing his routine, and the chemistry between him and David Spade is working.\n\nThe actual problem was that this movie came after (Tommy Boy - 1995) which was a better movie. So the disappointment had to be powerful. And yes, you have to ask yourself; why after a comic detailed breakthrough such as (Tommy..), the new dual goes and make something which's clearly not better, or as good?! I believe the studio didn't know how to deal with the newly born star. So, they handled him any script just to exploit his success. But that wasn't for the sake of his career, us, and them; since the movie didn't hit the mark as its precedent.\n\nThe easy plan to invest Farley this time was by the reoccurrence of (Tommy..)'s factors. And sorrowfully Farley accepted it. Therefore some gags from the original (Tommy Boy) were recycled, however on a poor level with not much to support it either. For instance: the idea of idiot Farley and rational Spade, the problem of their sleep, even Spade got nothing new to show this round; he was repeating the whole thing yet weakly. And for some, it was hard to believe that the tongue-in-cheek was the movie's main, or only, goods!\n\nThough, (Black Sheep) isn't really a Black Sheep. It is relaxingly uncomplicated, and has its moments. Just imagine that it was made before (Tommy..) and they had to release it later, and everything will be fine. I loved its innocent cartoonish sense, running gags, the character of the old lunatic veteran (Oh God! So Gary Busey CAN do comedy!! WAW as long as you live, as along as you see and be surprised!), and the whole wacky time of it, where I didn't feel a single second of cheesiness, or repulsiveness, or bore.\n\nDear late Gene Siskel.. I admire many of your opinions. But, you were totally unfair towards this one. 1996 got some of the real agonizing comedies. (Kingpin) and (The Cable Guy) are little examples. Sometimes the critic, even the ordinary viewer, stands many movies good or bad, one after another, to have no patience for more. So walking out on a movie could mean that one critic was being tortured by one movie. Or that one critic just, for a reason out of the movie, couldn't have a good time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":38787,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1996-02-02","keywords":"clumsiness,embarrassment,political campaign,politics,crooked politician","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3586310425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTExYmI4NmQtMTdjOS00M2RmLWI0YzMtZmY1OTQ3ZTAxYmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTExYmI4NmQtMTdjOS00M2RmLWI0YzMtZmY1OTQ3ZTAxYmU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWpvaG5oYXJ0._V1_.jpg","description":"A gubernatorial candidate hires a wormy special assistant whose only job is to make sure the candidate's well-meaning but incompetent brother doesn't ruin the election."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000394/","name":"Chris Farley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005450/","name":"David Spade"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001513/","name":"Tim Matheson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0790715/","name":"Penelope Spheeris"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113592/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"}],"duration":"PT1H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However it really did tick most of the boxes for me. I found it engaging and entertaining all the way through, for me a film where you want to watch through to the end because you WANT to watch, not out of a masochistic urge to "find out what happens". Mark Wahlbergs performance was top notch. Although there are a few "no chance" moments in the film as there always are with these type of films, the majority of it was for me within the realms of possibility. The soundtrack was also excellent and melded well with the action on screen. Both myself and my Fiancée enjoyed this film greatly.

However it really did tick most of the boxes for me. I found it engaging and entertaining all the way through, for me a film where you want to watch through to the end because you WANT to watch, not out of a masochistic urge to "find out what happens". Mark Wahlbergs performance was top notch. Although there are a few "no chance" moments in the film as there always are with these type of films, the majority of it was for me within the realms of possibility. The soundtrack was also excellent and melded well with the action on screen. Both myself and my Fiancée enjoyed this film greatly. I can't really think of any negatives for this film and can only recommend it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321840,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-04-18","keywords":"voyeur,panties,cleavage,voyeurism,blond wig","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Shooter","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2928083225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDc3N2Q0NjMtNmZiMi00ZDFkLWFiZWEtNzM2NmFkNWI1MWNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDc3N2Q0NjMtNmZiMi00ZDFkLWFiZWEtNzM2NmFkNWI1MWNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0671567/","name":"Michael Peña","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0593961/","name":"Rhona Mitra"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0298807/","name":"Antoine Fuqua"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117723/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0247024/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0501380/","name":"Jonathan Lemkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2394211/","name":"Stephen Hunter"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The plot is decent, but somewhat ridiculous... and the pacing is awful. I was bored for most of the other half of this movie, despite it only being about 90 minutes long. The acting varies, but it's mostly bad... Kari Wuhrer displays a particularly obvious lack of talent, and Robert John Burke proves that he doesn't have the charisma or talent to carry a movie. Actually, Joe Mantegna pretty much steals the show, and every scene that doesn't involve him has you bored and wanting to see him again. The humor in the film is actually surprisingly good. There are some pretty good exchanges of dialog, and, as a nice variation from the typical King film-adaption, most of the laughs are intentional(though there are a few parts which still seem lame and make you laugh, as opposed to seeming scary and frighten you). The special effects vary, but for the most part, they are quite good. The films gore and violence may be a little over the top, and is definitely extreme, though there isn't terribly much of it in the film(but when there is, it's very graphic), but it didn't bother me as much as I had expected, from hearing it described by someone who has seen the film. Since I haven't really seen any other films by the director, Tom Holland, I can't say if fans of him will like this film. One thing that the fans of King will surely enjoy is that he himself has a role in this, and a pretty easily recognizable one, at that(not the typical somewhere-in-the-immediate-background cameo that writers/directors typically have). All in all, fairly enjoyable horror, but not something that you'll want to see many times. I recommend it to big fans of Stephen King, huge fans of the various actors, and people who just enjoy watching somewhat uneven films just for the heck of it. 5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29619,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1996-10-25","keywords":"gypsy,female stockinged legs,pantyhose,psychological thriller,overweight","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stephen King's Thinner","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1131459609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzc2NmFmMTMtYmVhMi00MmM1LWI5MWMtMTllNzMyOWI4ZDUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzc2NmFmMTMtYmVhMi00MmM1LWI5MWMtMTllNzMyOWI4ZDUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121559/","name":"Robert John Burke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001505/","name":"Joe Mantegna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0421087/","name":"Lucinda Jenney"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276169/","name":"Tom Holland"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0025957/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568313/","name":"Michael McDowell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276169/","name":"Tom Holland"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Here he is not only muggin the camera at its worst,it is also the most pathetic display of sympathy by a actor in recent months. Here is what the producers did here. First they bring on two of the stars from the first original "Friday" movie(Ice Cube and a suddenly aged Nia Long),and put them in a film that is supposed to be family oriented material,since the film uses every cliché from several films to bring this to the point of ridiculous mayhem. From there,they bring on two of the most misbehaving,obnoxious kids ever to sully the screen,exhibiting misbehavior to such an extreme that it goes beyond the point of normality which to say goes way beneath rude and disrespectful.

There are some really funny parts in this and I laughed a lot all the way through. Overall, a very smartly written romantic comedy that I really enjoyed. I surprisingly give this an A-.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":67844,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2014-09-26","keywords":"one night stand,internet hook up,snowed in,new york city,talking about sex","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi874163225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxOTgwMDE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI4MjA0MjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcxOTgwMDE2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjI4MjA0MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Twenty-something New Yorkers Megan and Alec are trapped together in AlecÂ’s Brooklyn apartment after what was supposed to be a no-strings attached, online hook-up.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1886602/","name":"Miles Teller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3006818/","name":"Lio Tipton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1221906/","name":"Jessica Szohr"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0629658/","name":"Max Nichols"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0575376/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0317576/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0348357/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3472302/","name":"Mark Hammer"],"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Fortunately, I didn't get my hopes up, and therefore I wasn't disappointed. The movie has its fair share of flaws, don't get me wrong. However, the movie made this Saw fan happy because it maintained the spirit of the series. The movie's biggest flaw is that it is by far the most unrealistic of the series and relies too much on chance within the story. Too many events are contingent on others, which makes Jigsaw look almost clairvoyant. However, I was able to look past this and enjoy the fourth Saw film.\n\nJigsaw (Tobin Bell) is dead. Though he is gone, he vows that his work will continue. And it appears he is true to his word, for SWAT Lt. Rigg (from Saw 2 &amp; 3) is the latest member of the police force to be thrust into one of Jigsaw's deadly games. Meanwhile, Detective Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) is joined by a pair of FBI agents to help stop the Jigsaw killer once and for all...They'll start by looking into his past, beginning with his ex wife, Jill.\n\nThe acting is pretty good. Costas Mandylor, Tobin Bell, and Scott Patterson are the standouts. Bell brings so much more to the character this time around through flashbacks as we learn more about John Kramer. Showing that he has created one of the most memorable characters of recent memory, Bell makes us almost sympathize with him, despite the acts he has committed. Mandylor is really good as Detective Hoffman, even though he has limited screen time and dialog. I liked Patterson a lot because of the toughness and reality he brought to the character. Agent Strahm is a good character and definitely one of my favorites in the series. One big surprise was Lyric Bent as Rigg. He definitely showed a lot of range in this movie. He has a future.\n\nThe plot is probably the most complex, as there can be as many as 3 different subplots going on at the same time, all while the audience has questions from the first 3 movies answered. The ending also leaves a little to be desired, as it is the least impacting twist of the series (and most obvious). However, I really enjoyed the traps, which were definitely a step up from Saw 3. The random gore was kept to a minimum, but the beginning is absolutely horrifyingly gory. It also felt rushed, which means I can't wait to see the unrated DVD. Hopefully it'll have more extra footage than the others. Saw 4 has the weakest script of the series, but it's still better than I expected. At this point, it appears as if Darren Bousman is going through the motions, and that's what keeps the series spirit alive. As long as Bousman, Wan, or Whannell continue to be involved, the spirit should live on. I also have to give props to the editor for the smooth and catchy transitions, not to mention the production design is top notch. That and the lighting provide at least some horror realism, as the plot does border on absurd at times. The sound is better than ever, with the classic 'Hello, Zepp' tune that has become one of the most recognizable tracks in movie history making its dramatic appearance in the climax of the film. The ending also leaves us wanting more, so I'm expecting Saw 5 next Halloween.\n\n8/10 --spy","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":145953,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2007-11-21","keywords":"serial rapist,ex wife,tied to a chair,bound and gagged,brutality","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Saw IV Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3031499033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI4MjgzNjI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjI4MjgzNjI2Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkzMTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Saw IV Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068551/","name":"Tobin Bell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0666398/","name":"Scott Patterson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0274371/","name":"Louis Ferreira"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1135423/","name":"Darren Lynn Bousman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0137447/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0184201/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0786360/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1733317/","name":"Patrick Melton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1729303/","name":"Marcus Dunstan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272090/","name":"Thomas Fenton"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And neither have I seen it when I saw the much-praised sequel HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY. But that's just what I really like about this sequel: It doesn't require you to have seen the original to fully enjoy this weird and entertaining excursion. Seeing the original would certainly add to the experience, but taken in its own rights, HELLBOY II does what a sequel should do: Not just live up to the expectations left by its predecessor, but also shine as a stand-alone effort.\n\nAnd yet I have another confession: I have not seen Guillermo Del Toro's crown jewel PAN'S LABYRINTH yet. But seeing HELLBOY II, I am more than impressed by his wild imagination. HELLBOY may have been based on a comic book, but for anyone who isn't a fan of the comics, Hellboy is Del Toro's own creation. Like what Tim Burton did with BATMAN, Del Toro has modeled Hellboy (Ron Perlman) as his own creation on-screen, and he's a very interesting character. Perlman never wastes his opportunity to provide depth as well as nuance to his character. Perlman proves himself worthy, not just an ideal action hero (under tons of make-up), but as yet another actor who successfully embodies the role of a comic-book character.\n\nAs in PAN'S LABYRINTH, Del Toro populates the world of HELLBOY II with some truly fascinating and intriguing creatures. Roger Ebert made a truthful compliment by stating that the world of HELLBOY II reminded him of the famous Cantina scene from STAR WARS. What George Lucas has conceived within only a few minutes of screen time in his movie, Del Toro manages to do for 2 hours. The creatures are imaginative, not just in look but in personality, and they are at an abundance. Plus, they're also mostly done using make-up effects rather than CGI, which makes them all the more real. Add to Del Toro's imaginative set pieces, he is a master storyteller. From the opening scene, where "Broom" Bruttenholm (John Hurt) tells the legend of the "Golden Army" to a young Hellboy, Del Toro exhibits is true talents at telling a good story. There are moments of thrills and even laughs, and the visuals are superb. Supporting performances and some neat special effects (notice that I praised the CGI later in in this review) make for one worthy adventure ride. HELLBOY II isn't perfect, but it sure is great at what it was doing.\n\nRating: **** out of 5.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":262855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-10-08","keywords":"superhero,twins,friendship,cat,elf","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. teaser trailer: Hellboy II: The Golden Army","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1588723993","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIwMDU5MjI5N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjM2ODc5._V1_.jpg","description":"This is a teaser trailer for Hellboy II: The Golden Army, directed by Guillermo del Toro"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000579/","name":"Ron Perlman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004757/","name":"Selma Blair"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0427964/","name":"Doug Jones"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020061/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239918/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0868219/","name":"Guillermo del Toro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0586005/","name":"Mike Mignola"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

And neither have I seen it when I saw the much-praised sequel HELLBOY II: THE GOLDEN ARMY. But that's just what I really like about this sequel: It doesn't require you to have seen the original to fully enjoy this weird and entertaining excursion. Seeing the original would certainly add to the experience, but taken in its own rights, HELLBOY II does what a sequel should do: Not just live up to the expectations left by its predecessor, but also shine as a stand-alone effort.\n\nAnd yet I have another confession: I have not seen Guillermo Del Toro's crown jewel PAN'S LABYRINTH yet. But seeing HELLBOY II, I am more than impressed by his wild imagination. HELLBOY may have been based on a comic book, but for anyone who isn't a fan of the comics, Hellboy is Del Toro's own creation.

This statement is justified because as someone who has never watched any Star Trek involving the TNG cast it does stand alone side the best 'Trek' films.\n\nStar Trek: First Contact is set six years after Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) had been rescued from the Borg and he is stilled plagued with nightmares and flashbacks. Now the Borg have started to invade the Federation and the battle is only won by the Enterprise's late intervention. However the Borg have a trick up the sleeve and travel back in time to conquer Earth. The Enterprise crew is unaffected and it is up to them to travel back to stop the Borg conquest and help the legendary Zefram Cochrane (James Cromwell) who achieved the first wrap flight and made contact with an alien race.\n\nLike 'Wrath of Khan' 'First Contact' was a continuation of a critically acclaimed episode, but even if you haven't seen it 'First Contact' works on its own terms and finds that sweet spot to appeal to fans and non-fans alike and matching the two tones the franchise has straddled, dark and brooding and light-hearted and funny. The film has with a dark image of Picard being assimilated into the Borg and his eye about to drilled before waking up and all the half of the film that features the Borg is the most atmospheric. The Borg are great villains, a near unstoppable hive a races that have been conquered, a collective that all linked together who work as one unit.\n\nPicard's assimilation with the Borg is both an advantage and disadvantage. Picard knows how the Borg operates and their tactics, so knows how to fight them, but he desire for revenge make Picard irrational. It's like Khan who could have been free after capturing the Enterprise in 'Wrath of Khan' but his want for revenge against Kirk is his downfall. Stewart gave a passionate speech about not sacrificing the Enterprise to the Borg.\n\nThe Borg's assimilation of the Enterprise makes for a dark and dank atmosphere compared to the more brightly lit environments of the Enterprise. It is this sector of the film where we saw the Borg Queen (Alice Krige), the voice and personification of the Borg collective. Her introduction was impressive, her human body being lowered into a cybernetic body, CGI effects that still hold up today. Most of the Borg Queen's interactions are with Data (Brent Spiner), trying to convince him to join the collective, making him more human to attractive this.\n\nThe cliché perspective of Star Trek from non-fans is that it a slow, boring franchise that only appeals to a hardcore fanbase. "First Contact" blows that perspective out of the water - it starts with a huge space battle between the Federation and the Borg as the alien hive try to invade Earth and there are sprinklings of actions scenes throughout the film. One of the best is scene when three members of the Enterprise crew having to stop the Borg from creating a satellite dish - it was a tense scene that was similar to the assassination of the Klingon Chancellor in "The Undiscovered Country".\n\nThe action on Earth where Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Geordi La Forge (LeVar Burton) help Cochran with the first warp flight is more lighter in tone. The more comedic approach combined with the time travel story, cultural clash and essentially revealing the future to Cochrane made this half of film similar to "The Voyage Home". Cochrane is hailed a hero by everyone in the Federation, a man whose action united Earth, made a scientific breakthrough and made his planet a player in galactic politics but the reality was he was a drunk, he wanted to make money and is overwhelmed by finding out what his future holds. It made the character more human as he has to accept his destiny and James Cromwell, being the professional that he is was brilliant at humanising the character as he drunkenly dances and having the deal with the weight on his shoulders.\n\n"First Contact" is a film that works for both fans and non-fans alike, having action, being able to balance a dark plot with lighter moments and working as a continuation and a standalone film, being a strong sci-fi film in its own right.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":121652,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1996-11-22","keywords":"first contact,post world war three,zefram cochrane character,experimental technology,nuclear missile","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Star Trek: First Contact","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1265677337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjExMjg1ZWItYjAzNy00NTAwLWIxZTgtMTU2NjFjNzE4ZWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjExMjg1ZWItYjAzNy00NTAwLWIxZTgtMTU2NjFjNzE4ZWY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000408/","name":"Jonathan Frakes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000653/","name":"Brent Spiner"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000408/","name":"Jonathan Frakes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0437457/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734472/","name":"Gene Roddenberry"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0075834/","name":"Rick Berman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0103804/","name":"Brannon Braga"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I mean, "Asteroid-a-Geddon", seriously? Yeah, well still I ended up sitting down to watch this disaster movie. And then the logo of The Asylum came up on the screen, and I just knew it was going to be one of those movies.\n\nLet's just be honest, The Asylum is not exactly known for their track record of putting out super impressive movies. Sure, once in a blue moon they manage to release something that is outstanding in comparison to their usual releases.

It is high on adventure and comedy, and wins because of it.  The sets, scenery, special effects are all first-rate.  The film is fast-paced from beginning to end and is very suspenseful.  Stephen Sommers again shows his talent as a director for creating action-packed adventure with a high level of comedic overtones.  The cast are all very good in their roles, yet none of them seem really to be taking themselves or the film too serious.  Brendan Fraser is an affable hero, and Rachel Weisz makes a good heroine.  Good support comes from John Hannah, Kevin J. O'Connor, and the mummy, Arnold Vosloo.  Also a real treat was seeing Bernard Fox in a small role as an aging British pilot.  Don't expect the old mummy of lore in this one, but sit down and have one heck of a ride...a rollercoaster of hijinks in the sands of Egypt."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":408149,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1999-05-07","keywords":"mummy,mummy character,good versus evil,gallows,1920s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Mummy (1999) Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3743267865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRmYzcwMTktMDVmMC00Y2JmLTgxZDctN2ZlM2IzMmU3MGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRmYzcwMTktMDVmMC00Y2JmLTgxZDctN2ZlM2IzMmU3MGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"At an archaeological dig in the ancient city of Hamunaptra, an American serving in the French Foreign Legion accidentally awakens a mummy who begins to wreck havoc as he searches for the reincarnation of his long-lost love."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001838/","name":"Rachel Weisz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001314/","name":"John Hannah"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285126/","name":"Lloyd Fonvielle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0418883/","name":"Kevin Jarre"}],"duration":"PT2H4M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is high on adventure and comedy, and wins because of it.  The sets, scenery, special effects are all first-rate.  The film is fast-paced from beginning to end and is very suspenseful.  Stephen Sommers again shows his talent as a director for creating action-packed adventure with a high level of comedic overtones.  The cast are all very good in their roles, yet none of them seem really to be taking themselves or the film too serious.  Brendan Fraser is an affable hero, and Rachel Weisz makes a good heroine.  Good support comes from John Hannah, Kevin J. O'Connor, and the mummy, Arnold Vosloo.  Also a real treat was seeing Bernard Fox in a small role as an aging British pilot.  Don't expect the old mummy of lore in this one, but sit down and have one heck of a ride...a rollercoaster of hijinks in the sands of Egypt.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":408149,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1999-05-07","keywords":"mummy,mummy character,good versus evil,gallows,1920s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Mummy (1999) Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3743267865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRmYzcwMTktMDVmMC00Y2JmLTgxZDctN2ZlM2IzMmU3MGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRmYzcwMTktMDVmMC00Y2JmLTgxZDctN2ZlM2IzMmU3MGVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"At an archaeological dig in the ancient city of Hamunaptra, an American serving in the French Foreign Legion accidentally awakens a mummy who begins to wreck havoc as he searches for the reincarnation of his long-lost love.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000409/","name":"Brendan Fraser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001838/","name":"Rachel Weisz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001314/","name":"John Hannah"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0285126/","name":"Lloyd Fonvielle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0418883/","name":"Kevin Jarre"],"duration":"PT2H4M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So with new writers (Simon Pegg and Doug Jung) and a new director (Justin Lin, known for directing some of the Fast and Furious films) is Star Trek Beyond able to recapture the original feeling of Star Trek? Yes, it more than does this. In fact this ,the third film in the new series of Star Trek movies, feels like an extended episode from the original series.

Another thing that new director Lin has been able to successfully do is bring the audience into the actual adventure, the audience doesn't just watch the film they are almost taking part, they are made to feel as if they are in the same world, the exact same situations as the characters causing them to not only laugh along with them when there are comedic moments ,which nearly always hit the right mark, but also feel involved in the action and the adventure. The chemistry between all the characters is always on top form and all actors clearly get on well making the on screen chemistry more realistic especially between Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto) and Bones (Karl Urban). The characters of Spock and Bones ,helped by Pegg and Jung's script, go together so well creating a really well thought out and timed double act while still keeping the frame of the original characters, still providing the much needed action and adventure that is vital to this sort of film. As for the Visual Effects ,next to Ghostbusters, they are some of the best to be seen on the big screen this year and go towards creating an even greater sense of realism and once again pulling the audience in with immense ease.\n\nFans will be pleased by this new entry into the Star Trek series, because Star Trek Beyond not only feels like a successful extended episode but the acting, story, characters, action, effects and so much more go towards creating a fun, crowd pleasing sci-fi adventure.\n\n**** &lt;-- Four Stars","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":237315,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-07-21","keywords":"star trek,third part,alien,stranded,sequel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi354465561","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODk2NzY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1Mjc0OTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMyODk2NzY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI1Mjc0OTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The USS Enterprise crew explores the furthest reaches of uncharted space, where they encounter a new ruthless enemy who puts them and everything the Federation stands for to the test."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0704270/","name":"Zachary Quinto"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0881631/","name":"Karl Urban"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0510912/","name":"Justin Lin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152219/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0708328/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0670408/","name":"Simon Pegg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1136647/","name":"Doug Jung"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734472/","name":"Gene Roddenberry"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>
