Volume two is a completely different movie than volume one, but it's equally brilliant and the director's trademarks are shown more than obviously. Volume one merely was homage to the Eastern Martial Arts movies, with delightfully over-the-top splatter and gore while Vol. 2 fully focuses on ancient westerns and rural horror.

Some unexplained elements from Vol.1 become clear now and even the entire background of Thurman's character gets unveiled. For the very first time, (as far as I can remember) Tarantino really knows how to create an unbearable tension!

Truly terrific filmmaking. \n\nThe actors in Kill Bill aren't Hollywood's best, but they each have their charisma and their typical Tarantino characters do the rest.

While the audience at first thinks it was a perfectly banal accident, their doubt is being fuelled scene after scene...\n\nVeerle Baetens' en Anne Coessens' performances are filled with subtle mistrust and held-back anger. These two characters playing off each other are a true feast for the spectators. Also the young Jules Lefebre acts with a maturity beyond his years. The cinematography by Hichame Alaouie is effective and - even though the pace at times threatens to slow down a bit too much - keeps every scene interesting and fresh: playing with angles, lighting and other effects to signify the slow descent into madness. Olivier Masset-Depasses' direction is clean, whilst never sinking into blandness.\n\nHowever, the omnipresent score is overblown and lacks subtlety, but regularly does capture the right atmosphere for the scene. The story after a while threatens to loose its own point, but regains its footing again in the finale. And what a chilling finale that was! One last nit-picking comment can be that the film could have raised uncertainty and suspicion even more than it in fact did.\n\nFinally, one cannot ignore the not-so-subtle hints to Hitchcock's work in the production design, costumes and building of tension.

While the audience at first thinks it was a perfectly banal accident, their doubt is being fuelled scene after scene...\n\nVeerle Baetens' en Anne Coessens' performances are filled with subtle mistrust and held-back anger. These two characters playing off each other are a true feast for the spectators. Also the young Jules Lefebre acts with a maturity beyond his years. The cinematography by Hichame Alaouie is effective and - even though the pace at times threatens to slow down a bit too much - keeps every scene interesting and fresh: playing with angles, lighting and other effects to signify the slow descent into madness. Olivier Masset-Depasses' direction is clean, whilst never sinking into blandness.\n\nHowever, the omnipresent score is overblown and lacks subtlety, but regularly does capture the right atmosphere for the scene. The story after a while threatens to loose its own point, but regains its footing again in the finale. And what a chilling finale that was! One last nit-picking comment can be that the film could have raised uncertainty and suspicion even more than it in fact did.\n\nFinally, one cannot ignore the not-so-subtle hints to Hitchcock's work in the production design, costumes and building of tension. It's expertly done and - in my humble opinion - this movie is perfectly capable of standing between great names such as 'Rear Window' and 'The Man Who Knew Too Much'.

His last movie I saw, Mr. Brooks, was pretty good also. I would call this movie a political satire, that tries to be a little funny at times. However, the idea that one guy determines the presidential election is absurd, but if you can get past that, then the plot is OK. It was funny how the movie had the political parties doing adds for things they oppose. Example, the democrats supporting pro life because Bud says he's pro life.\n\nThe plot is struggling, every day man, Bud Johnson, just got laid off. He has a very smart daughter and she cares about the presidential election. Bud promises to vote since Molly thinks it's important. But, when he doesn't show, Molly votes in his place but the power goes out and the vote didn't count. The election comes down to New Mexico and for some reason, not told in the movie, Bud's vote will decide the electoral votes. I mean, how could the votes be even for each side and even if they were very close, how many months would it take for all the recounts that would take place. But any way, it's up to Bud, whom doesn't care about politics. He becomes an instant celebrity and is courted by both candidates. By the end of the film, Bud grows an appreciation for the political scene and realizes that it is important to care about social issues.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Funnier than I thought and provides a message. Plus, the movie doesn't try to say that one party is better than the other.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18365,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-08-01","keywords":"awakened by one's daughter,father daughter relationship,presidential candidate,election returns,election coverage","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Swing Vote","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2363687193","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMDM1OTc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA0MDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMDM1OTc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA0MDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Swing Vote Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000126/","name":"Kevin Costner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1745736/","name":"Paula Patton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001288/","name":"Kelsey Grammer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0827750/","name":"Joshua Michael Stern"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0237137/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0725034/","name":"Jason Richman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0827750/","name":"Joshua Michael Stern"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1250389/","name":"David Giammarco"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His last movie I saw, Mr. Brooks, was pretty good also. I would call this movie a political satire, that tries to be a little funny at times. However, the idea that one guy determines the presidential election is absurd, but if you can get past that, then the plot is OK. It was funny how the movie had the political parties doing adds for things they oppose. Example, the democrats supporting pro life because Bud says he's pro life.\n\nThe plot is struggling, every day man, Bud Johnson, just got laid off. He has a very smart daughter and she cares about the presidential election. Bud promises to vote since Molly thinks it's important. But, when he doesn't show, Molly votes in his place but the power goes out and the vote didn't count. The election comes down to New Mexico and for some reason, not told in the movie, Bud's vote will decide the electoral votes. I mean, how could the votes be even for each side and even if they were very close, how many months would it take for all the recounts that would take place. But any way, it's up to Bud, whom doesn't care about politics. He becomes an instant celebrity and is courted by both candidates. By the end of the film, Bud grows an appreciation for the political scene and realizes that it is important to care about social issues.\n\nFINAL VERDICT: Funnier than I thought and provides a message. Plus, the movie doesn't try to say that one party is better than the other.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":18365,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-08-01","keywords":"awakened by one's daughter,father daughter relationship,presidential candidate,election returns,election coverage","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Swing Vote","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2363687193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMDM1OTc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA0MDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwMDM1OTc1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTA0MDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Swing Vote Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000126/","name":"Kevin Costner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1745736/","name":"Paula Patton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001288/","name":"Kelsey Grammer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0827750/","name":"Joshua Michael Stern"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049348/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0237137/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0725034/","name":"Jason Richman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0827750/","name":"Joshua Michael Stern","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1250389/","name":"David Giammarco"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's the laid-back Aussie humour that international audiences sometimes just don't understand which prevents the majority of Australian films from crossing the cultural barrier.

As a child she was sent to a boarding school in Melbourne by Sergeant Farrat (Hugo Weaving) for she was accused of murdering a boy who bullied her. Her mother, Molly (Judy Davis) initially doesn't recognise her and isn't convinced she's her daughter. She eventually accepts her in her house and Tilly transforms it into a fashion factory where she makes clothes for the women of the town. In the meantime, she becomes romantically involved with Teddy McSwiney (Liam Hemsworth) whom she has known since they were children.

There might be a few too many flashbacks and slow motion sequences but the compelling storyline featuring a wide range of interesting characters allows the majority of the film to shine. Some of the depictions of the characters might be broad but that's just the perfect fit for quintessential Australians. \n\nA lot of the dialogue is witty and adds much to the Aussie humour on show. Davis garners most of the laughs in a performance which demonstrates her sensational acting ability. Winslet perfects the Aussie accent with this being her second time playing an Australian after 1999's Holy Smoke! Many of the scenes she shares with her screen mother are hilarious. Weaving also has his turn in the spotlight with a wonderful performance as the cross-dressing police officer. Hemsworth plays it straight in comparison to his co-stars and reliably fulfills his role as the love interest. Support actors such as Shane Bourne, Sarah Snook, Kerry Fox and Barry Otto also succeed in projecting the individual traits of their characters.\n\nCredit must go to the costume designs with the haute couture style befitting of the movie title. With the story being reminiscent of a Clint Eastwood western where the main character comes to town, mingles with the locals then affects their lives one way or another, the music score by David Hirschfelder has some resemblance to a western. It's an exciting score that perfectly sets up the moods of the characters and the theme of the plot. The cinematography by Donald McAlpine also enhances the look of the film, ensuring that the rural town maintains its 'western' appearance.\n\nAlthough clichés do affect the characters and story, the overall quality of the film ensures that most viewers will be entertained. Jocelyn Moorhouse (the director and co-writer) should be chuffed with her film's box office success even though not all critics have praised her work.

But for a view of how the real people at the heart of this whole affair were really affected then the writers, directors and actors have done a good job.\n\nYes, it is low key in its look and feel. Yes, there are a lot of people who know Salisbury thinking 'that's not somewhere I recognise'; the use of locations from other cathedral cities threw me off the narrative a couple of times wondering where the characters were meant to be. But most importantly it drew me in to understanding more of how just frightening the possible outcome of not having an early intervention could have been and the emotional strain on those key families.\n\nFor you 1 star reviewers I say your expectations were skewed from the start. It was good to see what felt like a truthful docu-drama.\n\nAnd as my son said at the end of part 3, 'well, that was emotional.'","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4401,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-06-14","keywords":"poisoning,salisbury wiltshire,year 2018,nerve agent,british police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1245863/","name":"Rafe Spall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240359/","name":"Anne-Marie Duff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2118257/","name":"Annabel Scholey"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0645108/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2779562265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNlNGI3NzMtZDRkMC00MjdkLTgwYTUtY2ViZDcwYjJlMDJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNlNGI3NzMtZDRkMC00MjdkLTgwYTUtY2ViZDcwYjJlMDJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In March 2018, the eyes of the world turned to the British city of Salisbury when it became the epicenter of what has been described as one of the biggest political events of the 21st century -- but until now, the heroic acts behind the headlines have not been told. Within three days of the assassination attempt on double agent and spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, key agencies discovered that a lethal nerve agent called Novichok was used, just half a teaspoon of which could kill 20,000 people. Within four days, hundreds of traces were found across the city, and, just when things were finally thought to be under control, a perfume bottle containing the nerve agent was discovered, throwing the investigation into renewed chaos."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But it seems unfair to compare a sequel to its predecessor when the film is a sequel in name only. Other than the opening which re-tracks the memorable final scenes from the original, FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE mostly flies solo. \n\nThe cast was excellent.

But it seems unfair to compare a sequel to its predecessor when the film is a sequel in name only. Other than the opening which re-tracks the memorable final scenes from the original, FORCE 10 FROM NAVARONE mostly flies solo. \n\nThe cast was excellent. Robert Shaw and Edward Fox are good replacements to Gregory Peck and David Niven in the roles of Keith Mallory and Major Miller. Harrison Ford absolutely amazing as Lt. Col. Barnsby.

There's a lot of futuristic noir flourishes, the movie is bathing in neon light and seedy environments. This isn't new, its Blade Runner-esque but the cinematography is admittedly gorgeous in this. Just because it has been done before (lately with Altered Carbon and Mute) doesn't make it any less impressive. It was a nice touch and it deserves to be mentioned, even if it doesn't quite save the movie.\n\nThe plot of Terminal is very reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's movies. There's some Snatch or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels moments but the whole movie doesn't operate as well overall. We get introduced to a bunch of seedy characters with dubious morals. They all come in and out of this train station in the middle of the night and the common thread between them is the character of Annie (Margot Robbie). She's an assassin who works part-time as a waitress and stripper. Through her comings and goings, we meet a terminally ill teacher Bill (Simon Pegg), a pair of mismatched hitmen Vince (Dexter Fletcher) and Alfred (Max Irons) and an odd janitor Clinton (Mike Myers). How these interactions play into the larger plot is a mystery to us until the final turn. The setup isn't bad, we've seen it before and although there are plot holes, none of them were bad enough to completely derail the movie. It was enough to keep me interested but I did find my attention drifting in and out because of the lack of cohesion. As a story, its very middle of the road for the genre.\n\nAny heat for this movie was likely due to Margot Robbie's involvement as the main character. She keeps climbing the ladder and its deserved, she's great and I consider myself a fan of hers. She's good in Terminal, she's surprisingly committed, and she carries the movie capably. I do agree with some of the other reviewers in that she comes off as British Harley Quinn, but she didn't phone it in. Pegg is his typical charming self, he's very low-key in this but he works well with Robbie and I particularly enjoyed the montage that they share near the tail-end of the movie. Fletcher and Irons were odd, neither of them were terrible but Fletcher was over doing it and Irons was a little stiff. It was nice to see Mike Myers again and I think he did about as well as he could have with the material. Its a big distance from where his character starts to where he ends up and it makes his performance a little awkward by the end.\n\nI was down the middle on Terminal for most of its run time for all the reasons listed above. It was never stellar, but it had its moments. I was more than ready to just let it float the rest of the way to whatever normal twist ending it had up its sleeve and call it a day. But when the confrontation comes between Annie and Bill, the movie doesn't just dip its toes into a pool of nonsense/crazy, it cannonballs into it. I wasn't just snickering, I was laughing when Terminal ended. Its not that the twist it takes is new, its handled in such a rough and implausible manner that I was shocked. But it didn't derail the movie for me, it actually improved it. It made Terminal memorable and while I would never say that this movie is good, its going to hold a place in my memory for insane plot twists.\n\nI feel a little guilty for giving Terminal as high of a rating as I have. I liked the style of the movie and some of the performances (notably Robbie, Pegg and some of Myers) were solid. But it never reached high enough for something great and in any other movie, that twist ending would have knocked it down to a 3 or a 4/10. But that ending pushed the movie from mediocre to so bad its good territory for me. I can't call Terminal excellent but if you enjoy campy cinema, this is something you should see. I'm giving Terminal a 6/10 and I feel like I'm being generous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21313,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-11","keywords":"bare chested male bondage,tied to a bed,revenge,written by director,wager","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi671922201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0Y2YwZDktYzc3Mi00ZjE3LWI3NmMtNjZiYmFlYTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0Y2YwZDktYzc3Mi00ZjE3LWI3NmMtNjZiYmFlYTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the dark heart of a sprawling, anonymous city, 'Terminal' follows the twisting tales of two assassins carrying out a sinister mission, a teacher battling a fatal illness, an enigmatic janitor and a curious waitress leading a dangerous double life.

It stars Bridget Fonda, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Steven Weber, Peter Friedman and Stephen Tobolowsky. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Luciano Tovoli.\n\nWhen it's revealed that her partner Sam (Weber) has been cheating on her with his ex-wife, Allie Jones (Fonda) kicks him out of the apartment and advertises for a female roommate. She chooses Hedra Carlson (Leigh), who on the surface seems to be the perfect roommate. Smoothly helping Allie through her crisis, a real friendship is formed, but it's not long before Hedra starts to exhibit some dark behaviour patterns ..\n\nThe early 90s saw the "Woman from Hell" back in vogue in mainstream cinema. After the success and publicity of Fatal Attraction (1987), there was a period where you feel that sensible film makers wisely chose to let that particular film disappear from the film lovers memory banks. As it happens, they must have collectively chose 5 years as the cooling off period. For 1992 saw a wave of mad female on the loose pictures released. Led by the publicity gobbling Basic Instinct, films such as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Single White Female put bums on cinema seats and reopened the "Mad Bitch" sub-genre. Of the three, Single White Female grossed the least, which is strange since it's a better movie than the other two.\n\nSchroeder's (Barfly/Reversal of Fortune) movie isn't a complete success, there's not enough development of the main characters and there's some unintentionally funny moments. But when it's good it's real good. Reeling off a number of memorable and often chilling scenes, film is further boosted by the psychological smarts in Roos' (Boys on the Side) screenplay. It helps that Schroeder has a knack for pacing, too, where he neatly simmers the plot until the spill over for the big finale. No disappointment there either, a good combination of genre staples is enhanced in impact by some unexpected character developments, and there's moments of genuine suspense to lure the viewer to the edge of their seat. \n\nIt's also stylishly shot by Schroeder and Tovoli (Suspiria/Tenebrae). Allie's Upper West Side apartment is imposing and expansive, with high ceilings, old time plumbing, a clunky lift and a dingy laundry in the basement. It's a different set-up for such a thriller, no picket fence harmony house or beach side residence, this is bustling New York, big spaces, but as it turns out, that means no hiding place. The boys behind the cameras get the maximum they can from the locale by blending imposing and ominous with grainy veneer and filtered light. On the acting front, the girls put great effort into making their thinly developed characters work, with Leigh doing a good line in progressive instability. While Friedman, Weber and a wonderfully naughty Tobolowsky, make the most of their secondary roles. \n\nOne or two obvious flaws aside, this still rounds out as a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. 7.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-08-14","keywords":"female star appears nude,roommate,female nudity,bound and gagged,woman in bathtub","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2455550745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000403/","name":"Bridget Fonda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000492/","name":"Jennifer Jason Leigh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001836/","name":"Steven Weber"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0775447/","name":"Barbet Schroeder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661375/","name":"John Lutz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740400/","name":"Don Roos"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It stars Bridget Fonda, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Steven Weber, Peter Friedman and Stephen Tobolowsky. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Luciano Tovoli.\n\nWhen it's revealed that her partner Sam (Weber) has been cheating on her with his ex-wife, Allie Jones (Fonda) kicks him out of the apartment and advertises for a female roommate. She chooses Hedra Carlson (Leigh), who on the surface seems to be the perfect roommate. Smoothly helping Allie through her crisis, a real friendship is formed, but it's not long before Hedra starts to exhibit some dark behaviour patterns ..\n\nThe early 90s saw the "Woman from Hell" back in vogue in mainstream cinema. After the success and publicity of Fatal Attraction (1987), there was a period where you feel that sensible film makers wisely chose to let that particular film disappear from the film lovers memory banks. As it happens, they must have collectively chose 5 years as the cooling off period. For 1992 saw a wave of mad female on the loose pictures released. Led by the publicity gobbling Basic Instinct, films such as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Single White Female put bums on cinema seats and reopened the "Mad Bitch" sub-genre. Of the three, Single White Female grossed the least, which is strange since it's a better movie than the other two.\n\nSchroeder's (Barfly/Reversal of Fortune) movie isn't a complete success, there's not enough development of the main characters and there's some unintentionally funny moments. But when it's good it's real good. Reeling off a number of memorable and often chilling scenes, film is further boosted by the psychological smarts in Roos' (Boys on the Side) screenplay. It helps that Schroeder has a knack for pacing, too, where he neatly simmers the plot until the spill over for the big finale. No disappointment there either, a good combination of genre staples is enhanced in impact by some unexpected character developments, and there's moments of genuine suspense to lure the viewer to the edge of their seat. \n\nIt's also stylishly shot by Schroeder and Tovoli (Suspiria/Tenebrae). Allie's Upper West Side apartment is imposing and expansive, with high ceilings, old time plumbing, a clunky lift and a dingy laundry in the basement. It's a different set-up for such a thriller, no picket fence harmony house or beach side residence, this is bustling New York, big spaces, but as it turns out, that means no hiding place. The boys behind the cameras get the maximum they can from the locale by blending imposing and ominous with grainy veneer and filtered light. On the acting front, the girls put great effort into making their thinly developed characters work, with Leigh doing a good line in progressive instability. While Friedman, Weber and a wonderfully naughty Tobolowsky, make the most of their secondary roles. \n\nOne or two obvious flaws aside, this still rounds out as a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. 7.5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-08-14","keywords":"female star appears nude,roommate,female nudity,bound and gagged,woman in bathtub","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2455550745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000403/","name":"Bridget Fonda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000492/","name":"Jennifer Jason Leigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001836/","name":"Steven Weber"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0775447/","name":"Barbet Schroeder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661375/","name":"John Lutz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740400/","name":"Don Roos"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It doesn't deserve its reputation as a bad film, because it isn't bad, nor is it great.\n\nOn the plus side, it has some scary moments, Michael's character is well used.

There's a lot of futuristic noir flourishes, the movie is bathing in neon light and seedy environments. This isn't new, its Blade Runner-esque but the cinematography is admittedly gorgeous in this. Just because it has been done before (lately with Altered Carbon and Mute) doesn't make it any less impressive. It was a nice touch and it deserves to be mentioned, even if it doesn't quite save the movie.\n\nThe plot of Terminal is very reminiscent of Guy Ritchie's movies. There's some Snatch or Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels moments but the whole movie doesn't operate as well overall. We get introduced to a bunch of seedy characters with dubious morals. They all come in and out of this train station in the middle of the night and the common thread between them is the character of Annie (Margot Robbie). She's an assassin who works part-time as a waitress and stripper. Through her comings and goings, we meet a terminally ill teacher Bill (Simon Pegg), a pair of mismatched hitmen Vince (Dexter Fletcher) and Alfred (Max Irons) and an odd janitor Clinton (Mike Myers). How these interactions play into the larger plot is a mystery to us until the final turn. The setup isn't bad, we've seen it before and although there are plot holes, none of them were bad enough to completely derail the movie. It was enough to keep me interested but I did find my attention drifting in and out because of the lack of cohesion. As a story, its very middle of the road for the genre.\n\nAny heat for this movie was likely due to Margot Robbie's involvement as the main character. She keeps climbing the ladder and its deserved, she's great and I consider myself a fan of hers. She's good in Terminal, she's surprisingly committed, and she carries the movie capably. I do agree with some of the other reviewers in that she comes off as British Harley Quinn, but she didn't phone it in. Pegg is his typical charming self, he's very low-key in this but he works well with Robbie and I particularly enjoyed the montage that they share near the tail-end of the movie. Fletcher and Irons were odd, neither of them were terrible but Fletcher was over doing it and Irons was a little stiff. It was nice to see Mike Myers again and I think he did about as well as he could have with the material. Its a big distance from where his character starts to where he ends up and it makes his performance a little awkward by the end.\n\nI was down the middle on Terminal for most of its run time for all the reasons listed above. It was never stellar, but it had its moments. I was more than ready to just let it float the rest of the way to whatever normal twist ending it had up its sleeve and call it a day. But when the confrontation comes between Annie and Bill, the movie doesn't just dip its toes into a pool of nonsense/crazy, it cannonballs into it. I wasn't just snickering, I was laughing when Terminal ended. Its not that the twist it takes is new, its handled in such a rough and implausible manner that I was shocked. But it didn't derail the movie for me, it actually improved it. It made Terminal memorable and while I would never say that this movie is good, its going to hold a place in my memory for insane plot twists.\n\nI feel a little guilty for giving Terminal as high of a rating as I have. I liked the style of the movie and some of the performances (notably Robbie, Pegg and some of Myers) were solid. But it never reached high enough for something great and in any other movie, that twist ending would have knocked it down to a 3 or a 4/10. But that ending pushed the movie from mediocre to so bad its good territory for me. I can't call Terminal excellent but if you enjoy campy cinema, this is something you should see. I'm giving Terminal a 6/10 and I feel like I'm being generous.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21313,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-11","keywords":"bare chested male bondage,tied to a bed,revenge,written by director,wager","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi671922201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0Y2YwZDktYzc3Mi00ZjE3LWI3NmMtNjZiYmFlYTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0Y2YwZDktYzc3Mi00ZjE3LWI3NmMtNjZiYmFlYTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the dark heart of a sprawling, anonymous city, 'Terminal' follows the twisting tales of two assassins carrying out a sinister mission, a teacher battling a fatal illness, an enigmatic janitor and a curious waitress leading a dangerous double life.

Pretty soon the two are trying to get away from the cop as well as two drug lords in the middle of a war. As far as pot comedies goes this one here is nearly the best the small genre has to offer. I'm sure Cheech and Chong would give this thing two bongs up as it does contain plenty of laughs but I couldn't help but feel it had the same shortcomings as other Judd Apatow movies. That one issue with this film, as well as the others, is that it runs too long for its own good. Clocking in a nearly two-hours I couldn't help but feel that the film could have lost thirty-minutes and not much would have been missed. This is especially true during the ending shoot out, which just keeps going and going. Outside of that issue this film contains some great big laughs with most of them coming in the form of pot jokes and stuff dealing with stoners. Seth Rogan turns in another winning performance as he gains plenty of laughs from his older guy. James Franco is the real jewel in the film as he's dead-on perfect as the drug dealing loser who just sits around his house getting high, selling pot and watching reruns on television. Franco gets the look down just right but his facial gestures and voice tone perfectly capture that pot head many of us have met in our lives. I thought Perez was pretty much wasted in a thankless role that didn't offer her too much to do. Ed Begley, Jr. has a funny bit as Rogan's girlfriend's father. The screenplay really doesn't offer us any jokes we haven't seen countless times before and in many ways there's not an original idea here but that doesn't really matter because the performances are what makes the movie funny."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":327808,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"stoner,falling downhill,watching tv,man tied up,handcuffed man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pineapple Express: Theatrical trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2729574681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170550/","name":"Gary Cole"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0337773/","name":"David Gordon Green"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1698571/","name":"Evan Goldberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Pretty soon the two are trying to get away from the cop as well as two drug lords in the middle of a war. As far as pot comedies goes this one here is nearly the best the small genre has to offer. I'm sure Cheech and Chong would give this thing two bongs up as it does contain plenty of laughs but I couldn't help but feel it had the same shortcomings as other Judd Apatow movies. That one issue with this film, as well as the others, is that it runs too long for its own good. Clocking in a nearly two-hours I couldn't help but feel that the film could have lost thirty-minutes and not much would have been missed. This is especially true during the ending shoot out, which just keeps going and going. Outside of that issue this film contains some great big laughs with most of them coming in the form of pot jokes and stuff dealing with stoners. Seth Rogan turns in another winning performance as he gains plenty of laughs from his older guy. James Franco is the real jewel in the film as he's dead-on perfect as the drug dealing loser who just sits around his house getting high, selling pot and watching reruns on television. Franco gets the look down just right but his facial gestures and voice tone perfectly capture that pot head many of us have met in our lives. I thought Perez was pretty much wasted in a thankless role that didn't offer her too much to do. Ed Begley, Jr. has a funny bit as Rogan's girlfriend's father. The screenplay really doesn't offer us any jokes we haven't seen countless times before and in many ways there's not an original idea here but that doesn't really matter because the performances are what makes the movie funny.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":327808,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2008-08-06","keywords":"stoner,falling downhill,watching tv,man tied up,handcuffed man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pineapple Express: Theatrical trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2729574681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc4NTY4NzYxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk3NDEyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for David Gordon Green's Pineapple Express.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0170550/","name":"Gary Cole"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0337773/","name":"David Gordon Green"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0073081/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1698571/","name":"Evan Goldberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0031976/","name":"Judd Apatow"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He goes alone and stumbles on to a circus and a beautiful female bear named Ursa. Switching places with a male bear named Doug, his friends in the forest soon become worried.\n\nThe reviews for this film are not stellar, and I think I can sum up why: the original voice cast is not involved in this picture, so the characters sound funny. The plot is thin, and the movie comes in under 90 minutes, letting you know that they didn't have a strong story (even including the dogs and cats seems forced because it is not related to the main story at all).\n\nFor me, I liked the film. I don't have a strong attachment to the original, so I wasn't as offended. And I think kids will like it. Sure, the voice for Boog was annoying... but then, I loved the dogs and cats, so it's a toss-up. I felt like this was going to be a launching pad for a TV series, because it has a "Madagascar" feel to it... but with its poor reception, that may not be likely.\n\nIf you have kids, let them check it out. They may be less cynical than adult viewers, and it's not all bad. I learned what a camelid is... that may be worth the price of renting the film. But then again, maybe not. My girlfriend watched it with me and fell asleep... what does that tell you?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11099,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-01-25","keywords":"russian,circus,prince and pauper,look alike,role reversal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Open Season 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi205691161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NjExNjI0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NjExNjI0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Boog's friends really to bring him home from a Russian traveling circus."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3103829/","name":"Matthew J.

He goes alone and stumbles on to a circus and a beautiful female bear named Ursa. Switching places with a male bear named Doug, his friends in the forest soon become worried.\n\nThe reviews for this film are not stellar, and I think I can sum up why: the original voice cast is not involved in this picture, so the characters sound funny. The plot is thin, and the movie comes in under 90 minutes, letting you know that they didn't have a strong story (even including the dogs and cats seems forced because it is not related to the main story at all).\n\nFor me, I liked the film. I don't have a strong attachment to the original, so I wasn't as offended. And I think kids will like it. Sure, the voice for Boog was annoying... but then, I loved the dogs and cats, so it's a toss-up. I felt like this was going to be a launching pad for a TV series, because it has a "Madagascar" feel to it... but with its poor reception, that may not be likely.\n\nIf you have kids, let them check it out. They may be less cynical than adult viewers, and it's not all bad. I learned what a camelid is... that may be worth the price of renting the film. But then again, maybe not. My girlfriend watched it with me and fell asleep... what does that tell you?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11099,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-01-25","keywords":"russian,circus,prince and pauper,look alike,role reversal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Open Season 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi205691161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NjExNjI0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NjExNjI0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Boog's friends really to bring him home from a Russian traveling circus.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3103829/","name":"Matthew J.

If it was just a movie on its own, unrelated to Surf's Up... ok, maybe? But do NOT call this Surf's Up. Plus, there was no actual surfing in it. The original movie didn't leave us needing another movie to finish the story because the story was already done.

Main characters from the last movie weren't even there and the storyline was completely changed. The WWE character idea doesn't have anything to do with surfing. If it was just a movie on its own, unrelated to Surf's Up... ok, maybe? But do NOT call this Surf's Up. Plus, there was no actual surfing in it. The original movie didn't leave us needing another movie to finish the story because the story was already done. If you're a huge fan like me and needed to see Surf's Up 2, don't get your hopes up.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2041,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-01-17","keywords":"animal,quicksand,penguin,otter,sequel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Surf's Up 2: WaveMania","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2436216345","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjODM0Y2UtOTBhMy00NzE0LTlhZmItNTMwNzc1MDJjZjk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjODM0Y2UtOTBhMy00NzE0LTlhZmItNTMwNzc1MDJjZjk1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Surf's Up 2: WaveMania","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1660179/","name":"Jeremy Shada","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417647/","name":"Jon Heder","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3596979/","name":"Melissa Sturm"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4401911/","name":"Henry Yu"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0157814/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0121181/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242604/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2226110/","name":"Abdul Williams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0105169/","name":"Ash Brannon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0118333/","name":"Chris Buck"],"duration":"PT1H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...\n\nAt other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.\n\nApart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.\n\nAnd, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.\n\nChow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.\n\nThe center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the "Luke Skywalker" of the piece, if you will...though "Crouching Tiger..." has everything the "Star Wars" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.\n\nBy the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the "Full Peckinpaw," if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.\n\nThere are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!\n\nI won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.\n\nMy recommendation: Just go see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."

It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.\n\nI thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.\n\nBottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).\n\nIf you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-08-04","keywords":"gunslinger,based on novel,prophetic dream,another world,parallel dimension","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1690417433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, roams an Old West-like landscape where "the world has moved on" in pursuit of the man in black.

Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-08-04","keywords":"gunslinger,based on novel,prophetic dream,another world,parallel dimension","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1690417433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, roams an Old West-like landscape where "the world has moved on" in pursuit of the man in black.

But, as we saw in the final frames, something else was now inhabiting Josh's body and it had strangled paranormal investigator Elise (Lin Shaye) to death. We pick up as the unsuspecting family, including older son Foster (Andrew Astor) and their infant daughter Kali, have moved in with Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) while police investigate Elise's mysterious death in their house. They are barely moved in when supernatural occurrences start to begin again with objects moving, spectral voices, apparitions appearing and dear old dad acting very strange. While Renai tries to deal with the fact that supernatural forces are still with them, Josh tries to convince her all is well and Lorraine decides to team up with Elise's former assistants paranormal investigators Specs (Leigh Whannell who also wrote the screenplay) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) along with one of the original investigators from Josh's childhood haunting, Carl (Steve Coulter) to get down to the bottom of these haunted hi-jinx once and for all. And that is all I will say about the story as, despite some familiar trappings, James Wan (The Conjuring) takes this installment in some clever directions and once again uses the familiar elements very well. We get to know the story behind the evil woman in black seen in the last film and even revisit The Further though, this time it is inventively linked to events in the first film. The pace is a bit slower and more methodical this time round but, since this film is a bit of a mystery as well as haunting, it takes it's time to let the story unfold and secrets be revealed. We still get some spooky scenes but, it is refreshingly mixed in with Lorraine and co's equally goose bump inducing investigation. And what they find is deviously fun. The film is not quite as lively as Insidious part one but, I liked the mystery element and the film earned points with me for using it's return to 'The Further' a bit more clever and less silly then last time. That is the point where the first film lost it's grip on me and here I like how it was done and was with this supernatural chiller up to the spooky end. Wan is a good director and he takes what could have been a ho-hum retread and makes it a fun follow-up. He gets good performances out of all his cast and while I found Patrick Wilson to be bland in both Insidious and The Conjuring, he gets a far more lively performance out of him here. He gets to ham it up a bit and it suits him. The film has some beautiful and creepy visuals, as is Wan's trademark, and Joseph Bishara's score adds some nice atmosphere too. So in conclusion, while the story elements are more familiar; we've seen some of it before and the pace a bit slower, Wan does give us a spooky mystery to add to the paranormal activity and makes much more clever use of his otherworldly 'Further'. He also gives us some clever answers to the questions left by his first Insidious and that all adds up to a spooky fun time at the movies. Also stars House Of The Devil's Joceline Donahue as young Lorraine in some equally clever flashback sequences that tie into the rest of the film in a fun way."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164356,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-09-13","keywords":"police detective,barricading a door,injection in leg,taser,attacked with a knife","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4286163225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg","description":"A haunted family struggles to uncover a terrifying secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world in Insidious: Chapter 2."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001347/","name":"Barbara Hershey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314851/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0222021/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While Renai tries to deal with the fact that supernatural forces are still with them, Josh tries to convince her all is well and Lorraine decides to team up with Elise's former assistants paranormal investigators Specs (Leigh Whannell who also wrote the screenplay) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) along with one of the original investigators from Josh's childhood haunting, Carl (Steve Coulter) to get down to the bottom of these haunted hi-jinx once and for all. And that is all I will say about the story as, despite some familiar trappings, James Wan (The Conjuring) takes this installment in some clever directions and once again uses the familiar elements very well. We get to know the story behind the evil woman in black seen in the last film and even revisit The Further though, this time it is inventively linked to events in the first film. The pace is a bit slower and more methodical this time round but, since this film is a bit of a mystery as well as haunting, it takes it's time to let the story unfold and secrets be revealed. We still get some spooky scenes but, it is refreshingly mixed in with Lorraine and co's equally goose bump inducing investigation. And what they find is deviously fun. The film is not quite as lively as Insidious part one but, I liked the mystery element and the film earned points with me for using it's return to 'The Further' a bit more clever and less silly then last time. That is the point where the first film lost it's grip on me and here I like how it was done and was with this supernatural chiller up to the spooky end. Wan is a good director and he takes what could have been a ho-hum retread and makes it a fun follow-up. He gets good performances out of all his cast and while I found Patrick Wilson to be bland in both Insidious and The Conjuring, he gets a far more lively performance out of him here. He gets to ham it up a bit and it suits him. The film has some beautiful and creepy visuals, as is Wan's trademark, and Joseph Bishara's score adds some nice atmosphere too. So in conclusion, while the story elements are more familiar; we've seen some of it before and the pace a bit slower, Wan does give us a spooky mystery to add to the paranormal activity and makes much more clever use of his otherworldly 'Further'. He also gives us some clever answers to the questions left by his first Insidious and that all adds up to a spooky fun time at the movies. Also stars House Of The Devil's Joceline Donahue as young Lorraine in some equally clever flashback sequences that tie into the rest of the film in a fun way.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164356,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-09-13","keywords":"police detective,barricading a door,injection in leg,taser,attacked with a knife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4286163225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg","description":"A haunted family struggles to uncover a terrifying secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world in Insidious: Chapter 2.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001347/","name":"Barbara Hershey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314851/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0222021/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His real problem is that his landlord is dead, laid out on the linoleum of his kitchen, and Switzerland seems farther away all the time.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0524240/","name":"Matt Lucas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001780/","name":"Peter Stormare","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001001/","name":"James Caan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0959774/","name":"Jonas Åkerlund"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0337652/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139919/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0374424/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2411346/","name":"Chris Millis"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is one of those films that I am going to have to watch again because the audience was laughing so loud and long that I fear I missed some of the jokes. That being said  .. Kevin Hart (Cedric) is a fool (in a good way). He had me (and the rest of the audience) cracking up. His comic timing and expressions are priceless. The relationship between Dominic (Michael Ealy) and Lauren (Taraji P Henson) was probably the most honest (compared to the others). I like the reference that they made to For Colored Girls (classic). I have always considered Michael Ealy to be very sexy and he did not disappoint in this film (Yum). Michael (Terrance Jenkins) was a true mama's boy almost to the point of being sickening, but Candace (Regina Hall) did what she had to do to rectify that situation. The longtime relationship between Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) and Kristen (Gabrielle Union) is one that a lot of couples will be able to relate to. Finally, Zeke (Romany Malco) . What can I say, there are a bunch of you out there and I am glad that Mya (Meagan Good) stuck to her guns. The only negative thing that I would say about the film is that I am not sure that Alex (Chris Brown) needed to keep popping in on the scenes. It was kind of redundant since the film already had a "playa". Wendy Williams (Gail) and Sherri Shephard (Vicki) had small roles in the film, but it was good to see the talk show hosts represent. I think that a lot of people may see this film as a "chick flick", but I like to think of it as a great date movie. I think that the implied war of the sexes will appeal to all and if nothing else, Kevin Hart will keep you in stitches. This film is well worth the price of a ticket.

This is one of those films that I am going to have to watch again because the audience was laughing so loud and long that I fear I missed some of the jokes. That being said  .. Kevin Hart (Cedric) is a fool (in a good way). He had me (and the rest of the audience) cracking up. His comic timing and expressions are priceless. The relationship between Dominic (Michael Ealy) and Lauren (Taraji P Henson) was probably the most honest (compared to the others). I like the reference that they made to For Colored Girls (classic). I have always considered Michael Ealy to be very sexy and he did not disappoint in this film (Yum). Michael (Terrance Jenkins) was a true mama's boy almost to the point of being sickening, but Candace (Regina Hall) did what she had to do to rectify that situation. The longtime relationship between Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) and Kristen (Gabrielle Union) is one that a lot of couples will be able to relate to. Finally, Zeke (Romany Malco) . What can I say, there are a bunch of you out there and I am glad that Mya (Meagan Good) stuck to her guns. The only negative thing that I would say about the film is that I am not sure that Alex (Chris Brown) needed to keep popping in on the scenes. It was kind of redundant since the film already had a "playa". Wendy Williams (Gail) and Sherri Shephard (Vicki) had small roles in the film, but it was good to see the talk show hosts represent. I think that a lot of people may see this film as a "chick flick", but I like to think of it as a great date movie. I think that the implied war of the sexes will appeal to all and if nothing else, Kevin Hart will keep you in stitches. This film is well worth the price of a ticket. Put down the book and get out and see this film because this will be the one that they will be talking about next to the water cooler on Monday. I am giving this film a green light.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45842,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2012-07-11","keywords":"animated credits,four word title,african american,african american protagonist,interracial friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3746799129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE3MDAwNzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk5MTUxNw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODE3MDAwNzIzOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk5MTUxNw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four friends conspire to turn the tables on their women when they discover the ladies have been using Steve Harvey's relationship advice against them."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2093097/","name":"Chris Brown"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005517/","name":"Gabrielle Union"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366389/","name":"Kevin Hart"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1103162/","name":"Tim Story"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045552/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0146485/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2226647/","name":"Keith Merryman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2226970/","name":"David A.

It is a mediocre movie at the very best and I wouldn't even go that far. I have no idea how such a flick can get an 8.1. Maybe all the actors and their their entire families gave it a 10. I don't know and I don't care. My only motivation to deal with this movie a little longer than the 90 minutes it lasted is to prevent others from making the same mistake I did. So here is my review that says everything there is to say about this flick: THIS IS NOT A GOOD MOVIE. STORY AND ACTING ARE WAY BELOW AVERAGE.

This is one of those films that I am going to have to watch again because the audience was laughing so loud and long that I fear I missed some of the jokes. That being said  .. Kevin Hart (Cedric) is a fool (in a good way). He had me (and the rest of the audience) cracking up. His comic timing and expressions are priceless. The relationship between Dominic (Michael Ealy) and Lauren (Taraji P Henson) was probably the most honest (compared to the others). I like the reference that they made to For Colored Girls (classic). I have always considered Michael Ealy to be very sexy and he did not disappoint in this film (Yum). Michael (Terrance Jenkins) was a true mama's boy almost to the point of being sickening, but Candace (Regina Hall) did what she had to do to rectify that situation. The longtime relationship between Jeremy (Jerry Ferrara) and Kristen (Gabrielle Union) is one that a lot of couples will be able to relate to. Finally, Zeke (Romany Malco) . What can I say, there are a bunch of you out there and I am glad that Mya (Meagan Good) stuck to her guns. The only negative thing that I would say about the film is that I am not sure that Alex (Chris Brown) needed to keep popping in on the scenes. It was kind of redundant since the film already had a "playa". Wendy Williams (Gail) and Sherri Shephard (Vicki) had small roles in the film, but it was good to see the talk show hosts represent. I think that a lot of people may see this film as a "chick flick", but I like to think of it as a great date movie. I think that the implied war of the sexes will appeal to all and if nothing else, Kevin Hart will keep you in stitches. This film is well worth the price of a ticket. Put down the book and get out and see this film because this will be the one that they will be talking about next to the water cooler on Monday.

In this case it is the boy who returns to the small town, but the girl is still uptight - only mildly, and it is her that has the folksy job. Horrendously predictable with the the expected conflict, but the conflict happened later on and wasn't nearly as bad as expected.

Kyra's dreams of being a jeweler have been put on the backburner, as her demanding job at the Sawyer Country Club is her priority.

Enter Aiden Sawyer, prodigal son, big-city business magnate and Kyra's childhood nemesis, returning home to the country club his parents own. As they patch up their past, Kyra and Aiden learn that there may be something more between them than just playful flirting.

Either you watch Unhinged for the thrilling entertainment or for the eye opening message the results is quite satisfying on both ends.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":59311,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-07-31","keywords":"stabbed in the eye with scissors,driving,road rage,psychopath,stalking","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3319512601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA2MWY5ZGQtNmZkNS00NzFiLTlhNTYtMWJmMzA2ZDVlNDYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjA2MWY5ZGQtNmZkNS00NzFiLTlhNTYtMWJmMzA2ZDVlNDYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Academy Award winner Russell Crowe stars in a timely psychological thriller that explores the fragile balance of a society pushed to the edge, taking something we’ve all experienced — road rage — to an unpredictable and terrifying conclusion.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3308569/","name":"Caren Pistorius","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5145655/","name":"Gabriel Bateman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0097517/","name":"Derrick Borte"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0784470/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0531993/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0716530/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0255296/","name":"Carl Ellsworth"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Its obvious from the start that this is very different movie in tone and in production values than anything which appeared after the initial trilogy. This is a much more serious and darker film, gone is the comedic tone and in its place we get much better action sequences and a real air of menace. There definite and deliberate nods to the movie Predator, particularly in the action scenes. One in particular midway through the movie is simply the best action scene in any Tremors movie. The production values for this are probably the best in the franchise. We have stunning visuals as this is set in Thailand which gives the movie a kind of Jurassic Park prehistoric vibe but the cinematography is worth a mention. Probably a first for a Tremors movie. The cast are great and unexpectedly (to me any) Jon Heder shows up as does an English actress mainly known for TV shows who plays Berts ex love interest, Fans of the franchise will be more than happy with this edition although there is an obvious departure from the previous formula. This perhaps signals an end to either the saga or possibly a shift away to a new Tremors series of movies. I wouldn't complain if they did based on this episode. I gave this a 6 however as its still a Tremors movie and partly for the ending...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3773,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-10-20","keywords":"sequel,seventh part,direct to video sequel to theatrical movie,island,view through binoculars","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tremors: Shrieker Island","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4072522009","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjhmNzE5MzQtZmI2NC00OGY1LWEyYzUtY2JlOTJjMzZkNjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjhmNzE5MzQtZmI2NC00OGY1LWEyYzUtY2JlOTJjMzZkNjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0343447/","name":"Michael Gross"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417647/","name":"Jon Heder"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104114/","name":"Richard Brake"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0666806/","name":"Don Michael Paul"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0082064/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0359888/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0666806/","name":"Don Michael Paul"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1014503/","name":"Brian Brightly"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934093/","name":"S.S.

Its obvious from the start that this is very different movie in tone and in production values than anything which appeared after the initial trilogy. This is a much more serious and darker film, gone is the comedic tone and in its place we get much better action sequences and a real air of menace. There definite and deliberate nods to the movie Predator, particularly in the action scenes. One in particular midway through the movie is simply the best action scene in any Tremors movie. The production values for this are probably the best in the franchise. We have stunning visuals as this is set in Thailand which gives the movie a kind of Jurassic Park prehistoric vibe but the cinematography is worth a mention. Probably a first for a Tremors movie. The cast are great and unexpectedly (to me any) Jon Heder shows up as does an English actress mainly known for TV shows who plays Berts ex love interest, Fans of the franchise will be more than happy with this edition although there is an obvious departure from the previous formula. This perhaps signals an end to either the saga or possibly a shift away to a new Tremors series of movies. I wouldn't complain if they did based on this episode. I gave this a 6 however as its still a Tremors movie and partly for the ending...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3773,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-10-20","keywords":"sequel,seventh part,direct to video sequel to theatrical movie,island,view through binoculars","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tremors: Shrieker Island","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4072522009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjhmNzE5MzQtZmI2NC00OGY1LWEyYzUtY2JlOTJjMzZkNjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjhmNzE5MzQtZmI2NC00OGY1LWEyYzUtY2JlOTJjMzZkNjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0343447/","name":"Michael Gross","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417647/","name":"Jon Heder","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104114/","name":"Richard Brake"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0666806/","name":"Don Michael Paul"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0082064/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0359888/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0666806/","name":"Don Michael Paul","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1014503/","name":"Brian Brightly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934093/","name":"S.S.

A Polish-directed/written film set in China with basically an entirely Chinese cast? A bit foreign for me (being from the US), to say the least.\n\nStarting out with the main character Wolski escaping from Russian Siberia into China, you watch as he is taken in by a poor Chinese family consisting of Guo, his wife, and their daughter Song. So far, so good.\n\nHowever, one night Song gets up from the dinner table and takes some food to Wolski. As soon as she sits down on his bed Guo comes in and knocks the food right out of her hand. From this moment on, Song is never the same, and you will see why.\n\nMy main complaint of this movie is that it is slow and lacks focus/direction in the early (after the first 9min) to middle parts. It is a bit slow but luckily it picks up in the last third.\n\nOne thing this movie does well is subtlety. Maybe this is a trait of foreign films in general? I am not sure because I haven't seen enough. My recommendation is if you're a fan of or interested in foreign films and enjoy short but sincere romances, then give this film a shot.\n\nOtherwise, it might not be for you. I think I got something out of it, and for an otherwise stoic personality like myself, it definitely touched me.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-09-01","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954076/","name":"Michal Zebrowski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1546399/","name":"Li Min"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2066134/","name":"Sun Ji Feng"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111369/","name":"Jacek Bromski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080717/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093398/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111369/","name":"Jacek Bromski"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Kochankowie roku tygrysa: Directed by Jacek Bromski. With Michal Zebrowski, Li Min, Sun Ji Feng, Wu Fen Xia. The year is 1913. Two Poles escape exile and cross the Siberian taiga to China. Crossing the Amur River ends tragically for one of them. The surviving man, unconscious, is found by an old Chinese hunter who takes him to his mountain shack. The hunter has a beautiful, sixteen year old daughter. Not to tempt fortune, the parents make the girl cut her hair and dress like a boy.

A Polish-directed/written film set in China with basically an entirely Chinese cast? A bit foreign for me (being from the US), to say the least.\n\nStarting out with the main character Wolski escaping from Russian Siberia into China, you watch as he is taken in by a poor Chinese family consisting of Guo, his wife, and their daughter Song. So far, so good.\n\nHowever, one night Song gets up from the dinner table and takes some food to Wolski. As soon as she sits down on his bed Guo comes in and knocks the food right out of her hand. From this moment on, Song is never the same, and you will see why.\n\nMy main complaint of this movie is that it is slow and lacks focus/direction in the early (after the first 9min) to middle parts. It is a bit slow but luckily it picks up in the last third.\n\nOne thing this movie does well is subtlety. Maybe this is a trait of foreign films in general? I am not sure because I haven't seen enough. My recommendation is if you're a fan of or interested in foreign films and enjoy short but sincere romances, then give this film a shot.\n\nOtherwise, it might not be for you. I think I got something out of it, and for an otherwise stoic personality like myself, it definitely touched me.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":120,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"genre":["Adventure","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-09-01","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0954076/","name":"Michal Zebrowski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1546399/","name":"Li Min","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2066134/","name":"Sun Ji Feng"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111369/","name":"Jacek Bromski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080717/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093398/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0111369/","name":"Jacek Bromski"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For example, Ferzan used child actors for the first time, which has a great impact on the texture of the film, both young actors.\n\nIt is a pity that it was not screened in many countries of the world, including Turkey. The blu-ray copy that came out in Europe is beautifully crafted.\n\nThe movie reminded me that I miss Ferzan the most. It's been 4 years since I've seen him. Maybe one day I'll get a Blu-Ray copy of this movie signed as well.\n\nWhile even Blockbuster films were heavily affected by the covid-19 process, such naive films unfortunately boiled away.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1851,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-19","keywords":"friend,gay,gay couple,marital crisis,infidelity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4219846425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4N2NjNzMtM2QzOC00ZDM5LTk0OTgtM2U5NDJjNDgyZDRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzI4N2NjNzMtM2QzOC00ZDM5LTk0OTgtM2U5NDJjNDgyZDRkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009629/","name":"Stefano Accorsi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0872910/","name":"Jasmine Trinca","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0502412/","name":"Edoardo Leo"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654858/","name":"Ferzan Ozpetek"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021904/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0278508/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654858/","name":"Ferzan Ozpetek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710011/","name":"Silvia Ranfagni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0739744/","name":"Gianni Romoli"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Most married couples can probably relate to the grind of a life absorbed with work and parenting. Sometimes the fantasy turns into having a quiet moment of solitude. Heck, even "date night" can devolve into just another responsibility tacked on at the end of a long week. This is the premise for director Shawn Levy's film. The best part? It doesn't matter at all.\n\nThe reason this film works is not the plot or script, but rather the talents of the two funniest people in showbiz today: Steve Carell and Tina Fey. The two seem to have an exceptional comedic connection that brings out a timing that reminds of the best comedy teams of all time.\n\nSometimes what makes for the funniest comedy is putting "normal" people into exceptional situations and let them react. Here, Carell and Fey are just a typical suburban couple trying to re-ignite the luster of an all too comfortable marriage. The motivation comes when their friends (Mark Ruffalo and Kristen Wiig) announce they are splitting. This starts Carell and Fey off on a series of skits that would make Seinfeld proud.\n\nThe nightmare begins when the couple "steals" a reservation in a hot new restaurant and assume the identity of, what turns out to be a couple of low level thieves. The multitude of skits that follow include supporting work from dirty cops (Common and Jimmi Simpson), the real reservation holders (funny James Franco and Mila Kunis), a mob boss (Ray Liotta), a corrupt city official (William Fichtner) and a "security expert" in the eternally shirtless Mark Wahlberg.\n\nThe approach of the film reminds me of "After Hours", "Adventures in Babysitting" and "The Out of Towners". Some of the best comedy occurs when the main players aren't tossing out incessant one-liners. Think back to Cary Grant's screwball comedies. He was not a bumbling idiot or a stand-up comedian walking through life. His characters were reactionary to the odd-ball situations in which he was placed. That is the approach of Carell and Fey, and I hope they pursue future projects together.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":158357,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-04-09","keywords":"downtown,desire,thug,criminal,kingpin","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Date Night: International Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2353399065","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyMDQ0ODcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTIyMDQ0ODcxNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTg4NDczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City, a case of mistaken identity turns a bored married couple's attempt at a glamorous and romantic evening into something more thrilling and dangerous."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0275486/","name":"Tina Fey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158853/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0458441/","name":"Josh Klausner"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I gave this a 6 however as its still a Tremors movie and partly for the ending...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3773,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2020-10-20","keywords":"sequel,seventh part,direct to video sequel to theatrical movie,island,view through binoculars","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tremors: Shrieker Island","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4072522009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjhmNzE5MzQtZmI2NC00OGY1LWEyYzUtY2JlOTJjMzZkNjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjhmNzE5MzQtZmI2NC00OGY1LWEyYzUtY2JlOTJjMzZkNjM5XkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0343447/","name":"Michael Gross","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1417647/","name":"Jon Heder","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104114/","name":"Richard Brake"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0666806/","name":"Don Michael Paul"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0082064/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0359888/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0666806/","name":"Don Michael Paul","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1014503/","name":"Brian Brightly","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934093/","name":"S.S.

The ensemble cast is superb, the young actors and the more experienced ones are all popular stars in Japan.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":870,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Adventure","History"],"datePublished":"2019-02-22","keywords":"imperialism,jidaigeki,spy,american imperialism,katana","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2615398/","name":"Takeru Satoh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5862455/","name":"Nana Komatsu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1719673/","name":"Mirai Moriyama"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0741262/","name":"Bernard Rose"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0240064/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029168/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0519722/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6044596/","name":"Akihiro Dobashi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0741262/","name":"Bernard Rose","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1158253/","name":"Hiroshi Saitô"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The cast are all spectacularly talented, and this film is another of those 'secret classics' which don't get the Oscars but actually deserve them. Gina Prince-Bythewood, the woman director, has made an intensely sensitive film about women, and it ain't no chick flic, it is serious stuff. I was knocked out by the sheer talent of the actresses. An eye opener to me was the incredible Queen Latifah. Apparently she is some kind of 'hip hop queen', but I wouldn't know about that, preferring Bach myself. She also 'raps', and I am one of those people who does not like or understand what they call 'rapping' at all, so I am glad she spared us that in the film. I notice from her bio that she was a basketball star in high school. Now that I can well believe, as she has the same 'body confidence' that another basketball player, Barack Obama, has. The director made a feature film about basketball earlier, so maybe that is how she and Miss Hip Hop the Rapper came together. But this woman Queen Latifah is a major example of Something Else. She has super-star quality. Really, I wanted to just rush up and hug her, that is how wonderful I think she was. However, the finest job of acting in this film full of genius is to my mind undoubtedly that of Sophie Okonedo, who plays the character May Boatwright, whose older sister and protector is Queen Latifah. She portrays a girl so tormented by 'not being quite right in the head', and so over-sensitive that she bursts into tears at the slightest thing, that it is hard to believe she is acting. It is a poignant performance, expressing to perfection the desperation of such a person who knows there is something wrong with her but can do nothing about it. The third sister is played by Alicia Keys, in real life a talented musician as well, and she portrays an over-intense hard-as-nails young woman terrified of marital commitment. Into this family comes the now teenaged Dakota Fanning, 'running away from home' as it were. She is making some progress with her speaking. Instead of 80 percent of her words being mumbled it is now down to about 20 percent. If she could ever master speech so that everything she said was comprehensible and audible, she could become a major actress, as her acting abilities are coming along nicely, and she effortlessly dominates scenes as long as Queen Latifah is not around (who has a greater command of the camera). I must say however that Dakota Fanning looked very tired to me, and maybe she ought to take a few months off, as she could burn out if she doesn't watch it, having worked non-stop practically since she was in the womb (I'm amazed she didn't star in something as a foetus). As for the story, it is very moving and emotional, a study in human conflicts, traumas, and feelings. This is the kind of film that women make, whereas men prefer making films where everybody gets killed. There's a gender lesson there somewhere! In this film, not even hope gets killed. So that means there is still hope. Jennifer Hudson gives wonderful support as the character Rosaleen, who accompanies Dakota Fanning as she flees from her father to take refuge with these women who had once known her dead mother. This is a happy-sad story that tears and warms the heart at the same time. Any woman would love it, and even some men might like it in between all the crime movies and battle scenes which they normally watch, where the quality is so often judged quantitatively, i.e. by the body count or by the sizes of the explosions. Here the only quantities involved are the degrees of emotion, which are in the upper nineties at least.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-10-17","keywords":"f rated,cake,neglected child,psychological abuse,freedom","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Secret Lives of Bees: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2605646105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for The Secret Lives of Bees, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266824/","name":"Dakota Fanning"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1617685/","name":"Jennifer Hudson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001946/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1650330/","name":"Sue Monk Kidd"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Here the only quantities involved are the degrees of emotion, which are in the upper nineties at least.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25639,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-10-17","keywords":"f rated,cake,neglected child,psychological abuse,freedom","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Secret Lives of Bees: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2605646105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxNjk0NTM4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTY3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the first theatrical trailer for The Secret Lives of Bees, directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266824/","name":"Dakota Fanning","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1617685/","name":"Jennifer Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028932/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001946/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0697656/","name":"Gina Prince-Bythewood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1650330/","name":"Sue Monk Kidd"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment.

I'm not against sequels mind you, but in most kids series seldom is any sequel as good as the first installment. This is the case for this past weekend's release starring the ever wacky Ben Stiller and his posse of celebrities. Yes my friends we take another trip back to the museum, for another hopefully fun adventure amidst it's hallowed halls. So sit back and read a late review of another Night at the Museum, the Secret of the Tomb. \n\nLikes: One thing I have always liked with this series is the selection of exhibits they choose to bring to life, and the integration of their personalities. This installment brings the magic early on, bringing back familiar faces like Teddy (Robin Williams), Jed (Owen Wilson), and Octavius (Steve Coogan) in all their comedic glory. Amidst a grand speech, cool CGI effects are put into effect to bring the constellations alive that shine in all their cool blue light before chaos arises. Once we get to the London museum, more exciting things come alive, in the form of another CGI fossil, a mythical snake demon made of metal, and the warrior with golden locks Lancelot (Dan Stevens). The effects are fluid, the designs beautiful, and when actually integrated into the movie, more on that later, you get the fun feeling you got in the first movie. Unfortunately most of these objects are background, aimlessly wandering around the scene while the big boys come out to play. \n\nOutside of the special effects there are some fun pokes at human society's obsessions, especially at internet videos, pop culture, and of course ridiculous habits that celebrities have. Some of these jokes are well timed, often delivered in a manner that is quite funny. However, many of the jokes, as happens most of the time, lose their charm and the lack of any witty humor makes it pretty much just mindless rambling that kids will only enjoy. Oh sure it's cute, but Hollywood needs to learn that more isn't necessary funnier, in fact it's the opposite. However, audiences allow them to get away with it, so what is the use in complaining. \n\nNow past funny, this Night at the Museum has another emotional side to it, helping to teach the moral lesson of moving on in the magical theatrical way. With the use of orchestrated symphony work, well angled camera shots, decent writing, and of course great acting, I'll admit I got that tingly feeling all over. No it's not gas, but those looking for a life lesson reminder will get it in this film, and a decent closing to the series  I think. As for acting, well Stiller gets the most screen time on this one. The verdict, it's alright  when he's not acting like a buffoon, and the man has some surprising agility and giant snake battle skills. Most of the time he is a bumbling idiot, but given enough time he can pull out some other feelings that we saw in Meet the Parents. As for Williams, may he rest in peace, the man gave one brilliant performance despite his character being diluted from its previous glory. \n\nDislikes: A lot in this category for this reviewer. It starts with the adventure, which in the third installment has been diluted to a rushed set of sequences, hastily edited together to get out in time for Christmas. A shame since the tale had promise of suspense, timing, and mystery that could have tied so many things together. Instead, the story lacked any depth, quickly revealing the secret without so much a trial, a challenge, or even an argument, it was just handed right to them and a rather lame story as well. In addition, a lot of the suspense was missing in this film, with only an irregular decay in the tablet's magic threatening our heroes. Speaking of which the cavalcade also lost their spunk, the strong willed character reduced to comedic boobs, some of which hardly utter a line, as Ben Stiller takes center stage.

Still, it is a cute film that kids will handle, and still holds a little of the spark that got me into the series. Worth a trip to the theater?

I'm not against sequels mind you, but in most kids series seldom is any sequel as good as the first installment. This is the case for this past weekend's release starring the ever wacky Ben Stiller and his posse of celebrities. Yes my friends we take another trip back to the museum, for another hopefully fun adventure amidst it's hallowed halls. So sit back and read a late review of another Night at the Museum, the Secret of the Tomb. \n\nLikes: One thing I have always liked with this series is the selection of exhibits they choose to bring to life, and the integration of their personalities. This installment brings the magic early on, bringing back familiar faces like Teddy (Robin Williams), Jed (Owen Wilson), and Octavius (Steve Coogan) in all their comedic glory. Amidst a grand speech, cool CGI effects are put into effect to bring the constellations alive that shine in all their cool blue light before chaos arises. Once we get to the London museum, more exciting things come alive, in the form of another CGI fossil, a mythical snake demon made of metal, and the warrior with golden locks Lancelot (Dan Stevens). The effects are fluid, the designs beautiful, and when actually integrated into the movie, more on that later, you get the fun feeling you got in the first movie. Unfortunately most of these objects are background, aimlessly wandering around the scene while the big boys come out to play. \n\nOutside of the special effects there are some fun pokes at human society's obsessions, especially at internet videos, pop culture, and of course ridiculous habits that celebrities have. Some of these jokes are well timed, often delivered in a manner that is quite funny. However, many of the jokes, as happens most of the time, lose their charm and the lack of any witty humor makes it pretty much just mindless rambling that kids will only enjoy. Oh sure it's cute, but Hollywood needs to learn that more isn't necessary funnier, in fact it's the opposite. However, audiences allow them to get away with it, so what is the use in complaining. \n\nNow past funny, this Night at the Museum has another emotional side to it, helping to teach the moral lesson of moving on in the magical theatrical way. With the use of orchestrated symphony work, well angled camera shots, decent writing, and of course great acting, I'll admit I got that tingly feeling all over. No it's not gas, but those looking for a life lesson reminder will get it in this film, and a decent closing to the series  I think. As for acting, well Stiller gets the most screen time on this one. The verdict, it's alright  when he's not acting like a buffoon, and the man has some surprising agility and giant snake battle skills. Most of the time he is a bumbling idiot, but given enough time he can pull out some other feelings that we saw in Meet the Parents. As for Williams, may he rest in peace, the man gave one brilliant performance despite his character being diluted from its previous glory. \n\nDislikes: A lot in this category for this reviewer. It starts with the adventure, which in the third installment has been diluted to a rushed set of sequences, hastily edited together to get out in time for Christmas. A shame since the tale had promise of suspense, timing, and mystery that could have tied so many things together. Instead, the story lacked any depth, quickly revealing the secret without so much a trial, a challenge, or even an argument, it was just handed right to them and a rather lame story as well. In addition, a lot of the suspense was missing in this film, with only an irregular decay in the tablet's magic threatening our heroes. Speaking of which the cavalcade also lost their spunk, the strong willed character reduced to comedic boobs, some of which hardly utter a line, as Ben Stiller takes center stage. Such a shame indeed, but your kids will get a kick out of the simplistic journey, that is if they can sit in there seats  which some chose not to. \n\nInstead the adventure was put aside for  comedy, or what passed for it in this movie. Yes there were a few zingers at first, but they quickly were lost to stupid rants of ridiculous arguing with his caveman doppleganger, stupid exchange of words with exhibits, and some rather awkward discussions with Rebel Wilson.

However if you are prepared to accept the film on just a surface level you will find yourself nicely entertained.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5568,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1987-01-16","keywords":"rape,neo noir,revenge,rape victim,hitchcockian","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi244564761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzAzOWYxNDYtY2M2Zi00YzMxLWIxNDItNmJiNjMyMDlkM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzAzOWYxNDYtY2M2Zi00YzMxLWIxNDItNmJiNjMyMDlkM2E1XkEyXkFqcGdeQWxiaWFtb250._V1_.jpg","description":"A young executive starts an affair with his boss's wife which then escalates into a nightmare after he lies to the police in order to protect her.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000430/","name":"Steve Guttenberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001527/","name":"Elizabeth McGovern","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001376/","name":"Isabelle Huppert"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000436/","name":"Curtis Hanson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046277/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0390159/","name":"Anne Holden","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000436/","name":"Curtis Hanson"],"duration":"PT1H52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The details on these things are terrific alone. And Chris Carter has also managed to create intense torture for the fans by forever dragging out the "Mulder and Scully in love" idea. People used to tune in to see when those two would kiss, and they had alot of fun with that, especially in the feature film. But a true sign of integrity for the show is the amount of truth in it. While the show is about the paranormal, and truth in it seems ironic, the show knows what the heck it's talking about. Every word from Scully's mouth is based on actual science. And unlike other FBI shows, The X-Files shows the FBI like it really is--not some tired cliche, but REAL people. And whenever someone, whether a fan or not, hears anything referring to aliens, they immediately think of little green men with small bodies, big heads, and large eyes...all courtesy of The X-Files. In short, this amazing television series has affected so many people. I feel blessed to have grown up with this show, rather than being born after it, doomed to see it in reruns.

The first one is a crime story, which constitutes the framework of the film. In the course of events, another theme appears - psychological experiences of the main character. Vivid blend of picture with sound and music will draw the audience into the deepest recesses of Marek's mind, making the viewers face questions: What is reality and what is only an illusion?

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 0805580, Title: Palimpsest, 
 --- Description: Palimpsest: Directed by Konrad Niewolski. With Andrzej Chyra, Magdalena Cielecka, Robert Gonera, Tomasz Sapryk. Marek, the main character of "Palimpsest," is a police inspector, a man on the verge of psychological disintegration trying to solve an intricate case. The story is told on two planes. The first one is a crime story, which constitutes the framework of the film. In the course of events, another theme appears - psychological experiences of the main character. Vivid blend of picture with sound and music will draw the audience into the deepest recesses of Marek's mind, making the viewers face questions: What is reality and what is only an illusion?

This movie is awful for young children, it's a dark movie with no happy moments of singing or general happiness:instead the movie contains death,attempts to harm animals ,broken family's ,loss of loved ones and will leave your child in tears.my 6yrold brother was deeply upset and troubled by this film and would not stop crying,this should NOT be a PG.a young child should not have to worry or think about death because even though it's a cartoon with a colourful cover this movie only contains heartbreaking moments with traumatic after affects on your young child.

Niestety, okazuje się, że nie ma ona nic wspólnego z rajem.

But what I truly enjoyed about this film is how the prince sees through the facade and figures out very quickly who the real designer is behind Rebecca Roslyn's designs. Not only does he obtain this information quickly, but he is not easily fooled in to thinking otherwise...and he is incredible supportive of someone who he views as an incredibly talented, hard working, under appreciated designer.\n\nWhen his group of friends intentionally trick Cindy in to underdressing for an event, the prince goes out of his way to try to make her feel comfortable by also dressing down. This isn't the only way he tries to build her up and make her feel comfortable...at one point in spite not being able to sew, he helps Cindy remake dresses for the ball under an extreme time crunch.

But what I truly enjoyed about this film is how the prince sees through the facade and figures out very quickly who the real designer is behind Rebecca Roslyn's designs. Not only does he obtain this information quickly, but he is not easily fooled in to thinking otherwise...and he is incredible supportive of someone who he views as an incredibly talented, hard working, under appreciated designer.\n\nWhen his group of friends intentionally trick Cindy in to underdressing for an event, the prince goes out of his way to try to make her feel comfortable by also dressing down. This isn't the only way he tries to build her up and make her feel comfortable...at one point in spite not being able to sew, he helps Cindy remake dresses for the ball under an extreme time crunch. He is really beyond too impossible to be true! But that is why we watch Hallmark, isn't it?

Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator, Eraser, the Governor of California) is Harry Tasker, a computer programming father by day, James Bond by night, working for a top secret government agency that is beyond the CIA and run by Charlton Heston. Tom Arnold, in his first dramatic role, plays Harry's partner, Gib, and is the smartass, class clown of the agency. Schwarzenegger and Arnold have a fantastic chemistry, creating the movie's biggest laughs. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Harry's under-appreciated wife, Helen, who flirts with the idea of leaving Harry for a used-car salesman, played with uber-confidence by Bill Paxson. Helen finds out the true identity of her husband in another funny scene where both are captured by Arab terrorists with help from a truth serum. The action part of True Lies comes from Harry trying to track down the nuclear bomb that has been stolen by the terrorists. A wonderfully shot escape scene on the bridge that connects the Florida Keys to the mainland is the pinnacle of True Lies. An action film that does not take itself too seriously (notice all of the silly Arnold-lines peppered throughout the movie, my personal favorite being "you're fired!" before Trump thought of it), True Lies is wildly entertaining, so much so that you almost forget Tom Arnold was married to Roseanne.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1994-07-15","keywords":"secret agent,spy,secret mission,remake,tango","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Lies","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi284754201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000130/","name":"Jamie Lee Curtis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000116/","name":"James Cameron"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956022/","name":"Claude Zidi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0584770/","name":"Simon Michaël"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436687/","name":"Didier Kaminka"}],"duration":"PT2H21M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It has a talking sponge that lives in a pineapple, flips burgers, and goes on nonsensical adventures with his slow-witted friend and neighbor. You either find it whimsical and funny or you don't. \n\nThis holds true for the second feature film Sponge Out of Water as we find our beloved residents of Bikini Bottom forced to enter our three dimensional world for the first time. After a flamboyant pirate (Antonio Banderas) manages to steal the much sought after secret Krabby Patty recipe using a magic book, Spongebob and co. have their world plunged into anarchy with the sudden loss of the greasy burgers.\n\nAs expected (if you watched the show as a kid), our heroes have to go on a series of misadventures to recover the secret recipe and stop the mischievous pirate after he commits industrial theft. \n\nThe thing your probably not expecting (if you've seen the trailer), is only a very small portion of this short film is actually 3D. It's not glaringly awful, and actually seems to work fairly well in a movie about abstract craziness that features time-traveling dolphins.\n\nIt's fun, plain and simple.

It has a talking sponge that lives in a pineapple, flips burgers, and goes on nonsensical adventures with his slow-witted friend and neighbor. You either find it whimsical and funny or you don't. \n\nThis holds true for the second feature film Sponge Out of Water as we find our beloved residents of Bikini Bottom forced to enter our three dimensional world for the first time. After a flamboyant pirate (Antonio Banderas) manages to steal the much sought after secret Krabby Patty recipe using a magic book, Spongebob and co. have their world plunged into anarchy with the sudden loss of the greasy burgers.\n\nAs expected (if you watched the show as a kid), our heroes have to go on a series of misadventures to recover the secret recipe and stop the mischievous pirate after he commits industrial theft. \n\nThe thing your probably not expecting (if you've seen the trailer), is only a very small portion of this short film is actually 3D. It's not glaringly awful, and actually seems to work fairly well in a movie about abstract craziness that features time-traveling dolphins.\n\nIt's fun, plain and simple. The children in the audience we're giggling with delight, the adults found humor enough to laugh, and all in all I appreciated the blatant references to movies like Mad Max, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and The Shining. It's a movie that is directed at children, but is enriched with plenty of adult humor in the form of puns and famous movies references. \n\nJust enjoy it for what it is and you won't be disappointed.

Arnold Schwarzenegger (Terminator, Eraser, the Governor of California) is Harry Tasker, a computer programming father by day, James Bond by night, working for a top secret government agency that is beyond the CIA and run by Charlton Heston. Tom Arnold, in his first dramatic role, plays Harry's partner, Gib, and is the smartass, class clown of the agency. Schwarzenegger and Arnold have a fantastic chemistry, creating the movie's biggest laughs. Jamie Lee Curtis plays Harry's under-appreciated wife, Helen, who flirts with the idea of leaving Harry for a used-car salesman, played with uber-confidence by Bill Paxson. Helen finds out the true identity of her husband in another funny scene where both are captured by Arab terrorists with help from a truth serum. The action part of True Lies comes from Harry trying to track down the nuclear bomb that has been stolen by the terrorists. A wonderfully shot escape scene on the bridge that connects the Florida Keys to the mainland is the pinnacle of True Lies. An action film that does not take itself too seriously (notice all of the silly Arnold-lines peppered throughout the movie, my personal favorite being "you're fired!" before Trump thought of it), True Lies is wildly entertaining, so much so that you almost forget Tom Arnold was married to Roseanne.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1994-07-15","keywords":"secret agent,spy,secret mission,remake,tango","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Lies","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi284754201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000130/","name":"Jamie Lee Curtis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000116/","name":"James Cameron"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956022/","name":"Claude Zidi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0584770/","name":"Simon Michaël"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436687/","name":"Didier Kaminka"}],"duration":"PT2H21M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

An action film that does not take itself too seriously (notice all of the silly Arnold-lines peppered throughout the movie, my personal favorite being "you're fired!" before Trump thought of it), True Lies is wildly entertaining, so much so that you almost forget Tom Arnold was married to Roseanne.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":249003,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1994-07-15","keywords":"secret agent,spy,secret mission,remake,tango","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"True Lies","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi284754201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2VjYzU2N2YtZDQ5Yy00MDhhLWJhNDItOWRiODUyZmU1MzJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000130/","name":"Jamie Lee Curtis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000792/","name":"Tom Arnold"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000116/","name":"James Cameron"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0038663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0956022/","name":"Claude Zidi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0584770/","name":"Simon Michaël","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0436687/","name":"Didier Kaminka"],"duration":"PT2H21M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <title lang="en">Fellwechselzeit</title>
    <desc lang="pl">Fellwechselzeit: Directed by Sabrina Mertens. With Zelda Espenschied, Miriam Schiweck, Freya Kreutzkam, Bernd Wolf. The still life of a family in 57 pictures. Germany in the 1970ies. Stephanie is an intelligent and lively child. But she leads an isolated life with her parents, marked by the symbiotic bonding with her mentally unstable mother. A mother who has never really left her own childhood behind and who lives amidst things of the past and the memories connected to them. Stephanie's relationship with her father is one of mistrust.

So he goes to a remote island to learn a whistling language that will allow him to communicate with the criminals from a distance. There he rekindles a relationship with his old flame and his priorities change. As both the criminals and his colleagues are onto Cristi what choices will he make to come out clean of his predicament? A clever game of cops and robbers ensues.\n\nSumming up this multi layered, not always coherent plot, is not an easy task. THE WHISTLERS takes a long time to get going but it's many elements come together building up to something special. Heavy on movie references it is heavily inspired by Tarantino movies, although the style of the cinematography is rather dull.\n\nThe script on paper must look great, but this is the case where a writer should let go of his work and let someone else direct. Cornelliu Porumboiu helmed 13 films but seems to be still searching for his directing style. While all the cast do their job well, the motives of their characters for the majority of the film are obscure to say the least.\n\nBut if this is the originality you are looking for THE WHISTLERS is for you. With good timing and a genuine sense of wit it is a rewarding experience for those who will stick with it until the end.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-13","keywords":"female rear nudity,canary islands,police detective,policeman,police officer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1044168473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyOWU0MWYtY2IzZS00ZWMwLThkMDgtYWU5MDA2MjVmMWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyOWU0MWYtY2IzZS00ZWMwLThkMDgtYWU5MDA2MjVmMWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412096/","name":"Vlad Ivanov"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5054840/","name":"Catrinel Marlon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120715/","name":"Rodica Lazar"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1717949/","name":"Corneliu Porumboiu"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0180401/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167020/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245364/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1717949/","name":"Corneliu Porumboiu"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So he goes to a remote island to learn a whistling language that will allow him to communicate with the criminals from a distance. There he rekindles a relationship with his old flame and his priorities change. As both the criminals and his colleagues are onto Cristi what choices will he make to come out clean of his predicament? A clever game of cops and robbers ensues.\n\nSumming up this multi layered, not always coherent plot, is not an easy task. THE WHISTLERS takes a long time to get going but it's many elements come together building up to something special. Heavy on movie references it is heavily inspired by Tarantino movies, although the style of the cinematography is rather dull.\n\nThe script on paper must look great, but this is the case where a writer should let go of his work and let someone else direct. Cornelliu Porumboiu helmed 13 films but seems to be still searching for his directing style. While all the cast do their job well, the motives of their characters for the majority of the film are obscure to say the least.\n\nBut if this is the originality you are looking for THE WHISTLERS is for you. With good timing and a genuine sense of wit it is a rewarding experience for those who will stick with it until the end.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-13","keywords":"female rear nudity,canary islands,police detective,policeman,police officer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1044168473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyOWU0MWYtY2IzZS00ZWMwLThkMDgtYWU5MDA2MjVmMWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyOWU0MWYtY2IzZS00ZWMwLThkMDgtYWU5MDA2MjVmMWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412096/","name":"Vlad Ivanov","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5054840/","name":"Catrinel Marlon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120715/","name":"Rodica Lazar"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1717949/","name":"Corneliu Porumboiu"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0180401/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167020/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245364/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1717949/","name":"Corneliu Porumboiu"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Heavy on movie references it is heavily inspired by Tarantino movies, although the style of the cinematography is rather dull.\n\nThe script on paper must look great, but this is the case where a writer should let go of his work and let someone else direct. Cornelliu Porumboiu helmed 13 films but seems to be still searching for his directing style. While all the cast do their job well, the motives of their characters for the majority of the film are obscure to say the least.\n\nBut if this is the originality you are looking for THE WHISTLERS is for you. With good timing and a genuine sense of wit it is a rewarding experience for those who will stick with it until the end.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5114,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-09-13","keywords":"female rear nudity,canary islands,police detective,policeman,police officer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1044168473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyOWU0MWYtY2IzZS00ZWMwLThkMDgtYWU5MDA2MjVmMWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGIyOWU0MWYtY2IzZS00ZWMwLThkMDgtYWU5MDA2MjVmMWEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412096/","name":"Vlad Ivanov","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5054840/","name":"Catrinel Marlon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1120715/","name":"Rodica Lazar"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1717949/","name":"Corneliu Porumboiu"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0180401/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0167020/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245364/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1717949/","name":"Corneliu Porumboiu"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The owner, Nathan, pretty much created a search engine but he's gone a step further by creating an artificial intelligent woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) who the programmer is supposed to examine and question.\n\nEX MACHINA pretty much came out of nowhere and became a good hit across the world and I'm rather shocked that it did. Usually dumb science fiction movies with a lot of mindless actions are the ones that make money and not those that features very little to no action and instead just dialogue and thought. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it asks more questions than anything else and it expects the viewer to think about those questions and the impact that certain actions could have.\n\nThe visual style of the film is quite impressive and it's certainly a very interesting film to just look at. The music score is quite haunting and perfectly captures the mood of the film. There's the terrific cinematography that pulls you into the setting. The special effects are also extremely impressive. I loved the set and the look of this compound but the special effects are the real star. If you didn't believe that you were really looking at and operating with real artificial intelligent creatures then the entire film just wouldn't have the same feeling.\n\nThen there are the performances, which are a major plus. Gleeson pretty much plays the role that is typically a nerd but the film never lowers the character to that simple term and instead makes him a very interesting person. Even the role of the billionaire played by Isaac isn't what you'd typically see and the actor brings a certainly coldness to the part. Vikander is flawless and steals the picture in her role.\n\nEX MACHINA certainly won't be a movie for everyone but it's good to think about the questions that it asks."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":507744,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-21","keywords":"artificial intelligence,turing test,minimal cast,robot,robot human relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi744337689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young programmer is selected to participate in a breakthrough experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breathtaking female A.I.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2539953/","name":"Alicia Vikander"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1727304/","name":"Domhnall Gleeson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390816/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A young programmer is selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment in synthetic intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a highly advanced humanoid A.I." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0470752/","name":"Ex Machina","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUxNzc0OTIxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDI3NzU2NDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young programmer is selected to participate in a ground-breaking experiment in synthetic intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a highly advanced humanoid A.I.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0470752/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Michael_Elliott","dateCreated":"2015-09-25","inLanguage":"English","name":"A Different Sort of Picture","reviewBody":"Ex Machina (2015) \n\n*** 1/2 (out of 4) \n\nA different sort of science fiction film, a programmer (Domhnall Gleeson) wins what is basically a lottery to go and spend a week with his company's owner (Oscar Isaac). The owner, Nathan, pretty much created a search engine but he's gone a step further by creating an artificial intelligent woman named Ava (Alicia Vikander) who the programmer is supposed to examine and question.\n\nEX MACHINA pretty much came out of nowhere and became a good hit across the world and I'm rather shocked that it did. Usually dumb science fiction movies with a lot of mindless actions are the ones that make money and not those that features very little to no action and instead just dialogue and thought. What really sets this film apart is the fact that it asks more questions than anything else and it expects the viewer to think about those questions and the impact that certain actions could have.\n\nThe visual style of the film is quite impressive and it's certainly a very interesting film to just look at. The music score is quite haunting and perfectly captures the mood of the film. There's the terrific cinematography that pulls you into the setting. The special effects are also extremely impressive. I loved the set and the look of this compound but the special effects are the real star. If you didn't believe that you were really looking at and operating with real artificial intelligent creatures then the entire film just wouldn't have the same feeling.\n\nThen there are the performances, which are a major plus. Gleeson pretty much plays the role that is typically a nerd but the film never lowers the character to that simple term and instead makes him a very interesting person. Even the role of the billionaire played by Isaac isn't what you'd typically see and the actor brings a certainly coldness to the part. Vikander is flawless and steals the picture in her role.\n\nEX MACHINA certainly won't be a movie for everyone but it's good to think about the questions that it asks.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":507744,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-01-21","keywords":"artificial intelligence,turing test,minimal cast,robot,robot human relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"New Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi744337689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTUyMjQzNzk0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE4NjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young programmer is selected to participate in a breakthrough experiment in artificial intelligence by evaluating the human qualities of a breathtaking female A.I.\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2539953/","name":"Alicia Vikander","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1727304/","name":"Domhnall Gleeson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1209966/","name":"Oscar Isaac"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0390816/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307497/","name":"Alex Garland"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Rock played a real good part and he certainly has a bright future in the acting industry. The beautiful Kelly Hu showed that she can be good on the big screen and the ever reliable Michael Clarke Duncan played a great part as well. The action scenes were hard hitting and brutal and the scenery was fantastic as well.\n\nThe only thing that spoiled the film for me was the fact that it was not an original idea. The plot has been done in so many movies before. Sometimes in the movie world, certain plots are churned out time and time again and you just get that feeling of deja vu. The plot for this film has been done in dozens of movies and countless TV shows.\n\nI saw this film with a friend of mine and he really really enjoyed it. However, he usually likes cop movies and hasn't seen many fantasy adventure movies so watching this was a first for him. I have seen dozens of movies like this and whilst it was very good, I did get that feeling of familiarity.\n\nBut anyway, I still recommend it. The fight scenes are awesome and there are some funny scenes in it. And again, the Rock does have a future as an actor. I just hope that his next project is a fresh idea.\n\nI'm going to really be awkward here but there's three other things that bothered me about this movie.

The Rock played a real good part and he certainly has a bright future in the acting industry. The beautiful Kelly Hu showed that she can be good on the big screen and the ever reliable Michael Clarke Duncan played a great part as well. The action scenes were hard hitting and brutal and the scenery was fantastic as well.\n\nThe only thing that spoiled the film for me was the fact that it was not an original idea. The plot has been done in so many movies before. Sometimes in the movie world, certain plots are churned out time and time again and you just get that feeling of deja vu. The plot for this film has been done in dozens of movies and countless TV shows.\n\nI saw this film with a friend of mine and he really really enjoyed it. However, he usually likes cop movies and hasn't seen many fantasy adventure movies so watching this was a first for him. I have seen dozens of movies like this and whilst it was very good, I did get that feeling of familiarity.\n\nBut anyway, I still recommend it. The fight scenes are awesome and there are some funny scenes in it. And again, the Rock does have a future as an actor. I just hope that his next project is a fresh idea.\n\nI'm going to really be awkward here but there's three other things that bothered me about this movie. There was a short scene with an Indian elephant in. Did ancient Egypt have elephants? I'm no wildlife expert but I didn't think they did. Secondly, wasn't it amazing that there was such a variety of accents in the film. Lastly, gunpowder in ancient Egypt? No way!\n\nI'm just getting old though-watch and enjoy!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":135123,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-04-19","keywords":"sorceress,desert,king,showdown,shared universe","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0104526/","name":"Steven Brand","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003817/","name":"Michael Clarke Duncan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751080/","name":"Chuck Russell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075836/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0814085/","name":"Stephen Sommers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0355054/","name":"Jonathan Hales","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0651758/","name":"William Osborne"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When calling a client from a phone booth in the hope of getting her to a hotel.  When he hangs up the phone rings and he answers to what he assumes is a prank call.  However the caller reveals more and more about Stu exposing his lies.  When Stu tries to leave the caller reveals that he has Stu pinned down with a sniper rifle and the death of a man by the booth proves it.  The police arrive and surround Stu while the caller continues his game.\n\nEveryone knows that it had a small budget, a shooting window of just over a week and that it was made years ago and shelved as Farrell's star power increased and real life terrorist attacks and snipers came and went in the media and the mind of the American public.  So I'll not dwell on that and instead talk of the film!  The pitch was enough to get me interested  `man is held in phone box by sniper'  sounds great!  I really wanted to see this film but was put off by the trailer, but not of the films I saw wrong in the trailer were to the detriment of the film as over 80-odd minutes it really runs like a race horse.\n\nStarting with humour and a free-flowing pace it turns sinister early on but keeps the pace.  In terms of plot it has many good twists and turns that will keep you interested and on the edge of your seat.  The only issue for me was accepting why the sniper was doing it and how he was able to get access to the equipment he would have needed as well as the information  not to mention the WILL to do it!  Also little things bugged me, but the film carries itself over these obstacles well enough and reservations are soon forgotten.  It sounds simple but the simple ideas work best and, although low on action (sorry, teen boys!) it is driven by dialogue and simply not knowing what will come next.\n\nThe direction helps the film by constantly moving and using split screens etc to give the impression that a lot is going on at once  again making the film feel like it has a fast pace.  It feels a little gimmicky (especially now that we've had 2 series of 24 doing the same thing) but it works regardless.  I wrote in an old review (8mm I think) that I would never pay to see a Joel Schumacher film ever again, and I DIDN'T pay to see Phone Booth!  However I was surprised because he didn't ruin it!  He did a good job  yes,  you heard me!  His usual excesses seem to have been controlled by a good producer and editing team and the film works  much to my surprise and relief!\n\nFarrell may not be a bona-fide Hollywood star yet but he takes the task of being onscreen for almost the whole film and runs with it.  He makes a comically cruel character someone that reveals himself to be a loser but never loses the audience  and that takes talent.  Sutherland's voice on the trailer didn't work for me (too normal and slow) but in the film he is excellent, like the director said, no-one else could have done the role, he is right for it.  Whitaker makes up the third lead and he holds his corner well.\n\nIt may not be without the odd flaw but this film manages to be simple, gripping and very effective.

Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":616031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1995-12-15","keywords":"gun battle,armored car robbery,gunfight,organized crime,honor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Heat: Director's Definitive Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi664516889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdjMDhhNWMtNWQ3ZS00YTY1LTgzYjQtYmU1YjAzYmI2NGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdjMDhhNWMtNWQ3ZS00YTY1LTgzYjQtYmU1YjAzYmI2NGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Clip: Splits"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000174/","name":"Val Kilmer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035930/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"}],"duration":"PT2H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":616031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1995-12-15","keywords":"gun battle,armored car robbery,gunfight,organized crime,honor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Heat: Director's Definitive Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi664516889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdjMDhhNWMtNWQ3ZS00YTY1LTgzYjQtYmU1YjAzYmI2NGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdjMDhhNWMtNWQ3ZS00YTY1LTgzYjQtYmU1YjAzYmI2NGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Clip: Splits","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000174/","name":"Val Kilmer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035930/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"],"duration":"PT2H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Rob asks at the very beginning of the film and it is here that Rob decides to investigate just how he is at fault to the 5 all time greatest break ups in his love life a la The Top 5s he and his co-horts in crime habitually categorize all things pertinent to music.  What follows is a laugh-filled introspection of the heart on its sleeve and its tongue sharply in cheek as to Rob's quest of finding all his faults and foibles in hope of wooing back his recent romantic dismissal that includes 5 prototypes of all heterosexual men: The First Kiss/Crush; The Adolescent Urgency/Loss of Virginity, The Woman Out of His League; The Rebound Best Friend/Possible Soul Mate and finally, The One True Love He Isn't Even Aware Of.\n\nThe approach may seem old hat and gimmicky (Cusack breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly into the camera) yet it isn't intrusive but enlightening into what the hero is really thinking and more importantly why.  Surrounded by a truly winning cast, Cusack shines once again as a likable average guy who is trying to remain a guy although the inner voice of Be A Man is palpable and reverberating inside.  His nonchalant, casual way of speaking and his slow burns are priceless (he finally takes out his frustrations on Laura's new beau, the unctious sensitive pony-tailed Ian played by Cusack's best bud and former co-star of `The Sure Thing' and the cult classic `Tapeheads', Robbins, in the film's funniest fantasy sequence of Rob, Barry and Dick pummeling Ian to death). Cusack's constant streak of the smart alecky good guy continues from the quintessential portrait of Lloyd Dobler, kickboxing student of the affairs of the heart in the classic `Say Anything.' and the previous purveyor of romantic comedy, Walter `Gib' Gibson in the update of `It Happened One Night', `The Sure Thing' to his hit-man Martin Blank pondering his high school reunion with dread in the black comedy  `Grosse Pointe Blank' (reunited here with his screenwriters/partners in crime D.V. De Vincentis, Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg).\n\nThe women portraying Rob's Girlfriends of Christmas Past , so to speak, are exemplery especially Taylor (another Cusack repertoire player, who played his best gal pal/voice of reason in `Anything.') as Sarah the rebound fling and Zeta-Jones as Charlie (showing some nice moments of sublime sardonicism), the sexy babe completely out of his element). Bonet has a few nice moments as local singer Marie De Salle who provides some unsubtle ways of bringing Rob to his senses.

Rob asks at the very beginning of the film and it is here that Rob decides to investigate just how he is at fault to the 5 all time greatest break ups in his love life a la The Top 5s he and his co-horts in crime habitually categorize all things pertinent to music.  What follows is a laugh-filled introspection of the heart on its sleeve and its tongue sharply in cheek as to Rob's quest of finding all his faults and foibles in hope of wooing back his recent romantic dismissal that includes 5 prototypes of all heterosexual men: The First Kiss/Crush; The Adolescent Urgency/Loss of Virginity, The Woman Out of His League; The Rebound Best Friend/Possible Soul Mate and finally, The One True Love He Isn't Even Aware Of.\n\nThe approach may seem old hat and gimmicky (Cusack breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly into the camera) yet it isn't intrusive but enlightening into what the hero is really thinking and more importantly why.  Surrounded by a truly winning cast, Cusack shines once again as a likable average guy who is trying to remain a guy although the inner voice of Be A Man is palpable and reverberating inside.  His nonchalant, casual way of speaking and his slow burns are priceless (he finally takes out his frustrations on Laura's new beau, the unctious sensitive pony-tailed Ian played by Cusack's best bud and former co-star of `The Sure Thing' and the cult classic `Tapeheads', Robbins, in the film's funniest fantasy sequence of Rob, Barry and Dick pummeling Ian to death). Cusack's constant streak of the smart alecky good guy continues from the quintessential portrait of Lloyd Dobler, kickboxing student of the affairs of the heart in the classic `Say Anything.' and the previous purveyor of romantic comedy, Walter `Gib' Gibson in the update of `It Happened One Night', `The Sure Thing' to his hit-man Martin Blank pondering his high school reunion with dread in the black comedy  `Grosse Pointe Blank' (reunited here with his screenwriters/partners in crime D.V. De Vincentis, Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg).\n\nThe women portraying Rob's Girlfriends of Christmas Past , so to speak, are exemplery especially Taylor (another Cusack repertoire player, who played his best gal pal/voice of reason in `Anything.') as Sarah the rebound fling and Zeta-Jones as Charlie (showing some nice moments of sublime sardonicism), the sexy babe completely out of his element). Bonet has a few nice moments as local singer Marie De Salle who provides some unsubtle ways of bringing Rob to his senses.  Sister Joan provides some comic bile as well as mutual friend to Laura and Rob. But frankly it's a guy's flick and thanks to the boisterous Black (late of HBO's comedy series `Tenacious D' and a score of films as diverse as `Mars Attacks!' and last year's co-starring with Cusack in  `Cradle Will Rock') and geeky, quiet Louiso adding some color especially in their scenes together debating their varied choices of musical tastes.\n\nDirected by Stephen Frears, a fellow Englishman who appears to know the American arcana striking a responsive chord (he put Cusack through the paces in the neo-noir classic `The Grifters' a decade ago) allows his characters time to pace themselves from one setup to the next and skillfully keeps the smart patter gleaned from the book alive on screen.\n\nEasily one of the year's funniest films and finally  a film I whole heartedly recommend in what seemed to be dearth of mediocrity thus far in the new millennium.

If you're a Star Wars geek this movie totally is for you. Basically it's a movie about Star Wars geeks made by Star Wars geeks for a target audience of Star Wars geeks. If you are not into all things Star Wars this movie may well miss the mark with you. And even the most rabid of Star Wars fans would have to concede that the movie is certainly not anything spectacular. It's fairly charming and reasonably amusing but never really riotously funny. But it works. More or less.\n\nThe movie is set in the autumn of 1998, a time before Jar Jar Binks had been foisted upon the world. Four friends, major Star Wars geeks all, decide to drive across the country, break into Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of The Phantom Menace. The major motivation for this journey is that one of the friends has cancer and will not live to see the movie released. But once that is established the cancer storyline is basically put on the back burner and this turns into a mostly predictable wacky road-trip comedy. Some of the wackiness works, some of it falls flat. There are a bunch of celebrity cameos thrown in, some of which are inspired and some of which are rather random and pointless. So it's a movie which has its ups and downs. But it's enjoyable more often than not and the movie breezes by in a nice, tight, well-paced 90 minutes.\n\nNone of the actors playing our gang of four really stand out in any memorable way. Dan Fogler's character is a little more outrageous than the others but that's about it. But the group works together well and they are ably supported by the varied cast of characters who pop up throughout. Seth Rogen's portrayal of a pimp is one of the standouts. Of course this ode to Star Wars fans wouldn't be complete without taking some shots at Trekkies. So there's room for another funny turn by an actor portraying Admiral Seasholtz, an uber-Trekkie. Who is the unrecognizable actor memorably bringing this character to life? You may have to wait until the closing credits roll to figure it out. And in this Star Wars geek universe there's room for one girl and Kristen Bell is both charming and funny in the role as her character gets swept along for the ride. Could the movie be a little more consistently funny? Most definitely. But the movie about Star Wars geeks will probably leave you with a smile on your face. Especially if you're a Star Wars geek yourself.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2009-02-13","keywords":"star wars fan film,blonde,princess lela bikini,white panties,scantily clad female","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fanboys","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3468690201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmODc3N2UtNzc0Ny00YWU4LTljYWEtMDNjNmQzNDJhY2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmODc3N2UtNzc0Ny00YWU4LTljYWEtMDNjNmQzNDJhY2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer: A group of anxious fans decide to break into Skywalker Ranch and steal an early print of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" for their friend who is suffering from cancer."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283945/","name":"Dan Fogler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059431/","name":"Jay Baruchel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068338/","name":"Kristen Bell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1381100/","name":"Kyle Newman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148949/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0244605/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2094392/","name":"Ernest Cline"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1104057/","name":"Adam F.

If you're a Star Wars geek this movie totally is for you. Basically it's a movie about Star Wars geeks made by Star Wars geeks for a target audience of Star Wars geeks. If you are not into all things Star Wars this movie may well miss the mark with you. And even the most rabid of Star Wars fans would have to concede that the movie is certainly not anything spectacular. It's fairly charming and reasonably amusing but never really riotously funny. But it works. More or less.\n\nThe movie is set in the autumn of 1998, a time before Jar Jar Binks had been foisted upon the world. Four friends, major Star Wars geeks all, decide to drive across the country, break into Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of The Phantom Menace. The major motivation for this journey is that one of the friends has cancer and will not live to see the movie released. But once that is established the cancer storyline is basically put on the back burner and this turns into a mostly predictable wacky road-trip comedy. Some of the wackiness works, some of it falls flat. There are a bunch of celebrity cameos thrown in, some of which are inspired and some of which are rather random and pointless. So it's a movie which has its ups and downs. But it's enjoyable more often than not and the movie breezes by in a nice, tight, well-paced 90 minutes.\n\nNone of the actors playing our gang of four really stand out in any memorable way. Dan Fogler's character is a little more outrageous than the others but that's about it. But the group works together well and they are ably supported by the varied cast of characters who pop up throughout. Seth Rogen's portrayal of a pimp is one of the standouts. Of course this ode to Star Wars fans wouldn't be complete without taking some shots at Trekkies. So there's room for another funny turn by an actor portraying Admiral Seasholtz, an uber-Trekkie. Who is the unrecognizable actor memorably bringing this character to life? You may have to wait until the closing credits roll to figure it out. And in this Star Wars geek universe there's room for one girl and Kristen Bell is both charming and funny in the role as her character gets swept along for the ride. Could the movie be a little more consistently funny? Most definitely. But the movie about Star Wars geeks will probably leave you with a smile on your face. Especially if you're a Star Wars geek yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2009-02-13","keywords":"star wars fan film,blonde,princess lela bikini,white panties,scantily clad female","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fanboys","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3468690201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmODc3N2UtNzc0Ny00YWU4LTljYWEtMDNjNmQzNDJhY2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmODc3N2UtNzc0Ny00YWU4LTljYWEtMDNjNmQzNDJhY2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer: A group of anxious fans decide to break into Skywalker Ranch and steal an early print of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" for their friend who is suffering from cancer.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283945/","name":"Dan Fogler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059431/","name":"Jay Baruchel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068338/","name":"Kristen Bell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1381100/","name":"Kyle Newman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148949/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0244605/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2094392/","name":"Ernest Cline","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1104057/","name":"Adam F.

This is a bizarre film, unnecessarily complicated, that assembles a top-notch cast, puts them into a tense situation with all the players in place, and then has nothing to do with them. It's like the writer forgot that you needed a third act; it's all rising action with no denouement.\n\nWashington plays Det. Frazier, a hostage negotiator who acts, literally, as if this is his first case. He has the obligatory younger partner (Chiwetel Ejiofor, "Serenity") who exists so Frazier can explain his theories and the obligatory ESU commander who wants to go in and shoot everyone (Willem Dafoe, sadly underused). Owen plays the bank robber, about whom frustratingly nothing is known except what he said into the camera in the trailer. Finally, Foster plays some sort of player amongst the Powers That Be who walks into the mayor's office, demands an update, and is given "every possible courtesy", etc. She serves no purpose whatsoever, not even in a clichéd action movie type of way like Dafoe and Ejiofor. The performances are the only good part of the movie, but there are times when you can tell that the actors wished they were in a better film. They're giving it their all, and they're getting no help from anyone else involved.\n\nSpike Lee is up to his usual tricks here, which, in this type of movie, is a very bad thing. The details of the heist itself I won't disclose. I can't. The action is, at best, vague - extremely brief scenes of vaults opening, hole-digging, hostage roughing up, and the usual bank-robber stuff are all the details we really get. It is also inter cut with scenes of the hostages recalling the heist; their recollections serve no purpose except to confuse the audience further. "Inside Man" is curiously racist: the white crooks rough up the black bank customers, the white Foster and the mayor order around Washington, the white cops mistake a Sikh for an Arab and beat him, and even a Jewish hostage was not only a lawyer, but has a nephew who is a jeweler. Washington and Ejiofor are given no flaws whatsoever and are seen mostly being pushed around by everyone else in the movie. The action repeatedly grinds to a halt so Lee can insert quirky little subplots involving video games, Washington's much younger girlfriend and random Albanian women. They're at best unnecessary, at worst, disastrous. If we had been given a director with more focus, there is the feeling that this could have been a lean, mean thriller. But it drags and drags and drags and when we get to the end, we understand why the film stalled for so long: the ending is about as climatic as erectile dysfunction.\n\n"Inside Man" looked like it had it all - great cast, good concept, reputable director, but the end result is a near-disaster. It's like someone threw "Dog Day Afternoon" into a blender, drank it, and vomited it back onto the screen. As I stumbled out of the theater, deprived of my money and time, I cursed the screen gods who thought to tease me with such an improbably bad movie. I thought back to a better day, when a movie at least knew what was going on even if the audience didn't, gave us characters who seemed like actual people and served actual purposes to the plot, so that even if we had to wait until the Big Twist to answer our questions, we at least had a reason to still care."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"}],"duration":"PT2H9M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I thought back to a better day, when a movie at least knew what was going on even if the audience didn't, gave us characters who seemed like actual people and served actual purposes to the plot, so that even if we had to wait until the Big Twist to answer our questions, we at least had a reason to still care.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":356059,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2006-06-28","keywords":"bank,bank robber,hostage,robber,negotiation","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Inside Man","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi495889689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWMwYjE0MDItYjA4Zi00NTMyLWI5NWItZDA2ZjQ5MWRhMzRlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Inside Man","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0654110/","name":"Clive Owen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000149/","name":"Jodie Foster"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000490/","name":"Spike Lee"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1897957/","name":"Russell Gewirtz"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Neel Sethi plays the main character, Mowgli in the movie. He is the only human being on screen and as his first ever role, this kid actor is truly magnificent. He is as good as any kid actor has ever been, even favorably compared to Haley Joel Osment in The Sixth Sense. The computer generated imagery is brilliant all throughout, definitely some of the best ever and the 3D is just mind blowing. In every single scene I kept getting surprised and thrilled at just how amazing the CGI and 3D were. I think the main reason as to why this movie worked it's because it also has a very good story line that's mixed in with the amazing visuals. Also, the voice actors are all perfectly cast. Especially Idris Elba as Shere Khan, who is truly haunting in every scene he's in. That was one well made and scary villain that Mowgli had to face. Jon Favreau did a fantastic work with this movie, cause really this story has been told many times before, and yet this movie feels fresh and interesting nonetheless. I'm glad that it's doing so well in Box Office because it completely deserves it.

Each of the voice actors do a wonderful job playing their characters, the standouts are Ginnifer Goodwin who plays a really likable and relatable character and Jason Bateman who plays a character that is at fist unlikable but manages to improve throughout the film. This is not your typical kids film, it doesn't have the bathroom jokes like in most kids films. The script is smartly written and uses the message effectively unlike others which beats you over the head with theirs.\n\nZootopia is one of my favorite films of the year, if you haven't seen it, give it a chance it's not your typical kids film which is what I like, I just wish more of them were like this.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":462584,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-03-03","keywords":"anthropomorphic animal,con artist,rabbit,police,mammal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi934327577","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODk1Mjk4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc4OTk1NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEwODk1Mjk4OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjc4OTk1NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the animal city of Zootopia, a fast-talking fox who's trying to make it big goes on the run when he's framed for a crime he didn't commit.

It always had the ingredients for a fascinating study of human behaviour. Its conductor Dr. Philip Zimbardo knew that, it just had to be played out. Of course, The Stanford Prison Experiment is a story that's been notably portrayed before, such as the 2001 German film Das Experiment. I remember being a fan of it when I first saw it, but I admit I can't quite recall it enough to make a comparison here. Nevertheless, this American version which doesn't make substitutions is a preferable version, one that makes resourceful use of today's technology and young talent. There's a dual study going on here. One, the part that writes itself, a document of the actual experiment. And the other, an examination of the ethics of the experimenters. Here is the ugly side of the human condition and our desires to push one another to feel the sweet taste of superiority.\n\nWhile it may lend the obvious yet compelling results of what imaginary power and authority does to people, it still needs to be well executed to work. Fortunately director Kyle Patrick Alvarez and writer Tim Talbott have the right handling of the material, working with great economy in balancing its dichotomy's. At first it's disarmingly casual in the way the volunteers are selected and summoned, making a point of its randomizations and often offering an endearing and natural sense of humour. While superficially bleak, it's having fun with the 70s clothes and oversized moustaches, without peeling back their integrity. But then real tension, real anguish, and a real sensation of danger and dread creeps in and The Stanford Prison Experiment becomes deeply unsettling in its dehumanization techniques. With a careful sense from Alvarez of how far to escalate each sequence, it rings true to human sensibilities of what would happen in this unique situation. There's always a reminder that it isn't real, but it doesn't stop you from feeling unbearably trapped. This is nature at work, combined with a touch of modern cruelty.\n\nThere is a tendency in the film's inherent and forgivably episodic narrative that it gets you attached to a character they're focusing on only due to their upcoming exit. Thereby the film loses steam bit by bit. It gradually wins you back afterwards, but each time it takes a little longer. Ezra Miller in particular is a highlight of the first half of the film, formulating some of the most memorable instances of the prisoner's rebellions and reluctances. He's missed, but his absence only breeds more tension and vulnerability as we're left with weaker willed volunteers. If anything, this film is an impressive display of the best talent from the next generation of actors. Hopefully all to soon be familiar faces; Johnny Simmons, Tye Sheridan, Brett Davern, and a guard with the most inventive choice of wording, Michael Angarano, all stick out among other strong performances. While a crowded ensemble does mean no character gets to be fleshed out to their full potential, Alvarez and Talbott at least give room for everyone a time to shine without any dim spots.\n\nOn the experimenters end, Billy Crudup is perfect casting as Dr. Zimbardo. Donning a beard that gives him an uncanny resemblance to Satan, it doesn't remove that trustworthy glint of compassion in his eyes. His usual warmth is countered by his malicious intent to shove the volunteers to their limits and it creates an enthralling inner conflict where he's finding his own limits. The film admittedly does lack a female presence giving the nature of 24 volunteers and all the scientists being men. Its only example is Olivia Thirlby as Zimbardo's girlfriend who later involves herself in the experiment and becomes a voice of reason, but a very welcome one. It may have blind spots and a few stumbles, but it doesn't hinder what the film does right. As I was completely wrapped in its deft and dense confrontations, I kept waiting for the film to explode. Perhaps recalling the more gritty approach Das Experiment took to its second half, instead this implodes, which is a much more restrained and satisfying conclusion to watch these invisible social constructs dissolve rather than erupt.\n\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment's wealth of strong material and performances are matched by its technical ambitions. The slick photography makes it cinematic with liberal collages of close-ups and swift camera moves but still keeping it intimate. When the scene calls for rigid obedience, any time the camera moves out of line we hold our breath. It's graded with a washed-out atmosphere, relishing in the moody darkness. I've been irritated with indie films that abuse a shallow depth of field in their photography for no good reason, but this film uses it to isolate you in its grasp and as a result the film shook me up for the rest of the day. While it gets under the skin of the prisoners and the scientists, I did find myself wanting to get behind the motivations of the guards, the most vocal contributors of the experiment. Instead, thats saved for an epilogue that feels like a wise afterthought, but it's a powerful note on the personal experiments we run just because the opportunity is there. The Stanford Prison Experiment is an ideal taut psychological thriller that bristles with youthful energy and will mostly likely remain standing as one of the best of the year.\n\n8/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41130,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-07-17","keywords":"prisoner,guard,prison,psychology,university","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi739618841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU4MDQwNDc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMzg5NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU4MDQwNDc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMzg5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It is the summer of 1971.

While a crowded ensemble does mean no character gets to be fleshed out to their full potential, Alvarez and Talbott at least give room for everyone a time to shine without any dim spots.\n\nOn the experimenters end, Billy Crudup is perfect casting as Dr. Zimbardo. Donning a beard that gives him an uncanny resemblance to Satan, it doesn't remove that trustworthy glint of compassion in his eyes. His usual warmth is countered by his malicious intent to shove the volunteers to their limits and it creates an enthralling inner conflict where he's finding his own limits. The film admittedly does lack a female presence giving the nature of 24 volunteers and all the scientists being men. Its only example is Olivia Thirlby as Zimbardo's girlfriend who later involves herself in the experiment and becomes a voice of reason, but a very welcome one. It may have blind spots and a few stumbles, but it doesn't hinder what the film does right. As I was completely wrapped in its deft and dense confrontations, I kept waiting for the film to explode. Perhaps recalling the more gritty approach Das Experiment took to its second half, instead this implodes, which is a much more restrained and satisfying conclusion to watch these invisible social constructs dissolve rather than erupt.\n\nThe Stanford Prison Experiment's wealth of strong material and performances are matched by its technical ambitions. The slick photography makes it cinematic with liberal collages of close-ups and swift camera moves but still keeping it intimate. When the scene calls for rigid obedience, any time the camera moves out of line we hold our breath. It's graded with a washed-out atmosphere, relishing in the moody darkness. I've been irritated with indie films that abuse a shallow depth of field in their photography for no good reason, but this film uses it to isolate you in its grasp and as a result the film shook me up for the rest of the day. While it gets under the skin of the prisoners and the scientists, I did find myself wanting to get behind the motivations of the guards, the most vocal contributors of the experiment. Instead, thats saved for an epilogue that feels like a wise afterthought, but it's a powerful note on the personal experiments we run just because the opportunity is there. The Stanford Prison Experiment is an ideal taut psychological thriller that bristles with youthful energy and will mostly likely remain standing as one of the best of the year.\n\n8/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41130,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2015-07-17","keywords":"prisoner,guard,prison,psychology,university","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi739618841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU4MDQwNDc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMzg5NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjU4MDQwNDc5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxMzg5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It is the summer of 1971. Dr. Philip Zimbardo launches a study on the psychology of imprisonment. Twenty-four male undergraduates are randomly assigned to be either a guard or a prisoner. Set in a simulated jail, the project unfolds. The participants rapidly embody their roles -- the guards become power-hungry and sadistic, while the prisoners, subject to degradation, strategize as underdogs. It soon becomes clear that, as Zimbardo and team monitor the escalation of action through surveillance cameras, they are not fully aware of how they, too, have become part of the experiment.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3009232/","name":"Ezra Miller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4446467/","name":"Tye Sheridan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001082/","name":"Billy Crudup"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1547859/","name":"Kyle Patrick Alvarez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0270596/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0171098/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0025591/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0848003/","name":"Tim Talbott","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1674354/","name":"Philip Zimbardo"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Mission accomplished!!!","reviewBody":"For the avid Harry Potter reader the whole suspense leading up to HP Order of the Phoenix can be summed up in the word "how". How are they going to translate a nearly 900 page book to the screen, how are they going to tie together a storyline that in the 5th book breaks into dozens of streams like a mighty river coming to its delta.\n\nThis seemingly impossible task is well accomplished by astute summation of plot and concentration of action. Also, the heart and soul of the book, i.e. the thematic spirit of the story and Rowling's shining gift for characterization are given the fullest support in this film more so than in any previous HP movie.\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix basically involves Harry being persecuted by the government for telling a truth they refuse to believe all while dealing with the same feelings of teen angst and emerging love that any ordinary teen finds stressful and consuming. Only through the love and dedication of family and especially friends does Harry come across the means to fight back against the government, elude his enemies and make some sense of his emotional turmoil.\n\nMost reader's will come out of the theater saying "I wish they had shown this or that." However, all will leave satisfied that they have been treated to a faithful rendering brilliantly acted and directed. All the HP movies are a "good watch" but in this one we get a great movie.\n\nWe have the advantage of going to our HP movies with a non-reader and she was, to say the least, blown away and pronounced it a near classic. My daughter and myself have read and reread the books many times over and came out limp from exhilaration, our keen anticipation very much fulfilled.\n\nA few highlights: The acting is best ever.

And he's right on both fronts. The film is exquisitely crafted. The cinematography and set design is likely going to take home a couple gold guys. It's a film lover's dream movie. As with many of Scorsese's films, it's an inspired film history lesson along side of being a dreamlike children's fable. A really unique combination that will work for the film enthusiasts and discerning family's with kids. Maybe a bit long for broad audiences with very little kids, but the images are so enchanting, it should win over most everybody. Sasha Baron Cohen is a brilliant and hilarious standout as the twitchy constable. It should be very well received just on the 3D alone."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":314916,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-11-23","keywords":"cinema,automaton,clock,mechanical man,memory","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2781978137","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMzYwMzkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4OTU5Ng@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMzYwMzkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4OTU5Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in 1930s Paris, an orphan who lives in the walls of a train station is wrapped up in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton.

The best 3D to date","reviewBody":"Saw it today in a sneak preview today at the Director's Guild in LA. James Cameron who was there professed it's a masterpiece and the best 3D to date. And he's right on both fronts. The film is exquisitely crafted. The cinematography and set design is likely going to take home a couple gold guys. It's a film lover's dream movie. As with many of Scorsese's films, it's an inspired film history lesson along side of being a dreamlike children's fable. A really unique combination that will work for the film enthusiasts and discerning family's with kids. Maybe a bit long for broad audiences with very little kids, but the images are so enchanting, it should win over most everybody. Sasha Baron Cohen is a brilliant and hilarious standout as the twitchy constable. It should be very well received just on the 3D alone.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":314916,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Family"],"datePublished":"2011-11-23","keywords":"cinema,automaton,clock,mechanical man,memory","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2781978137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMzYwMzkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4OTU5Ng@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMzYwMzkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDM4OTU5Ng@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in 1930s Paris, an orphan who lives in the walls of a train station is wrapped up in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton.

It has to do with our own nightmares. Josh Brolin was a perfect piece of casting because in a way he doesn't have many personal colors. He's one of the bunch, one of us and we could put ourselves in his shoes. That is the art of film narrative expressed in a way that we've never experienced before. I heard people old enough to have seen Hitchcock's "Psycho" in the theaters and what glued them to the screen was their own fear. Well, that's what I've experienced here. Javier Bardem is superb, considering that he's the reason for the fear. He carries a human/inhuman kind of strength and we know he'll get us, sooner or later and if we consider the ending of the film, he might still do. Worthy Oscar winners, all of it and all of them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":910168,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-04-02","keywords":"sheriff,texas,contemporary western,cold blooded murder,desert","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi145883417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"No Country for Old Men Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000849/","name":"Javier Bardem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000982/","name":"Josh Brolin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565092/","name":"Cormac McCarthy"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As the pair drive 2,000 head of cattle ","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0455824/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Imdbidia"},"dateCreated":"2011-02-22","inLanguage":"English","name":"Old-style epic romantic movie","reviewBody":"An entertaining romantic drama by Buz Luhrmann, old-Hollywood style.\n\nThe movie is set in the Northern Territory of Australia in the years previous to the involvement of Japan in the WW II, and tells the story of Sarah Ashley -an English lady who goes to Australia to try to get her husband back to England and ends becoming the head of their Australian cattle farm-, Drover -an independent free-spirited cattle and horse drover that works for her- and Nullah -a half-caste Aboriginal child who lives in the farm and struggles to live in a world in which he's alien to both blacks and whites.\n\nThis is one of those movies that you can say it is done as the movies of the golden era of Hollywood used to be - flashy wonderfully well-looking movie stars, great scenery and great studio settings, detailed recreation of the era's fashion, decoration, atmosphere, etc., , and a simple epic plot with a great love story. Australia has all of this, but also a little bit of corn, a thin plot, weak characters and flaws that are even more noticeable in a super-production like this.\n\nThe script is uneven and Manichean (with angels and demons) and mixes several movie genres (romantic comedy, romantic drama, war movie, western movie, and Aboriginal movie) with different degrees of success. The characters are descriptive and without emotional depth, and that affects the acting. However, I loved the depiction of the magic and wisdom of Aboriginal Australians, which is really well presented, with its magic beliefs and philosophical and environmental approach to the world. I think that part is truly genuine and real and reaches the viewer. I also loved that Lady Ashley's character is the one of a true modern woman, as she is a strong-willed free woman, a boss, the boss of her man, a woman who always leads, never submissive or afraid of being alone if she doesn't get what she wants. That's a post-modern woman, so rare to see in cinema nowadays.\n\nThe acting is unconvincing on the part of the leading actors. Hugh Jackman's performance is just OK in his role, while Nicole Kidman disappoints in the comic part of the movie, as she seems not to relax when she does so, but she warms up to her usual self when the story becomes more dramatic; she looks beautiful in this movie, like a 50s movie star, although those inflated siliconed lips were a distraction... Jackman and Kidman make a great couple, but their chemistry on camera was nothing memorable and you see yourself seeing two actors playing a couple, not a real couple on screen.\n\nMost supporting actors are good in their roles, especially the Aboriginal ones, who really shine in this film. David Gulpilil is simply terrific, completely believable and inspired in his role of the Aboriginal Elder King George. Brandon Walters, despite his youth, offers a memorable performance, and his face really lights up the screen. Also great is the actor who plays Drove's Aboriginal pal, who also offers a solid performance. They are the ones who really give soul to the movie.\n\nDespite what you might expect, the cinematography is poor. I was expecting the rare beauty of the Northern Territory to be captured by the always stylish and colorful Luhrmann. However, the part of the movie that happens during the dry season is completely opaque and colorless, ugly to watch, while the scenes happening during the rainy season are again limited in colors.To my disenchantment, many of the most colorful and beautiful scenes are digitally created or enhanced, while others seem to have been shot in big studios. Just the Mission island seems to convey that luxurious real feeling of the NT vegetation. Some of the most beautiful bits of the real land, the aerial vistas, look like if they had been taken for a documentary for National Geographic. Where is the emotional connection of the story with the land? In other words, the viewer doesn't go beyond what the eyes see. So, one wonders, why the movie was called Australia and why it was sold as a movie that captured the spirit of this country. To be honest, I thought that most scenes in the movie could have been shot anywhere in the world not in Australia.\n\nThe movie is a little too long. Most of the first half an hour could have been removed , condensed or presented in another way to give the non-Aboriginal characters more emotional background and depth. For example, we barely know why Neil Fletcher wants so badly Sarah's farm, and why he's so wicked in general but he loves a lovable sweet good- hearted woman. He is just an archetypal bad-guy, period.\n\nDespite its flaws, I enjoyed the movie, especially the second hour and a half, and that heaven of a man that is Hugh Jackman. God Bless him and his holy body.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":122133,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2008-12-24","keywords":"prejudice,year 1942,year 1939,male objectification,australian aborigine","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Australia: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1784152089","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI5NzMwOTUwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTQ4MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set in northern Australia before World War II, an English aristocrat who inherits a sprawling ranch reluctantly pacts with a stock-man in order to protect her new property from a takeover plot"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000173/","name":"Nicole Kidman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0011354/","name":"Shea Adams"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0062619/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068628/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0064181/","name":"Stuart Beattie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0525303/","name":"Baz Luhrmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"}],"duration":"PT2H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

At the time the show really captured a certain nineties sensibility - it was cynical, tongue-in-cheek, adult. Though not your average SATC fan - heterosexual, thirty-something male working in IT - I became obsessed, and was sure to see each new episode the first time it aired. However, over time I became disillusioned with the series.\n\nFirst, I eventually read the book. Despite the author's reluctance to say anything, the show never was much like the book, and has - over the years - strayed far far away.

We may no longer be hunting our food, or struggling to keep the fire going, but it is still all about survival. Bushnell is great at depicting the primal hunger that, while it once made man fight to the death over territory or a fresh kill, now makes women deck themselves out in top gear and hunt down that Banker or Fortune 500 Executive, or fight tooth-and-nail to break through the glass ceiling.\n\nSecond, somewhere midlife, SATC, the show, got lost. All that incidental stuff - the shoes and bags, and places-to-be-seen - moved from the background to the foreground. The show became one long glossy luxury goods advertisement, the kind found in Vanity Fair. The movie underlines this - while there are great story lines, etc, the theatrical release is one obscene orgy of consumerism and decadence.\n\nToo bad. The last years of SATC is an insult to both the book and the early years of the show. It is certainly an insult to the public, but - considering SATC was most popular in its later years - maybe the insult is much deserved.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114914,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-06-06","keywords":"friendship between women,friendship,love life,casual sex,new york city","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000572/","name":"Sarah Jessica Parker"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000326/","name":"Kim Cattrall"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004862/","name":"Kristin Davis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020963/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050436/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0823015/","name":"Darren Star"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Sex and the City: The Sixth Season - Part 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi394723609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI0MjIzN2YtMTlhYS00ZjM0LThkZTAtZTU4ZDdlODEzZjViXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from HBO Home Video"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It goes back and forth between completely ridiculous to somewhat interesting. Unfortunately it is also a pale imitation to the novel its based on, only using the bare skeleton of the story, and not delving into what truly made the novel profound. Michael B. Jordan's character was so completely ridiculous and different than the novel version in the first 15 minutes that I nearly stopped watching it, but thankfully that subsides. There were many things from the book I expected to see, only to piss me off when they were either not there at all, or altered in some way for no justifiable reason. So while many of the basic plot points are there, tough some of them changed, it just didn't possess what the book did.\n\nI did like Michael Shannon's character and his acting, and while Jordan's character is completely off-putting, it does get tolerable as the film goes on. There were a couple of meaningful discussions, but the essential meaning of the book burning is completely missed, it was to create a people void of free thought, and while that is hinted at, for the most part its nowhere near as deep and introspective as the novel, its a very basic rendering of and incredibly deep story. I for the most part was disappointed, it could have been so much better, all the had to do was pay attention to the source material, and not just scan over it. Also the re-writing of many of the characters is inconceivable to me, no idea why they would do it. \n\nMeh... I didn't like it very much.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19169,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-20","keywords":"dystopia,book burning,flamethrower,emoji,based on novel","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1047967769","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a terrifying care-free future, a young man, Guy Montag, whose job as a fireman is to burn all books, questions his actions after meeting a young girl...and begins to rebel against society."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0430107/","name":"Michael B.

It goes back and forth between completely ridiculous to somewhat interesting. Unfortunately it is also a pale imitation to the novel its based on, only using the bare skeleton of the story, and not delving into what truly made the novel profound. Michael B. Jordan's character was so completely ridiculous and different than the novel version in the first 15 minutes that I nearly stopped watching it, but thankfully that subsides. There were many things from the book I expected to see, only to piss me off when they were either not there at all, or altered in some way for no justifiable reason. So while many of the basic plot points are there, tough some of them changed, it just didn't possess what the book did.\n\nI did like Michael Shannon's character and his acting, and while Jordan's character is completely off-putting, it does get tolerable as the film goes on. There were a couple of meaningful discussions, but the essential meaning of the book burning is completely missed, it was to create a people void of free thought, and while that is hinted at, for the most part its nowhere near as deep and introspective as the novel, its a very basic rendering of and incredibly deep story. I for the most part was disappointed, it could have been so much better, all the had to do was pay attention to the source material, and not just scan over it. Also the re-writing of many of the characters is inconceivable to me, no idea why they would do it. \n\nMeh... I didn't like it very much.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":19169,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-20","keywords":"dystopia,book burning,flamethrower,emoji,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1047967769","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjEwZjI5YzAtMzlmNC00YzVkLTgzOTgtNGM0ZmIyZDU3M2ZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In a terrifying care-free future, a young man, Guy Montag, whose job as a fireman is to burn all books, questions his actions after meeting a young girl...and begins to rebel against society.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0430107/","name":"Michael B.

When The Boss croons to signal the finale, you're gonna be all in!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4197,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-11-06","keywords":"boxing,runaway,cross country trip,travel,amateur fighter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3036201241","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjE2NWNkOGUtNWFlZC00NjA0LWIxNTktZjZjNDI4ZWNjMjY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjE2NWNkOGUtNWFlZC00NjA0LWIxNTktZjZjNDI4ZWNjMjY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A reluctant bare-knuckle boxer and his manager/brother must travel across the country for one last fight, but an unexpected travel companion exposes the cracks in their bond along the way.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0402271/","name":"Charlie Hunnam","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1925239/","name":"Jack O'Connell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3608877/","name":"Naheem Garcia"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935253/","name":"Max Winkler"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0539689/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0259281/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4237558/","name":"Theodore Bressman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2434358/","name":"David Branson Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935253/","name":"Max Winkler"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly.

This ill conceived, miscast, puerile piece of garbage has very little to do with the late Mr. Porter's actual life and even less to do with his music. The movie even admits on a certain level that it's a fake by using footage from another horribly miscast biopic about Cole Porter, starring Cary Grant and Alexis Smith! \n\nAnother review I've read mentions that: "At the first night parties there seemed a disproportionately high number of black people as guests, and also in other scenes." Historical documentation supports that Cole Porter's life, especially while in New York, was more integrated than a casual observer might think. On the contrary, there were many black people who attended the late Mr. Porter's, shall we say..."Night Parties". Primarily Black male prostitutes whom he patronized at the Harlem brothels he frequented. A few, even served as inspiration for some of his more popular songs. This subject, which is a key part of Cole Porter's life, is conveniently leeched out of the story.\n\nThis isn't the only bone of contention I have with this movie. Much of the movie's music is taken out of context, not only chronologically, but also stylistically and logistically. He wrote songs for key reasons at key times. For instance, the very woman who was supposed to have inspired this movie, Cole Porter's wife Linda, also was reported to have given the song "De-lovely", its name. This is referenced in many notable biographies of Cole Porter.\n\nIf you actually want to know about his real life and his REAL music, go to the library and read for yourself about the actual person. Then, start by listening to his music. Ella Fitzgerald's Cole porter songbook serves as an excellent introduction. And if you're still intrigued, there are actual recordings of the late Mr. Porter playing and singing his own music. If you're reading this, you've obviously got online access, so do yourself a huge favor, start by visiting some of the online multi-media, book and music outlets and enter his name in a search. For the time investment of a few simple key-strokes and mouse clicks, you'll be able to learn and truly appreciate more about Cole Porter, his life, his music and his genius, than this blanched, consumptive Kevin Kline vehicle could ever hope to provide."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11229,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2004-08-06","keywords":"jukebox musical,horseback riding,cole porter character,monty woolley character,louis b. mayer character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4233871641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RmYmVjNjctM2Y4Ni00NmM1LTg2ZGYtOTg3OTQ2MzQ2Njc4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000177/","name":"Kevin Kline"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000171/","name":"Ashley Judd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005563/","name":"Irwin Winkler"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0098170/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049390/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0168379/","name":"Jay Cocks"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To add would only dilute it. Yes, your left pleading for more but that's not because it's left unsatisfactory. No, it's because during the entire film, you're absolutely riveted and captivated! People, this is Barry Levinsons film, headed by De Niro and Michelle Pheifer! Levinson is a genius at his craft as are the formers. This film is bleak and at times depressing but I promise you never for a second not so engaged in it! De Niro becomes Madoff physically even the way he walks. The cast is incredible. Finally De Niro immersed himself into a character that can portray his craft. This is one vehicle, the cast-directing-editing, that sums up to make a masterpiece!

To add would only dilute it. Yes, your left pleading for more but that's not because it's left unsatisfactory. No, it's because during the entire film, you're absolutely riveted and captivated! People, this is Barry Levinsons film, headed by De Niro and Michelle Pheifer! Levinson is a genius at his craft as are the formers. This film is bleak and at times depressing but I promise you never for a second not so engaged in it! De Niro becomes Madoff physically even the way he walks. The cast is incredible. Finally De Niro immersed himself into a character that can portray his craft. This is one vehicle, the cast-directing-editing, that sums up to make a masterpiece! This is by far the most captivating, engaging, riveting movie I've seen this year by far! Do yourself a favor and watch this immediately!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":24225,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Biography","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2017-05-20","keywords":"financial fraud,financier,ponzi scheme,fraudster,fraud","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tonight 8/7c","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi42121497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3MDQxNTU0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODkxODczMjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Bernie Madoff and his Ponzi scheme.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005273/","name":"Alessandro Nivola"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001469/","name":"Barry Levinson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0063961/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506094/","name":"Sam Levinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2331718/","name":"John Burnham Schwartz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1345603/","name":"Samuel Baum"],"duration":"PT2H13M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The L Word is back and it's not bad at all!","reviewBody":"The L Word changed my life. I was a very confused 14 year Colombian girl living in a very small city with my very Catholic family. I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show.

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent.

Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know.

I love the deadpan delivery of funny lines: "I just bit into a pepper," a man says, when caught tearing up. I love the payoff when scams reach their climax.\n\nBut I wanted this movie to thrill me as the previous "Ocean" movies have, and, while it was a slick good time, it wasn't memorable.\n\nThere is less character development here than in previous movies. Ocean is not pursuing Tess. Linus has pretty much proved himself.\n\nThere wasn't the spectacular stunts as performed by Shaobo Qin in "Ocean's 11" or Vincent Cassel in "Ocean's 12." "Ocean's 13" doesn't fully exploit Las Vegas -- we've seen this movie's Las Vegas before.\n\nAl Pacino is kind of blah as the villain. I wasn't afraid of him; I just kept wondering why he had orange hair. Andy Garcia is more juicy in a smaller, ambivalent role.\n\nThe movie resuscitates the film career of Ellen Barkin. She looks spectacular: flat stomach, legs to die for, magnificent cleavage. And then what do they do? Humiliate her and make a bitter comment about how she is a woman "of a certain age." "Oceans 13" would have been a better movie if it had made better use of this hot actress. A sex scene between her and the ever cool Matt Damon would have perked the movie up.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":334174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-06-06","keywords":"revenge,casino,heist,comeuppance,hubris","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Thirteen","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1654522137","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyMjAyZDItNDc3Mi00N2JiLTlmNzctNmRhYjI1ZDJkYjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyMjAyZDItNDc3Mi00N2JiLTlmNzctNmRhYjI1ZDJkYjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024560/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002718/","name":"Brian Koppelman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505522/","name":"David Levien"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I love the deadpan delivery of funny lines: "I just bit into a pepper," a man says, when caught tearing up. I love the payoff when scams reach their climax.\n\nBut I wanted this movie to thrill me as the previous "Ocean" movies have, and, while it was a slick good time, it wasn't memorable.\n\nThere is less character development here than in previous movies. Ocean is not pursuing Tess. Linus has pretty much proved himself.\n\nThere wasn't the spectacular stunts as performed by Shaobo Qin in "Ocean's 11" or Vincent Cassel in "Ocean's 12." "Ocean's 13" doesn't fully exploit Las Vegas -- we've seen this movie's Las Vegas before.\n\nAl Pacino is kind of blah as the villain. I wasn't afraid of him; I just kept wondering why he had orange hair. Andy Garcia is more juicy in a smaller, ambivalent role.\n\nThe movie resuscitates the film career of Ellen Barkin. She looks spectacular: flat stomach, legs to die for, magnificent cleavage. And then what do they do? Humiliate her and make a bitter comment about how she is a woman "of a certain age." "Oceans 13" would have been a better movie if it had made better use of this hot actress. A sex scene between her and the ever cool Matt Damon would have perked the movie up.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":334174,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2007-06-06","keywords":"revenge,casino,heist,comeuppance,hubris","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Thirteen","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1654522137","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyMjAyZDItNDc3Mi00N2JiLTlmNzctNmRhYjI1ZDJkYjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTUyMjAyZDItNDc3Mi00N2JiLTlmNzctNmRhYjI1ZDJkYjA1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000354/","name":"Matt Damon"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024560/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002718/","name":"Brian Koppelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505522/","name":"David Levien","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But it doesn't possess a very original plot line, which doesn't even portray enough references to be called Final Fantasy, and should have just been another Sci-fi called "The Spirits Within".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":81317,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2001-10-31","keywords":"based on video game,motion capture,profanity,weapons fire,movie flop","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi715587865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q4NmRlYmItYTA1Yy00MjI0LTliODktY2UzMWU4OTg4MDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2Q4NmRlYmItYTA1Yy00MjI0LTliODktY2UzMWU4OTg4MDc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Columbia Tristar","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000114/","name":"Steve Buscemi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001840/","name":"Ming-Na Wen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0756983/","name":"Hironobu Sakaguchi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012102/","name":"Motonori Sakakibara"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012408/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035851/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0040831/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0756983/","name":"Hironobu Sakaguchi","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718031/","name":"Al Reinert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0899113/","name":"Jeff Vintar"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over.

Seldom have I seen such a fun programme. Yes, fun. This was funny, sexy, violent, bonkers and emotionally truthful in a way that other series fail to achieve.\n\nTo think that this was aiming for any kind of historical accuracy is mad. It was made as an entertainment riffing on possible historical events. The use of modern language, initially jarring, ends up working to its advantage. There's no more reason to dislike modern usage than there is to dislike cod medieval or cod turn of the millennia language. Any language choice is going to be inauthentic so you might as well go for modern vernacular which has the side effect of milking the dialogue for humour. Using Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man for the theme tune is as inspired as using Nick Cave for the theme tune of Peaky Blinders. \n\nYou might also like to note the satirical reference to other well-known franchises and the use of Shakespearian minor characters. The two centurions sampling the "stash" of the witch doctor was comedy gold.\n\nYes, how we all hunger for the certainty of the old days when you knew where you were.

Its core audience is the 5- 12 crowd, and let's face facts: kids will laugh at anything! That's exactly why I've never been a big fan of family films. I'm always bound to experience the predictable quotient of gags that involve vomit, farts and kicks in the groin - all of which are in this movie. Helen Keller can see the punchlines coming a mile away. Ice Cube seems thoroughly embarrassed to be a part of this movie. I'm sure he took on the project to hopefully broaden his demographic (never having done a PG film before). The kids, like most actors their age, constantly overact. Their nonstop bickering makes you feel Ice Cube's pain of having to escort them. Cube ends up getting into every implausible disaster you can possibly imagine. It would help if the gags had even a shred of credibility. Not to mention, every time something embarrassing and disastrous happens to Cube's character, the kids laugh like hyenas, making the gags mean-spirited as well as unfunny. The only moment I remember laughing is when the kids try to drive off in Cube's minivan. He chases after them and tries to climb inside through the sunroof. The kids crash into a giant statue of a lumberjack, holding an axe. The axe then falls down and nails Cube right in his groin. Another predictable gag, but after long periods of not laughing, I had to relieve myself in some fashion. And like in all these movies, there's a schmaltzy conclusion that's supposed to deliver a "message." When I left the theater, I saw this one mother who was so fed up with her bratty son that she picked him up and spanked him, yelling out obscenities. Obviously, this message of accepting kids for who they are, no matter how bratty they get, didn't sink through her head. So why do these films even bother? When you have a movie as detached from reality as "Are We There Yet?" it's hard to deliver a message to its audience that will linger with them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31076,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2005-05-25","keywords":"braces,fish out of water,child gagged,reference to lebron james,reference to 50 cent","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Are We There Yet?","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1991704857","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001084/","name":"Ice Cube"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000505/","name":"Nia Long"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0020248/","name":"Aleisha Allen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505152/","name":"Brian Levant"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044714/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1027958/","name":"Steven Gary Banks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1257282/","name":"Claudia Grazioso"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826425/","name":"J.

And the fact that these are men being shown off as models and not women.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":255390,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2002-02-27","keywords":"male model,fashion model,conspiracy,fashion,malaysia","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0852132/","name":"Christine Taylor"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045189/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0766153/","name":"Drake Sather","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357453/","name":"John Hamburg"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But we need guys like him, conservative and mechanical in their efficiency, who will hold down the paradigm as others more adventurous fight to shift it, who will remind us by the arbitrary limits they impose that there must be a broader space. It's always the routine and familiar that kindles dreaming.\n\nAnd this is just so routine. Abrams takes the Spielberg-Lucas model of climax after climax, starting with an Indiana Jones prologue. A few simple moral dilemmas form the backbone, inherited with a wink from the Trek genealogy. The hamfisted 9/11 allegory, enforced by terrorist bombings and a final 'plane crash' in Starfleet hq, is that we may covet revenge but we are dehumanized in the process. Khan as a vengeful mujahedeen, 'trained' by the secret military which is headed by a cowboy admiral hellbent on preemptive war. (Interestingly, everything about Khan's handling here bears Nolan's influence.)\n\nSoulless. \n\nSo it is fitting that this guy is spearheading the next generation of established cinematic imagination, taking over from Lucas who is now retired, and Spielberg who is 'respectable'.

But we need guys like him, conservative and mechanical in their efficiency, who will hold down the paradigm as others more adventurous fight to shift it, who will remind us by the arbitrary limits they impose that there must be a broader space. It's always the routine and familiar that kindles dreaming.\n\nAnd this is just so routine. Abrams takes the Spielberg-Lucas model of climax after climax, starting with an Indiana Jones prologue. A few simple moral dilemmas form the backbone, inherited with a wink from the Trek genealogy. The hamfisted 9/11 allegory, enforced by terrorist bombings and a final 'plane crash' in Starfleet hq, is that we may covet revenge but we are dehumanized in the process. Khan as a vengeful mujahedeen, 'trained' by the secret military which is headed by a cowboy admiral hellbent on preemptive war. (Interestingly, everything about Khan's handling here bears Nolan's influence.)\n\nSoulless. \n\nSo it is fitting that this guy is spearheading the next generation of established cinematic imagination, taking over from Lucas who is now retired, and Spielberg who is 'respectable'. I'm sure that in 20 years time he will be making his own respectable war movies. That kids growing up on stuff like this will fondly elevate the memory. And that his idea of artistry, Welles' action camera dotted by twinkles of color, lasers and flares, will be elaborated on in essays about his aesthetics, maybe.\n\nAll of which is just a natural state of things, nothing to get up in arms about.

A year later I had almost forgot about it until I started seeing commercials on TV and I got my hopes high. To be honest, this is probably the first movie that met my expectations.\n\nI didn't go in expecting the greatest movie ever, I mean it does have Marky Mark in it and I'd hate to think he's be the start of my favorite movie of all time. But I did expect it to be exciting, emotional, and engaging... And it was.\n\nOne of the things this movie does best is show the love and commitment between the brothers. The chemistry between the actors was excellent and really added to the feel of the film. It takes a lot to get emotion out of me in a movie, I'm talking the beginning of Saving Private Ryan a lot, so I unfortunately didn't feel as much as some of the other people in the theater, but you know something is right when people cheer when the main characters kill bad guys and yell "NO!" when things don't go right. The emotions between the brothers also led to many very funny comic moments, which I did not expect to see as many as I did. I laughed many times.\n\nSingleton is probably a better write than director, but he does a decent job through out. Most of the film is simple camera angles and what not, but there were a few moments, specifically a car chase, that was shot really well. It was all done in a manor that kept it realistic while keeping it interesting. It should also be noted that this movie had the SECOND most intense shoot out I've ever seen in a movie. Second only to, of course, the LA streets shoot out in Heat which, in my opinion, is the most intense 15 minutes ever filmed.\n\nActing was decent. Like mentioned before, the chemistry between the brothers was great, but there were many simple one-liners and Mark Wahlberg seems to play the same character way too often. Not really acting so much as reading lines in a tough way.\n\nWhile this isn't the #1 movie of the year it definitely met my expectations and is a very, very good summer action flick of not more.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":141064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-11-16","keywords":"corrupt police,death of brother,death of mother,murder,funeral","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Four Brothers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1135083801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZhYjI4MzAtNjJiMi00ODQ4LTkwOGEtNThhNmRlNDI3MzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZhYjI4MzAtNjJiMi00ODQ4LTkwOGEtNThhNmRlNDI3MzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0879085/","name":"Tyrese Gibson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0071275/","name":"André 3000"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005436/","name":"John Singleton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117723/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332238/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254213/","name":"David Elliot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1749087/","name":"Paul Lovett"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While he's driving along with his wife(Lucinda Jenney), he accidentally hits a gypsy with his car and run. Then he's cursed by an old gypsy(Michael Constantine) and his gorgeous daughter(Kari Wuher) with a continuous weight loss.

Furthermore, Billy is friend of a local mobster named Richie(Joe Mantegna) who is determined to save him, originating a cruel vendetta.\n\nThinner was written by Stephen King in 1984, based on horror master bestselling novel of the same name, under pseudonym Richard Bachman . Early the 90s, Warner Brothers attempted cinema rendition with John Candy, but death actor made the pre-production failed. The Paramount Pictures took the production with interesting script by Tom Holland(Langoliers) and Michael Mc Dowell( screenwriter of Beetlejuice and Tales from the darkside). Casting is frankly decent, Robert James Burke(usual of director Hal Hartley), recently his success in Robocop 3, Joe Mantegna(usual of David Mamet,Things change,House of games,Homicide),the beautiful Kari Wuher(Anaconda,Sliders). Besides, as always, habitual cameo by Stephen King as Dr. Bangor. The film displays adequate musical score fitting to terror and suspense by Daniel Licht The motion picture is professionally directed by Tom Holland(Fright night,Child's play), a director expert in horror and suspense movies. The result is better than previous Stephen king adaptation, the mediocre, Running man.

While he's driving along with his wife(Lucinda Jenney), he accidentally hits a gypsy with his car and run. Then he's cursed by an old gypsy(Michael Constantine) and his gorgeous daughter(Kari Wuher) with a continuous weight loss. With the complicity of local judge and the sheriff (Daniel Von Bargen)Billy is absolved. Furthermore, Billy is friend of a local mobster named Richie(Joe Mantegna) who is determined to save him, originating a cruel vendetta.\n\nThinner was written by Stephen King in 1984, based on horror master bestselling novel of the same name, under pseudonym Richard Bachman . Early the 90s, Warner Brothers attempted cinema rendition with John Candy, but death actor made the pre-production failed. The Paramount Pictures took the production with interesting script by Tom Holland(Langoliers) and Michael Mc Dowell( screenwriter of Beetlejuice and Tales from the darkside). Casting is frankly decent, Robert James Burke(usual of director Hal Hartley), recently his success in Robocop 3, Joe Mantegna(usual of David Mamet,Things change,House of games,Homicide),the beautiful Kari Wuher(Anaconda,Sliders). Besides, as always, habitual cameo by Stephen King as Dr. Bangor. The film displays adequate musical score fitting to terror and suspense by Daniel Licht The motion picture is professionally directed by Tom Holland(Fright night,Child's play), a director expert in horror and suspense movies. The result is better than previous Stephen king adaptation, the mediocre, Running man. Rating : Acceptable and passable picture, well worth watching for Stephen King fond.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":29777,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Fantasy","Horror"],"datePublished":"1996-10-25","keywords":"gypsy,female stockinged legs,pantyhose,psychological thriller,overweight","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stephen King's Thinner","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1131459609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzc2NmFmMTMtYmVhMi00MmM1LWI5MWMtMTllNzMyOWI4ZDUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzc2NmFmMTMtYmVhMi00MmM1LWI5MWMtMTllNzMyOWI4ZDUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0121559/","name":"Robert John Burke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001505/","name":"Joe Mantegna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0421087/","name":"Lucinda Jenney"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276169/","name":"Tom Holland"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0025957/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568313/","name":"Michael McDowell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0276169/","name":"Tom Holland"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Devotees of classic cops and robbers flicks of old will no doubt take exception, but I believe that Michael Mann achieved some measure of perfection with Heat. To break this three-hour gem of a film down to its core, this is a film about men - strong men - and the supporting role that he women of the film have on them for better or worse. Take Pacino as good cop Vincent Hanna: one of the most intense characterizations of the tragic hero that I have ever witnessed, as he laments the demise of his third marriage to a pill-junkie wife. A fact which he discusses with his archnemesis (De Niro) in what history will regard as one of the most frenetic scenes in the history of film. The dialogue in this scene (at the very end of the first tape, if you own the VHS version) sets up the last half of the film beautifully, as our two rivals come to the joint realization that they have no hand in choosing the paths that will lead them to their ultimate confrontation: their very natures so define their respective actions that any attempt to do otherwise would simply be a waste of time. While I have heard others (who I am ashamed at times to call close friends) say that Heat drags in places, I will concede that there are moments in the film that require more than the cursory attention that they give to the movie they happen to be watching at any given time (I'm sorry not every director is Jerry Bruckheimer), there are poignant developments of character in Heat that many would casually disregard. I am thinking of the interaction between the ex-con who finds conditional employment in a diner with an opportunistic scum of a boss, and whose girlfriend is so proud of him for swallowing his pride and not simply giving the sonofabitch a good pummeling. But there is a catharsis that I felt for that same ex-con when De Niro's character presents him with the opportunity to take just one more score, for old time's sake. Who doesn't feel for this guy - this minor character in a film with big-time heavyweights who gets to shine for a few brief moments. That's what Heat is really: a series of brief moments, some touching, others traumatic, and still others incredibly horrifying in the feelings that they inspire in the romantic who, like me sees not black or white portrayals of protagonist and villain, but a montage of grays that combine to create a vivid spectrum of film characterization that could not be found in hundreds of films combined. One of my five favorite films of all time, Heat is a cinematic banquet of intense imagery and pulse-pounding action. Come hungry.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":616031,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1995-12-15","keywords":"gun battle,armored car robbery,gunfight,organized crime,honor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Heat: Director's Definitive Edition","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi664516889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdjMDhhNWMtNWQ3ZS00YTY1LTgzYjQtYmU1YjAzYmI2NGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTdjMDhhNWMtNWQ3ZS00YTY1LTgzYjQtYmU1YjAzYmI2NGFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Clip: Splits"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000199/","name":"Al Pacino"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000174/","name":"Val Kilmer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035930/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000520/","name":"Michael Mann"}],"duration":"PT2H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Elvis starts out working on a boat but gets fired and works for the Hilton. Interesting story, that he used to be in a circus, but due to a tragedy no longer is with the circus. I like the way he has two love interests in this movie, one being Ursula Andress. It's cool the way he gets his confidence back.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3178,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Music"],"datePublished":"1963-11-27","keywords":"psychotronic film,yacht,mariachi band,male singer,chef's table","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000062/","name":"Elvis Presley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000266/","name":"Ursula Andress","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0194597/","name":"Elsa Cárdenas"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0861703/","name":"Richard Thorpe"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197491/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0918902/","name":"Allan Weiss"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After busting a murderer, she's promoted to inspector by the commissioner (Samuel L. Jackson), who also happens to be her legal guardian thanks to a rather sordid past. Tess' new partner is Del Marco (Andy Garcia), and they're quickly assigned to their first case when a corpse is discovered by the shore.

Examples? Judd keeps hearing a metallic clinking outside her apartment every night before the murders, and she keeps drinking alcohol on those same nights and consequently blacks out. This is a repeated process, so you'd think it take her more than the majority of the film's running time to figure out her drink might be tainted with a drug or that whoever's making that noise might somehow be associated with her blackouts. \n\nFiguring out the identity of the killer is almost too easy.

What really tends to work well for this one is the fact that there's so much more fun cheesy action than expected here which provides this one with such a frantic pace that there's so much good times to come from this one. The first attack where they erupt on the beach is a great cheesy highlight with the formations appearing in the Florida skyline and the panic of the fleeing beach-crowds getting swarmed makes for a good time, the city-wide panic where they keep encountering the creatures in the apartment complex, at the car-depot and then the big scene with the creatures at the school while trying to re-check their supplies which introduces several big chases through the labs and classrooms trying to avoid them as their continued presence makes for a series of really enjoyable pieces that have a big impact on the film's overall pacing. That also manages to work for the rather shorter attacks throughout here that shows the spiders coming into play against the citizenry in fine form getting in the usual Sci-Fi Channel style fun and highly enjoyable encounters which manage to provide the big boost this needs to go into the finale which has the same overall fun and enjoyment with the big plan to finally take down the largest spider in the bunch which is where this one really gets quite enjoyable delivering plenty of thrilling action throughout here trying to execute their wacky plan to stop it that manages to top the exceptionally goofy and silly one from the original. That as well plays a big part of how much fun this one is as it still features the same overall attitude and tone as the first which helps to make the creatures that much more of a threat and gives the few silly lines that much more of an impact with the tone being quite consistent all the way through both. That said, there's still the one main flaw here that does tend to crop up in every single one of these films in that there's just absolutely nothing at all that realistic about the way the CGI looks in here, which is so obvious and fake that it really becomes distracting with the low-rent production getting this to look so out-of-sync with a real-life creature who fail to match their backgrounds all that accurately while managing to get the same overall grading and scene placement flaws that become prevalent and somewhat expected in these kinds of films.

For much of the film you only see Khary Payton's character Michael Forest, doing his day to day routine astronaut activities. What could be a boring concept is not and you are entertained by his performance making you care deeply about his character Michael. You'll be asking yourself how would I handle being all alone in space. I am sure I would not be able to do it. I have even more respect for astronauts after watching this movie.

For much of the film you only see Khary Payton's character Michael Forest, doing his day to day routine astronaut activities. What could be a boring concept is not and you are entertained by his performance making you care deeply about his character Michael. You'll be asking yourself how would I handle being all alone in space. I am sure I would not be able to do it. I have even more respect for astronauts after watching this movie.

Prequels to films are often made when there is either a rich back story behind the originals or the producers are wanting a little more money from a particular franchise (see the Star Wars prequels). The problem they present is that film- makers have to construct their work, with the knowledge that the audience knows how it ends. One of the greatest things about seeing a film for the first time is the surprise and anticipation, to removing that can detract a lot from the overall impact of the film. But this summer I have had the pleasure of seeing X-men First Class, and now Rise of the Planet of the Apes - two excellent prequels to series that I didn't care for previously.\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes (RPA from now on, I can't bear typing it) is not only a triumph in CG animation, but as a stellar science fiction film, that remembers that films are infinitely more engaging when the audience actually cares for the characters on screen. Too often do I see films with a high premise that forget to flesh out their characters, leaving us to run around in mindless, weightless explosions with nobodies who we know less than 3 things about (cough, Transformers 3). Yes, RPA is about super intelligent apes that ransack cities and take on armed forces with little more than what surrounds them, but before we get to that there is an enormous amount of development from the main protagonist; Caesar. Although the advertisement trumpets James Franco, John Lithgow etc, the real star here is Andy Serkis, along with millions of dollars worth of CG animation to create the most expressive animated creatures on film. Even with Avatar, using real humans, pales in comparison to the amount of detail going into every single one of these apes; there is not one second in the film where you cannot understand one of the primates intentions - you could practically vocalise them yourself with the refined eye movement, body language that clearly separates Caesar from his more primitive relatives. Needless to say, Caesar's performance is flawless; after all this is the man who brought Gollum to life, but he captures the screen with an entirely wordless performance, which to me is the greatest part of the film. I felt for Caesar more than any other character in this film, and he did it without saying a word. Eat that Michael Bay. I was almost in tears at one point during one of Caesar's more emotional scenes for Christ Sake - although a chimp, the heightened intelligence really gives him just enough human characteristic to be above the uncanny valley while still behaving like an animal.\n\nThe humans in the film were what I considered weakest in this film; not any of the performances were bad, but a little more development in some minor characters and some tweak in the writing here and there would have made this a perfect 10. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy) felt a bit off to me; he was cruel but almost in a cartoon way, though I suspect that's more to do with ill writing than any personal issues. The main cast are good, though at it's current length, I think more development with James Franco's character wouldn't have gone amiss, but then again, this might have thrown off the pacing.\n\nAnother thing I love about this film is that while taking a sharp diversion from its roots in terms of gradual characterisation, it does a superb job of delivering what everyone inevitably came for. A massive Chimpocalypse. A simian uprising that sees the downtrodden apes taking up arms against humanity, and in three words: it's f - ing cool. Made all the more exciting by the anticipation and the feel for these characters, the marvellous point about Caesar's character is that we sympathise with him, we understand why he leads an ape army AND WE SUPPORT HIM. A super intelligent ape is rallying a chimp attack force to free themselves from their confines, cause mayhem, disrupt order and ultimately rule humanity AND WE WANT THEM TO. And for that I applaud.\n\nI love a film that makes us look inwards at ourselves and question our own moral codes and attitudes to events in life (this one clearly representing a case of animal cruelty) that make us conclude that WE are indeed the bad guys, and we need to change. Living in a small, rural middle-class society (like myself) or a well-developed area often makes mainstream audiences forget about those less fortunate than themselves, and what it drives them to, or in this case, what having too much drives us to, and it's refreshing to see something that reminds us of how much of a plague we are to the rest of the planet.\n\nOverall, I would say a strong 9/10, perhaps not quite reaching the highs that First Class did, but by God, was it more consistent - definitely watch this one, and stay after the credits.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":511037,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2011-08-05","keywords":"ape,chimpanzee,planet of the apes,alzheimer's disease,when animals attack","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1615502617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI0NDI4MjU5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTgwMDYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Rise of the Planet of the Apes: Trailer #2"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0290556/","name":"James Franco"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0785227/","name":"Andy Serkis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2951768/","name":"Freida Pinto"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1012501/","name":"Rupert Wyatt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174373/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0415425/","name":"Rick Jaffa"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0798646/","name":"Amanda Silver"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0099541/","name":"Pierre Boulle"}],"duration":"PT1H45M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

What really tends to work well for this one is the fact that there's so much more fun cheesy action than expected here which provides this one with such a frantic pace that there's so much good times to come from this one. The first attack where they erupt on the beach is a great cheesy highlight with the formations appearing in the Florida skyline and the panic of the fleeing beach-crowds getting swarmed makes for a good time, the city-wide panic where they keep encountering the creatures in the apartment complex, at the car-depot and then the big scene with the creatures at the school while trying to re-check their supplies which introduces several big chases through the labs and classrooms trying to avoid them as their continued presence makes for a series of really enjoyable pieces that have a big impact on the film's overall pacing.

That as well plays a big part of how much fun this one is as it still features the same overall attitude and tone as the first which helps to make the creatures that much more of a threat and gives the few silly lines that much more of an impact with the tone being quite consistent all the way through both. That said, there's still the one main flaw here that does tend to crop up in every single one of these films in that there's just absolutely nothing at all that realistic about the way the CGI looks in here, which is so obvious and fake that it really becomes distracting with the low-rent production getting this to look so out-of-sync with a real-life creature who fail to match their backgrounds all that accurately while managing to get the same overall grading and scene placement flaws that become prevalent and somewhat expected in these kinds of films.
