Her parents (Essie Davis and Ben Mendelsohn) are dysfunctional and unraveling and have drug problems of their own. They don't like her daughter's boyfriend and under normal circumstances probably wouldn't tolerate him. But he's the only thing that brings their daughter some respite from the hell she's going through, so they sort of adopt him as their own.\n\n"Babyteeth" is a coming of age movie that's set apart from others like it because of the protagonist's existential crisis. Scanlan's character is as immature in some ways as any sixteen year old, but at the same time is being asked to summon up reserves of maturity to deal with the ultimate curve ball life has to throw at us. How do you balance the emotional and hormonal ups and downs of teen romance with the possibility of your impending death?\n\nThe film is a bit monotonous in tone and starts to feel like a grind after a while. But again, it's worth seeing for the performances and for the unsentimental treatment of the subject matter that would have possibly segued into the maudlin in different hands. The ending scene is the most devastating thing I've seen in a movie this year.\n\nGrade: B+","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14022,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"MA-17","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2020-07-23","keywords":"pills,dog,teenage girl loses her hair,teenage girl wears a wig,hospital","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Babyteeth","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi678936601","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzM2ODA5ZDItMjJjMS00ZTYxLTk3ODItOTNiMGEwZGQ2NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzM2ODA5ZDItMjJjMS00ZTYxLTk3ODItOTNiMGEwZGQ2NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7340546/","name":"Eliza Scanlen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9334013/","name":"Michelle Lotters"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3108675/","name":"Toby Wallace"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2221724/","name":"Shannon Murphy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0658237/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017733/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1514808/","name":"Rita Kalnejais"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Her parents (Essie Davis and Ben Mendelsohn) are dysfunctional and unraveling and have drug problems of their own. They don't like her daughter's boyfriend and under normal circumstances probably wouldn't tolerate him. But he's the only thing that brings their daughter some respite from the hell she's going through, so they sort of adopt him as their own.\n\n"Babyteeth" is a coming of age movie that's set apart from others like it because of the protagonist's existential crisis. Scanlan's character is as immature in some ways as any sixteen year old, but at the same time is being asked to summon up reserves of maturity to deal with the ultimate curve ball life has to throw at us. How do you balance the emotional and hormonal ups and downs of teen romance with the possibility of your impending death?\n\nThe film is a bit monotonous in tone and starts to feel like a grind after a while. But again, it's worth seeing for the performances and for the unsentimental treatment of the subject matter that would have possibly segued into the maudlin in different hands. The ending scene is the most devastating thing I've seen in a movie this year.\n\nGrade: B+","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14022,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"MA-17","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2020-07-23","keywords":"pills,dog,teenage girl loses her hair,teenage girl wears a wig,hospital","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Babyteeth","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi678936601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzM2ODA5ZDItMjJjMS00ZTYxLTk3ODItOTNiMGEwZGQ2NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzM2ODA5ZDItMjJjMS00ZTYxLTk3ODItOTNiMGEwZGQ2NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7340546/","name":"Eliza Scanlen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9334013/","name":"Michelle Lotters","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3108675/","name":"Toby Wallace"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2221724/","name":"Shannon Murphy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0658237/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017733/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1514808/","name":"Rita Kalnejais"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This boisterous, big-hearted animated film is bursting with ideas and colour, stuffed to the brim with - one suspects - pretty much every idea that struck writer-director Jorge Gutierrez's fancy. Indeed, the final film plays very much like the charming but unpolished debut of a filmmaker who can't quite believe he was lucky enough to get the attention of producer Guillermo del Toro, and has no intention of wasting the opportunity in case it never comes around again. As a result, The Book Of Life practically trembles with too many ideas and influences, but remains so earnest and inventive that it's easy to forgive its predictable, overstuffed plot.\n\nIn a small Mexican town on the Day Of The Dead, we meet the protagonists of the story: steadfast, earnest Manolo (voiced by Diego Luna), who would rather strum a guitar than fight a bull in the tradition of his forefathers; brash, adventurous Joaquin (Channing Tatum), who becomes the town hero in trying to avenge the murder of his father by bandits; and spunky, intelligent Maria (Zoe Saldana), daughter of the mayor who inevitably wins the hearts of both young men. The stakes, however, are higher than they could ever imagine: the two godly rulers of the underworld, La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) and Xibalba (Ron Perlman), have gambled dominion over each other's lands on the outcome of the love triangle.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that there's a lot going on in The Book Of Life. The film covers everything from a mystical medal that lends invulnerability to anyone who wears it, to a tantalising love-hate relationship between the two gods, while spiced up with musical interludes galore. (It's not often that the film's hero will pause to belt out a soul-searching rendition of Radiohead's Creep, but that kind of thing happens all the time in The Book Of Life.) Mix it all up with retellings of Mexican folklore, including visits to the joyously colourful Land of the Remembered and the ghostly grey Land of the Forgotten, and the film can be a somewhat frenetic viewing experience, to say the least.\n\nBut, for all that Gutierrez packs his film full of ideas and details, he also manages to make most of it work very well. The love triangle may be trite, but there's nevertheless enough heart and humour holding Manolo, Maria and Joaquin together. Manolo's relationships with his dad Carlos (Hector Elizondo) and his departed mom Carmen (Ana de la Reguera) are coloured in with surprising depth as well. It's also wonderful to see a love triangle centred around a girl who knows her own mind - and rest assured that Maria speaks it often enough to make a real impact.\n\nThe Book Of Life also doubles as a very welcome riot of imagination and tradition. Every frame of the film is beautifully and thoughtfully designed, down to the fact that Manolo seems to have been intricately crafted out of wood. Moreover, instead of shying away from its Mexican roots to increase its global marketability, the film firmly embraces them. This gives Gutierrez room to craft some delicately dark moments in a graveyard or two, reminding everyone that those who have died can still live as long as they're remembered by the ones who loved them. And yet, the film never descends into darkness, instead tapping into the giddying energy of a fiesta - most memorably in a journey through the Land of the Remembered - complete with heady bursts of colour and music.\n\nThere's no denying that Gutierrez's film can occasionally be too much to handle. It's loud and almost cheerfully silly, tossing pop songs and Mexican folklore into a mix that sometimes doesn't work. But, at its best, The Book Of Life is like a rambunctious puppy: messy, loud and insistent, but radiating so much life and charm that it becomes quite impossible to resist.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-10-15","keywords":"afterlife,mexico,death character,bullfight,serenade","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi840674329","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Manolo, a young man who is torn between fulfilling the expectations of his family and following his heart, embarks on an adventure that spans three fantastical worlds where he must face his greatest fears.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0526019/","name":"Diego Luna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757855/","name":"Zoe Saldana"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1509613/","name":"Jorge R.

Mark Felt (Liam Neeson), aka "Deep Throat," is tag lined in the movie's title as "the man who brought down the White House." The 2005 Vanity Fair article finally told the story, and this rendition hints at much intrigue left untold. It's the other side of All the President's Men but not nearly as well done.\n\nAs the deputy associate director of the FBI, Felt knew so much that he couldn't be fired for fear he'd reveal all. Yes, he had control of Hoover's "private files" (lots of sexual indiscretions) after his death in 1972, and he had 31 years of service. To boot, he was a straight arrow whom the dirty tricksters in the White House should have feared.\n\nSo how could this be a dull story? In the first place, the secret actions by the Watergate burglars and the foul machinations of Nixon's henchmen are barely exposed as drama. More importantly, the seminal investigative gymnastics of Woodward and Bernstein are skimmed over in favor of a Dustin Hoffman lookalike (Julian Morris) as Woodward (Redford played it in All) looking star struck when Felt begins his covert revelations. More integral is Sandy Smith (Bruce Greenwood) of Time Magazine as felt unloads info on him as well.\n\nWhile we are left with a Cliff's Notes superficial version of the events leading to Nixon's resignation, we endure the domestic dilemmas of a boozy wife (Diane Lane) disappointed that Felt was passed over for director and a missing daughter, embarrassingly attached to a commune, we find out eventually. In the latter detail rests a better story of how Felt investigated Weatherman activities with a conflict of interest angle related to his daughter. (Reagan commuted Felt's sentence for unauthorized searches).\n\nThat is to say, there is so much action in those early '70's related to Tricky Dick that the movie seems to leave behind as it gets the right angles for its many Neeson close-ups. More close-ups of the FBI activity would have been better. All the President's Men and Spotlight are far better giving you the daily details leading to their disclosures.\n\nBut, hey, it is instructive to see that 45 years ago, the FBI asserted its independence from the White House. It had a sleazy administration to buck, all the more reason to fight the good fight. If you think there is resonance today with James Comey's firing, then hope for a Deep Throat. Looks like there are candidates already working out there."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12821,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-09-29","keywords":"washington post,whistleblower,father daughter relationship,mother daughter relationship,hippie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi52345113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MzAwNjg4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYxNjczMzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MzAwNjg4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYxNjczMzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Mark Felt, who under the name "Deep Throat" helped journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncover the Watergate scandal in 1974."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000178/","name":"Diane Lane"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190744/","name":"Marton Csokas"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1481618/","name":"Peter Landesman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0742273/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0515853/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0535275/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1944541/","name":"Mark Felt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2207084/","name":"John D.

Mark Felt (Liam Neeson), aka "Deep Throat," is tag lined in the movie's title as "the man who brought down the White House." The 2005 Vanity Fair article finally told the story, and this rendition hints at much intrigue left untold. It's the other side of All the President's Men but not nearly as well done.\n\nAs the deputy associate director of the FBI, Felt knew so much that he couldn't be fired for fear he'd reveal all. Yes, he had control of Hoover's "private files" (lots of sexual indiscretions) after his death in 1972, and he had 31 years of service. To boot, he was a straight arrow whom the dirty tricksters in the White House should have feared.\n\nSo how could this be a dull story? In the first place, the secret actions by the Watergate burglars and the foul machinations of Nixon's henchmen are barely exposed as drama. More importantly, the seminal investigative gymnastics of Woodward and Bernstein are skimmed over in favor of a Dustin Hoffman lookalike (Julian Morris) as Woodward (Redford played it in All) looking star struck when Felt begins his covert revelations. More integral is Sandy Smith (Bruce Greenwood) of Time Magazine as felt unloads info on him as well.\n\nWhile we are left with a Cliff's Notes superficial version of the events leading to Nixon's resignation, we endure the domestic dilemmas of a boozy wife (Diane Lane) disappointed that Felt was passed over for director and a missing daughter, embarrassingly attached to a commune, we find out eventually. In the latter detail rests a better story of how Felt investigated Weatherman activities with a conflict of interest angle related to his daughter. (Reagan commuted Felt's sentence for unauthorized searches).\n\nThat is to say, there is so much action in those early '70's related to Tricky Dick that the movie seems to leave behind as it gets the right angles for its many Neeson close-ups. More close-ups of the FBI activity would have been better. All the President's Men and Spotlight are far better giving you the daily details leading to their disclosures.\n\nBut, hey, it is instructive to see that 45 years ago, the FBI asserted its independence from the White House. It had a sleazy administration to buck, all the more reason to fight the good fight. If you think there is resonance today with James Comey's firing, then hope for a Deep Throat. Looks like there are candidates already working out there.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12821,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2017-09-29","keywords":"washington post,whistleblower,father daughter relationship,mother daughter relationship,hippie","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi52345113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MzAwNjg4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYxNjczMzI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MzAwNjg4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDYxNjczMzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Mark Felt, who under the name "Deep Throat" helped journalists Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncover the Watergate scandal in 1974.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000553/","name":"Liam Neeson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000178/","name":"Diane Lane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190744/","name":"Marton Csokas"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1481618/","name":"Peter Landesman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0742273/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0515853/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0535275/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1944541/","name":"Mark Felt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2207084/","name":"John D.

Go see this movie... it is a wonderful treat and a great time at the theatre.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6326,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-04-28","keywords":"small town,loser,adult filmmaking,pornographic film,hot","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Amateurs","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2207580441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmJkZDkwNzktZDNiMS00NzFhLThhYTktM2FhZDg5ODQ2ZjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmJkZDkwNzktZDNiMS00NzFhLThhYTktM2FhZDg5ODQ2ZjcyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Amateurs","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000313/","name":"Jeff Bridges","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001101/","name":"Ted Danson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001592/","name":"Joe Pantoliano"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0870592/","name":"Michael Traeger"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010508/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102795/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0107069/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0870592/","name":"Michael Traeger"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In fact, I adore it. For the simple motif than it is more than charming. It represents the best choice for the cat - dog owners and for the fans of romance in different form. The performances are great and the story - one of lovely crafted. Sure, it is an easy film but it has the rare gift to be, for its genre, a real gem.

If you don't mind action with lots of violence, then you will probably enjoy The Condemned. If you like Mary Poppins and romances, then don't watch this movie.

You will be hard pressed to find such awful acting anywhere as Miss Nielsen, 'veteran' director Richard Fleischer stumbles blindly through a non-existant plot, and you will feel absolutely no sympathy for either the good guys or the bad - in other words you just won't care!\n\nI would love to have hated this film - as a self-proclaimed 'movie-buff' this is the kind of film I should not even go near. But I'm loathed to admit...I enjoyed it! The two stars, amongst their awful acting, are actually quite engaging in a comedic way (intentional or not!). I began to relish the dialogue scenes just to see if a line could have been delivered with any more wood! The intentional comedy comes from a young prince (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his bodyguard (Paul Smith). Although I wished the prince to find the end of a sword as quickly as possible from his first scene, the interplay between these two characters was amusing, with some one-liners that could not have been more out of place in this film! The villainous queen (played by Sandahl Bergman) is unfortunately bland and forgettable. But one real treat for me was another completely out-of-place commodity - a great rousing score from maestro Ennio Morricone!\n\nThis was Schwarzenegger's return to his CONAN genre after hitting it big with THE TERMINATOR. It isn't too surprising that this was the last 'swords and sorcery' movie he did - but I promise you won't hate it!

You will be hard pressed to find such awful acting anywhere as Miss Nielsen, 'veteran' director Richard Fleischer stumbles blindly through a non-existant plot, and you will feel absolutely no sympathy for either the good guys or the bad - in other words you just won't care!\n\nI would love to have hated this film - as a self-proclaimed 'movie-buff' this is the kind of film I should not even go near. But I'm loathed to admit...I enjoyed it! The two stars, amongst their awful acting, are actually quite engaging in a comedic way (intentional or not!). I began to relish the dialogue scenes just to see if a line could have been delivered with any more wood! The intentional comedy comes from a young prince (Ernie Reyes Jr) and his bodyguard (Paul Smith). Although I wished the prince to find the end of a sword as quickly as possible from his first scene, the interplay between these two characters was amusing, with some one-liners that could not have been more out of place in this film! The villainous queen (played by Sandahl Bergman) is unfortunately bland and forgettable. But one real treat for me was another completely out-of-place commodity - a great rousing score from maestro Ennio Morricone!\n\nThis was Schwarzenegger's return to his CONAN genre after hitting it big with THE TERMINATOR. It isn't too surprising that this was the last 'swords and sorcery' movie he did - but I promise you won't hate it! You'll want to!....but you won't!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":40436,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"1985-07-03","keywords":"sword and sorcery,female nudity,redheaded woman,hyborian age,cult film","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Red Sonja","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2683485977","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ1ZmZmMjItNjk3ZS00MGFiLTgyMjQtYjFiYzlhNzViNzhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjQ1ZmZmMjItNjk3ZS00MGFiLTgyMjQtYjFiYzlhNzViNzhhXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000216/","name":"Arnold Schwarzenegger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000557/","name":"Brigitte Nielsen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000922/","name":"Sandahl Bergman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0281507/","name":"Richard Fleischer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0014380/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0036611/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0397574/","name":"Robert E.

The guy has been in every(I think) Highlander movie so far, despite the fact that only the first was particularly popular. He's done so many B-movies that one has to wonder if he is aware that the films are bad and doesn't care, or if he really doesn't realize their quality(or, rather, lack thereof). Here, he returns in a sequel to the fairly low-budget B-movie action-science fiction flick, Fortress. In the first one, the prison was huge, and underneath the ground. Here, it's... well, it's still huge, but this time, it's in outer space. I guess the writer thought, hey, the first time, it was underneath the ground... the only place that could be worse than that would be outer space. I hope he's right... I surely do, because if he is, maybe we won't see anymore half-cooked action-sci-fi flicks like this. Lambert portrays the exact same character, which I suppose is good, as he was a decent character in the first. A few somewhat big names also join the cast, most noticeably Pam Grier. The cast of characters from the first are pretty much remade(apart from Lambert himself), meaning that the new cast pretty much just fills the shoes of the characters from the first(anyone who knows how the first ended knows why). Unfortunately, that means that the film seems more like an overblown remake with the same guy portraying the lead, rather than a sequel. The hacker from the first(who was a neurotic, nervous guy, beautifully portrayed by great horror-talent, Jeffrey Combs) is replaced by an annoying black-guy stereotype. The female lead is replaced by a girl from the resistance(which Lambert's character is said to be a member of as well... odd... I don't remember that from the first... does that mean he joined the resistance after he got a kid? Who'd do that?), instead of his wife as it was in the first... apparently mainly because the scriptwriter couldn't find a good way to capture both Lambert and the wife-character, without capturing the kid. The Men-Tel prison commander(who was played by the cool bad-guy actor, Kurtwood Smith, from RoboCop fame) is now an annoying wimp with a ridiculous British accent that really gets on your nerves(as opposed to the cool Smith, who was a menacing and threatening presence). The plot is a rehash of the first. The pacing isn't particularly good. The very scenes in the movie seems to be(for the most part) remakes of the scenes of the original(talk about lack of originality...) and the action is mostly just rehashes of the first, just made a little less exciting(remember those way-cool machine guns with three barrels in the first? They're replaced with dull futuristic-looking stick-stun-guns). The special effects are decent at best. The script is a weak rehash of the first, with a few added sub-plots, none of which being particularly good... most of them are just there to keep the film going, or put it an action scene, in order to distract the audience from the poor writing. The dialog is pretty bad, with one or two exceptions. All in all, the film is just a tame rehash of everything the first was(which isn't even a lot). Somebody took the first film, said, "hey, this is popular... but it's not very good... how about if we try to do something of even lesser quality and see if people will like it?" Probably writer/producer/actor John Flock, who, going by the plot and the writing of this film, really is as dumb as he looks. I recommend this only to huge fans of the first Fortress, Lambert or B-movies. Everyone else; don't bother. There's a million better ways to spend 90 minutes, and there's at least as many reasons not to see this film. 5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6871,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2000-03-02","keywords":"punishment,dome,breasts,buttocks,female frontal nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fortress 2: Re-Entry","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1424294169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWZkNGZlZjAtZTE3Yi00OWZkLTgxNDYtMGZiN2I1NTI0YzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWZkNGZlZjAtZTE3Yi00OWZkLTgxNDYtMGZiN2I1NTI0YzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from TriStar Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000483/","name":"Christopher Lambert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0869728/","name":"Beth Toussaint"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308606/","name":"Willie Garson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614276/","name":"Geoff Murphy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048299/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058145/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270686/","name":"Steven Feinberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0624639/","name":"Troy Neighbors"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0282472/","name":"John Flock"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The guy has been in every(I think) Highlander movie so far, despite the fact that only the first was particularly popular. He's done so many B-movies that one has to wonder if he is aware that the films are bad and doesn't care, or if he really doesn't realize their quality(or, rather, lack thereof). Here, he returns in a sequel to the fairly low-budget B-movie action-science fiction flick, Fortress. In the first one, the prison was huge, and underneath the ground. Here, it's... well, it's still huge, but this time, it's in outer space. I guess the writer thought, hey, the first time, it was underneath the ground... the only place that could be worse than that would be outer space. I hope he's right... I surely do, because if he is, maybe we won't see anymore half-cooked action-sci-fi flicks like this. Lambert portrays the exact same character, which I suppose is good, as he was a decent character in the first. A few somewhat big names also join the cast, most noticeably Pam Grier. The cast of characters from the first are pretty much remade(apart from Lambert himself), meaning that the new cast pretty much just fills the shoes of the characters from the first(anyone who knows how the first ended knows why). Unfortunately, that means that the film seems more like an overblown remake with the same guy portraying the lead, rather than a sequel. The hacker from the first(who was a neurotic, nervous guy, beautifully portrayed by great horror-talent, Jeffrey Combs) is replaced by an annoying black-guy stereotype. The female lead is replaced by a girl from the resistance(which Lambert's character is said to be a member of as well... odd... I don't remember that from the first... does that mean he joined the resistance after he got a kid? Who'd do that?), instead of his wife as it was in the first... apparently mainly because the scriptwriter couldn't find a good way to capture both Lambert and the wife-character, without capturing the kid. The Men-Tel prison commander(who was played by the cool bad-guy actor, Kurtwood Smith, from RoboCop fame) is now an annoying wimp with a ridiculous British accent that really gets on your nerves(as opposed to the cool Smith, who was a menacing and threatening presence). The plot is a rehash of the first. The pacing isn't particularly good. The very scenes in the movie seems to be(for the most part) remakes of the scenes of the original(talk about lack of originality...) and the action is mostly just rehashes of the first, just made a little less exciting(remember those way-cool machine guns with three barrels in the first? They're replaced with dull futuristic-looking stick-stun-guns). The special effects are decent at best. The script is a weak rehash of the first, with a few added sub-plots, none of which being particularly good... most of them are just there to keep the film going, or put it an action scene, in order to distract the audience from the poor writing. The dialog is pretty bad, with one or two exceptions. All in all, the film is just a tame rehash of everything the first was(which isn't even a lot). Somebody took the first film, said, "hey, this is popular... but it's not very good... how about if we try to do something of even lesser quality and see if people will like it?" Probably writer/producer/actor John Flock, who, going by the plot and the writing of this film, really is as dumb as he looks. I recommend this only to huge fans of the first Fortress, Lambert or B-movies. Everyone else; don't bother. There's a million better ways to spend 90 minutes, and there's at least as many reasons not to see this film. 5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6871,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2000-03-02","keywords":"punishment,dome,breasts,buttocks,female frontal nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fortress 2: Re-Entry","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1424294169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWZkNGZlZjAtZTE3Yi00OWZkLTgxNDYtMGZiN2I1NTI0YzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWZkNGZlZjAtZTE3Yi00OWZkLTgxNDYtMGZiN2I1NTI0YzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from TriStar Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000483/","name":"Christopher Lambert","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0869728/","name":"Beth Toussaint","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308606/","name":"Willie Garson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614276/","name":"Geoff Murphy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048299/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058145/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080257/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270686/","name":"Steven Feinberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0624639/","name":"Troy Neighbors","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0282472/","name":"John Flock"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

For me, it was just as much fun as 'El Mariachi'. Rodriguez does what he does best. He already mentioned that his Mariachi films are a tribute to the western cinema that names like Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood defined and 'Desperado' works perfectly with its comic book story, quirky characters and over-the-top action sequences. Moving at a rapid pace, the direction and editing are top notch. The cinematography is brilliant too. Antonio Banderas does a good job taking over the role from Carlos Gallardo (who sort of plays his sidekick in this one).

All the female actresses, young and old, are absolutely terrific, and Adam Sandler does a respectable job in a semi-serious role. The writing is very clever, and the film will elicit laughter as well as tears. I found my self still thinking about the movie the next day, something that all too often doesn't happen with today's highly forgettable films. One caveat: this is really a movie for teens and up, not a kids' movie. Aside from a bad word or two and a (hilarious) sex scene, the underlying themes are quite adult.

Boy, was I surprised. This is a wonderful film, not at all the low-level fluff film I expected. All the female actresses, young and old, are absolutely terrific, and Adam Sandler does a respectable job in a semi-serious role. The writing is very clever, and the film will elicit laughter as well as tears. I found my self still thinking about the movie the next day, something that all too often doesn't happen with today's highly forgettable films. One caveat: this is really a movie for teens and up, not a kids' movie. Aside from a bad word or two and a (hilarious) sex scene, the underlying themes are quite adult. Enjoy!","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82078,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-12-17","keywords":"car,cadillac,cadillac escalade,jeep,jeep grand cherokee","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Spanglish","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi462029081","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE5MGJmNDktZDFmMS00NDY3LWE3YmEtYzdiMjU4MzM2MjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDE5MGJmNDktZDFmMS00NDY3LWE3YmEtYzdiMjU4MzM2MjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000495/","name":"Téa Leoni","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891895/","name":"Paz Vega"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000985/","name":"James L.

After all, Sandler's usual man-child character had to have somebody that he could relate to. Sandler portrays Sonny Koufax, a man who just might be the pure epitome of somebody who's not responsible. However, if that theory wasn't tested then there would be no film. In an effort to possibly win back his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) who has left him because of his being irresponsible and has since taken up with another man, he offers to be a guardian for his traveling roommate's (Jon Stewart) son, Julian (portrayed by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse). Agreeing to assume full responsibility for a child makes Sonny think that Swanson just might change her mind about leaving him. It doesn't happen and now child services won't let him return Julian. Sonny learns to grin and bear the situation by attempting to bond with Julian and in so doing, he gradually begins to feel more like an actual responsible father figure.

After all, Sandler's usual man-child character had to have somebody that he could relate to. Sandler portrays Sonny Koufax, a man who just might be the pure epitome of somebody who's not responsible. However, if that theory wasn't tested then there would be no film. In an effort to possibly win back his girlfriend (Kristy Swanson) who has left him because of his being irresponsible and has since taken up with another man, he offers to be a guardian for his traveling roommate's (Jon Stewart) son, Julian (portrayed by twins Cole and Dylan Sprouse). Agreeing to assume full responsibility for a child makes Sonny think that Swanson just might change her mind about leaving him. It doesn't happen and now child services won't let him return Julian. Sonny learns to grin and bear the situation by attempting to bond with Julian and in so doing, he gradually begins to feel more like an actual responsible father figure. Of course things get complicated when Stewart eventually returns home and a custody battle begins (Julian has grown attached to Sonny by this time). Even this dramatic seeming scene evolves into more adolescent comedy. Sandler's fans should enjoy this film but since I was never especially a fan of Sandler, I consider it to be just another crumbled up piece of paper in the sorry recent film comedy wastebasket.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":208500,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"1999-06-25","keywords":"responsibility,new york city,immaturity,adoption,hooters waitress","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Big Daddy","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi979346457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ZjZjZDAtNzFmZS00YzM3LWIzYzAtOThhZTU0NTA0YmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE1ZjZjZDAtNzFmZS00YzM3LWIzYzAtOThhZTU0NTA0YmI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Big Daddy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000725/","name":"Joey Lauren Adams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829537/","name":"Jon Stewart"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240797/","name":"Dennis Dugan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064748/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052395/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291692/","name":"Steve Franks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0379056/","name":"Tim Herlihy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001191/","name":"Adam Sandler"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I cannot make an honest opinion yet on the plots and direction of the series until I see more of it, but the imagery alone is a good start for this series.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71645,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-04-01","keywords":"sex scene,king,royalty,king henry viii,english court","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001667/","name":"Jonathan Rhys Meyers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0147147/","name":"Henry Cavill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0112390/","name":"Anthony Brophy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078130/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052980/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0082215/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0386694/","name":"Michael Hirst"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Tudors: Season 4: The Final Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3776092441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwY2E4Y2EtNmMyNy00MjFiLTg0ODgtNWVhMzhlYTQ0OTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwY2E4Y2EtNmMyNy00MjFiLTg0ODgtNWVhMzhlYTQ0OTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Tudors: The Final Season"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">Jerry Maguire: Directed by Cameron Crowe. With Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr., Renée Zellweger, Kelly Preston. When a sports agent has a moral epiphany and is fired for expressing it, he decides to put his new philosophy to the test as an independent agent with the only athlete who stays with him and his former colleague." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0116695/","name":"Jerry Maguire","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTM0ZWNmZTUtOTVkZS00MTZiLTg3M2QtZjA0Y2RmOWM1NWEyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_.jpg","description":"When a sports agent has a moral epiphany and is fired for expressing it, he decides to put his new philosophy to the test as an independent agent with the only athlete who stays with him and his former colleague.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0116695/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Travis_Bickle01"},"dateCreated":"2005-06-29","inLanguage":"English","name":"Only Cameron Crowe can make a movie like this","reviewBody":"I just finished watching this movie for the third time and I still love this movie as much as I did after the first time I watched it. Maybe even more! As I already said in the title of my review, only Cameron Crowe can make this kind of movies. Movies about life the way it is and life the way it should be. What I like the most about Crowe's work, is that everything is real. The characters, their emotions, the story,  The whole is absolutely amazing.\n\nTom Cruise gave an excellent performance as the sports agent with a heart. Someone for who money isn't the most important thing. It's all about the relationship between the sports agent and his client. What's so great about "Jerry Maguire", is the fact that the movie isn't about who Jerry Maguire really is, it's about who he wants to be. I loved Cuba Gooding Jr. By far his greatest role ever. Let's not forget Renée Zellweger and her cute son, amazingly performed by the young Jonathan Lipnicki. Both where very good. Perfect casting for Zellweger.\n\nI read in the trivia that the title role was written for Tom Hanks. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, but to play an ambitious and arrogant sports manager (what Jerry Maguire was at the beginning of the movie), you need to have Tom Cruise's face. He was just perfect for the role. I can't think of anybody who could have done this as good as he did.\n\nSo my conclusion for Jerry Maguire: If you haven't seen it, you should definitely see it. If you have seen it, I hope you can agree with me. This movie is wonderful, as where are used from Cameron Crowe-movies.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1996-12-13","keywords":"agent,sports agent,football,football player,reference to shaquille o'neal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Jerry Maguire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2527247897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E4YTVlYjgtZDk5My00MDk1LThlMjEtMzVlZTcxYmZmYWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E4YTVlYjgtZDk5My00MDk1LThlMjEtMzVlZTcxYmZmYWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000421/","name":"Cuba Gooding Jr."},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001081/","name":"Cameron Crowe"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035761/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001081/","name":"Cameron Crowe"}],"duration":"PT2H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Perfect casting for Zellweger.\n\nI read in the trivia that the title role was written for Tom Hanks. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, but to play an ambitious and arrogant sports manager (what Jerry Maguire was at the beginning of the movie), you need to have Tom Cruise's face.

Maybe even more! As I already said in the title of my review, only Cameron Crowe can make this kind of movies. Movies about life the way it is and life the way it should be. What I like the most about Crowe's work, is that everything is real. The characters, their emotions, the story,  The whole is absolutely amazing.\n\nTom Cruise gave an excellent performance as the sports agent with a heart. Someone for who money isn't the most important thing. It's all about the relationship between the sports agent and his client. What's so great about "Jerry Maguire", is the fact that the movie isn't about who Jerry Maguire really is, it's about who he wants to be. I loved Cuba Gooding Jr. By far his greatest role ever. Let's not forget Renée Zellweger and her cute son, amazingly performed by the young Jonathan Lipnicki. Both where very good. Perfect casting for Zellweger.\n\nI read in the trivia that the title role was written for Tom Hanks. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, but to play an ambitious and arrogant sports manager (what Jerry Maguire was at the beginning of the movie), you need to have Tom Cruise's face. He was just perfect for the role. I can't think of anybody who could have done this as good as he did.\n\nSo my conclusion for Jerry Maguire: If you haven't seen it, you should definitely see it. If you have seen it, I hope you can agree with me. This movie is wonderful, as where are used from Cameron Crowe-movies.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254211,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1996-12-13","keywords":"agent,sports agent,football,football player,reference to shaquille o'neal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Jerry Maguire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2527247897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E4YTVlYjgtZDk5My00MDk1LThlMjEtMzVlZTcxYmZmYWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E4YTVlYjgtZDk5My00MDk1LThlMjEtMzVlZTcxYmZmYWVhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000421/","name":"Cuba Gooding Jr."},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001081/","name":"Cameron Crowe"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035761/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001081/","name":"Cameron Crowe"}],"duration":"PT2H19M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Had they used a child's voice, lines such as "Let's get some apple juice down here!" would be merely cute; with Willis' smoky growl, they are hysterically funny.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":80777,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1989-10-13","keywords":"baby,birth,single mother,baby boy,new baby","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Look Who's Talking","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1168949017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTY1ZjQ3NmItNjJjOC00MDgyLWEyZWMtOGI1M2I2MTJlYTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTY1ZjQ3NmItNjJjOC00MDgyLWEyZWMtOGI1M2I2MTJlYTUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000237/","name":"John Travolta","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000263/","name":"Kirstie Alley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001156/","name":"Olympia Dukakis"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002132/","name":"Amy Heckerling"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024112/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0692605/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002132/","name":"Amy Heckerling"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It got a rave review in a Danish newspaper when it was doing the rounds here in March 2015, so my wife and I went to see it. Just beautifully filmed and acted - a very moving portrait of a people whom I knew nothing about previously. When I came out, I was on the verge of revising my choice of Fanny and Alexander as my favourite film; I was so in awe of what I had just seen. Sadly, Krzysztof Krauze, the co-director, died at Christmas 2014. I have been in touch with the Polish Film Institute to see if a DVD with English sub-titles is available, but it isn't yet, despite it being shown at the London Film Festival. Let's hope something is done about that - I'd buy several copies as gifts for friends. If you get a chance to see it, don't miss it. "Ida" deservedly got a lot of good reviews and even the Oscar for Best Foreign Film.

It got a rave review in a Danish newspaper when it was doing the rounds here in March 2015, so my wife and I went to see it. Just beautifully filmed and acted - a very moving portrait of a people whom I knew nothing about previously. When I came out, I was on the verge of revising my choice of Fanny and Alexander as my favourite film; I was so in awe of what I had just seen. Sadly, Krzysztof Krauze, the co-director, died at Christmas 2014. I have been in touch with the Polish Film Institute to see if a DVD with English sub-titles is available, but it isn't yet, despite it being shown at the London Film Festival. Let's hope something is done about that - I'd buy several copies as gifts for friends. If you get a chance to see it, don't miss it. "Ida" deservedly got a lot of good reviews and even the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. This one is much better.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-11-15","keywords":"character name as title,nickname as title,papusza character,poetess,title directed by female","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0591858/","name":"Jowita Budnik","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1138580/","name":"Zbigniew Walerys","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2252397/","name":"Antoni Pawlicki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1732806/","name":"Joanna Kos-Krauze","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470377/","name":"Krzysztof Krauze"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330220/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043688/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1732806/","name":"Joanna Kos-Krauze","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470377/","name":"Krzysztof Krauze"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Występ, który odbył się w czasie pandemii, musiał mieć dość kameralny charakter, ale mimo to muzycy przygotowali spektakularny show. Udowodnili, że wbrew niełatwym okolicznościom granie muzyki na żywo wciąż ma wielki sens.</desc>

After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.\n\nWhen they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.\n\nThe story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.\n\nThen there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.\n\nFantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today.

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted.

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish.

The worst is the daughter who decides to spit an criticize her kidnappers but her character was a bioche the whole way thru. BUT this is no worse than most of the movies that score 7 or even more out of 10. The one thing that really gets me is that at the end of the movie the director makes a big statement about rhinos &amp; other animals disappearing due to poaching. SERIOUSLY? This cheezy movie did nothing to raise the issue of poaching other than the fact that there was 5 minutes of poaching in the movie. P.s i still can't believe that rebecca stamos married that goofy charlie guy.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1242,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2021-05-28","keywords":"vacation,reference to exxon,zebra,africa,safari","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1341243417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTJkZjQxZmUtOTE4ZS00ODI0LWI2YzMtOTViYjA2ZjMwZmJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTJkZjQxZmUtOTE4ZS00ODI0LWI2YzMtOTViYjA2ZjMwZmJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A family on their dream vacation in Kenya find themselves in a fight for survival after their safari van flips over in a wilderness park.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005381/","name":"Rebecca Romijn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934618/","name":"Philip Winchester","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3932445/","name":"Isabel Bassett"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1068186/","name":"M.J.

The story places us in the disturbed head of our protagonist and we see his surreal version of the timeline and slowly descending into madness. From the very first frames, a surreal delirium of suggestions and the symbolic predominates over the laws of rationality. The narrative is reflected visually and metaphorically, and it succeeds in creating such disturbing experience with the scribbly style has an aesthetic at its best. Even the morbid images of human pet, ugly streets, the autopsy, bloody beaked birds, junk sea and the ship contain a right balance and it is not overdone just for the gore quotient. In addition, the music is staged for the surreal effect, stands on its own and manages to set the right accents. Also, I was surprised to see the voice for the old man in the train with the newspaper was done by late Andrzej Wajda.\n\nFinal thoughts, the film is a nightmare that gets under your skin visually and plays deep into the consciousness. I would say the film clearly owes a debt to David Lynch and this is not to criticise or say that I didn't love the experience. I did and it was Lynchian, sometimes it reminded me of demo tapes album art from 90s grindcore bands, a little of Ujichaa, little of David Shrigley or Roland Topor, and some Bill Plympton vibes all mixed into one that in several places is close to the grotesque and beautiful.

After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.\n\nWhen they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.\n\nThe story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.\n\nThen there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.\n\nFantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.\n\nWhen they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.\n\nThe story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.\n\nThen there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.\n\nFantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.\n\nThe scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.\n\nGreat film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars.

When an accident leaves them in a trauma. Where they face the past and current conflict with there relationship. They try to resolve there conflict that is holding them back.\n\nThe plot i can not say much more without going into spoiler territory. It was surprisingly good. A car accident affecting them both. Such as facing life after death. Dealing with loss and grief. And how a humans mind work itself in dealing with trauma. Adrienne and Matteo are dealing with a troubled relationship.

Producer of numerous Wajda's films including KATYN, Michal Kwiecinski in a witty directorial venture, EXTRAS, explores how modern men think of surrendering to Chinese Wave and drowning in its vast sea, when there's nothing left in his homeland, but a wasteland! A big yes to EXTRAS (2006) and its Homage to Love and Happy Ending! However in this enthusiastic farce, most of deductions seem absurd - for instance it is clear that if the Chinese director announces that, "Poland is second China and China is second Poland", the Polish photographer replies, "The situation is not good in Poland!!!" The absurdity is resonated in the duologue's of the melodrama they're shooting. The alienated Polish characters and enhancement of their relationship during the work are phenomenally inspiring, but the Chinese stereotypes - especially the childish director with his beloved goldfish - are not convincing at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-10-27","keywords":"town","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695835/","name":"Kinga Preis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115711/","name":"Stanislaw Brudny"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452609/","name":"Krzysztof Kiersznowski"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477187/","name":"Michal Kwiecinski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034872/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1008161/","name":"Jaroslaw Sokól"}],"duration":"PT1H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Producer of numerous Wajda's films including KATYN, Michal Kwiecinski in a witty directorial venture, EXTRAS, explores how modern men think of surrendering to Chinese Wave and drowning in its vast sea, when there's nothing left in his homeland, but a wasteland! A big yes to EXTRAS (2006) and its Homage to Love and Happy Ending! However in this enthusiastic farce, most of deductions seem absurd - for instance it is clear that if the Chinese director announces that, "Poland is second China and China is second Poland", the Polish photographer replies, "The situation is not good in Poland!!!" The absurdity is resonated in the duologue's of the melodrama they're shooting. The alienated Polish characters and enhancement of their relationship during the work are phenomenally inspiring, but the Chinese stereotypes - especially the childish director with his beloved goldfish - are not convincing at all.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":254,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-10-27","keywords":"town","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695835/","name":"Kinga Preis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115711/","name":"Stanislaw Brudny","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0452609/","name":"Krzysztof Kiersznowski"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477187/","name":"Michal Kwiecinski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034872/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1008161/","name":"Jaroslaw Sokól"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But experienced writer and director David Ayer failed miserably with his screenplay on what could've and should've been. I've seen amateur writers have tighter, more fluid, and logical screenplays. And it's a shame, because it really didn't need that much effort to fix. A few adjustments here and there, and/or better editing. Everything else was perfection.\n\nCasting and performances - especially LaBeouf, were so convincing, you felt it. Cinematography and score were flawless. Even Ayer's directing was decent, although the "good" scenes needed more/better/longer takes. But Geoffrey O'Brien's editing was horrible, and with the convoluted choppy screenplay, is what failed this film.\n\nI can't stand long films, especially when the story drags out, but I was left begging this screenplay had more much needed content and clarity in it, without taking out any of the current scenes. Another 20 mins added to the current 95 min runtime would have complimented and completed this little gem. Such a waste of everything else that was perfect.\n\nNevertheless, I am still shocked by the low ratings and bad reviews. I can only subtract 2 stars out of 10 for the horrible editing and lacking screenplay, because this could've easily been a perfect 10/10. So sadly, best it deserves is 8/10, because even with it's flaws, it's still one of the better films I've seen in a long time."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11920,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-08-07","keywords":"street,tattoo,gun,tax,tax collector","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1931263513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIwZjE1YmEtNGM1Zi00MDc0LWEwOTUtNzUyYmYyMmI2ZWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIwZjE1YmEtNGM1Zi00MDc0LWEwOTUtNzUyYmYyMmI2ZWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"David (Bobby Soto) and Creeper (Shia LaBeouf), are "tax collectors" for the crime lord Wizard, collecting his cut from the profits of local gangs' illicit dealings.

But experienced writer and director David Ayer failed miserably with his screenplay on what could've and should've been. I've seen amateur writers have tighter, more fluid, and logical screenplays. And it's a shame, because it really didn't need that much effort to fix. A few adjustments here and there, and/or better editing. Everything else was perfection.\n\nCasting and performances - especially LaBeouf, were so convincing, you felt it. Cinematography and score were flawless. Even Ayer's directing was decent, although the "good" scenes needed more/better/longer takes. But Geoffrey O'Brien's editing was horrible, and with the convoluted choppy screenplay, is what failed this film.\n\nI can't stand long films, especially when the story drags out, but I was left begging this screenplay had more much needed content and clarity in it, without taking out any of the current scenes. Another 20 mins added to the current 95 min runtime would have complimented and completed this little gem. Such a waste of everything else that was perfect.\n\nNevertheless, I am still shocked by the low ratings and bad reviews. I can only subtract 2 stars out of 10 for the horrible editing and lacking screenplay, because this could've easily been a perfect 10/10. So sadly, best it deserves is 8/10, because even with it's flaws, it's still one of the better films I've seen in a long time.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11920,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-08-07","keywords":"street,tattoo,gun,tax,tax collector","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1931263513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIwZjE1YmEtNGM1Zi00MDc0LWEwOTUtNzUyYmYyMmI2ZWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmIwZjE1YmEtNGM1Zi00MDc0LWEwOTUtNzUyYmYyMmI2ZWM4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"David (Bobby Soto) and Creeper (Shia LaBeouf), are "tax collectors" for the crime lord Wizard, collecting his cut from the profits of local gangs' illicit dealings.

Within three days of the assassination attempt on double agent and spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, key agencies discovered that a lethal nerve agent called Novichok was used, just half a teaspoon of which could kill 20,000 people. Within four days, hundreds of traces were found across the city, and, just when things were finally thought to be under control, a perfume bottle containing the nerve agent was discovered, throwing the investigation into renewed chaos."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This means that along with the beautiful autumn colors that emerge, the spooky season of Halloween also returns. Along with the jack o' lanterns, fun size candy, and parities, this is also when the often popular haunts come to town. These haunts cater to those that want something genuinely scary, as if they've stepped into their favorite horror movies...without the serial killers of course. I've only been to a few and have had more laughs then fears. This is because I more appreciate the haunts in a similar way a stage show is pulled off. \n\nSo why are there dedicated fans that keep going further with mazes where they tough you (yes, they can do that)? Again, it's a part of the Halloween atmosphere that a part of the escapism people desire. We already know were going to survive the night, but we love to see if our internal suspension of disbelief can activate and put us in the fear we want. I can understand it can be too intense for a lot of people, but again, it's all a part of the season. It's nice to see a movie like Hell Fest to set a slasher within a haunt park.\n\nA young college student Natalie (Played by Amy Forsyth) is visiting her former roommate Brooke (played by Reign Edwards) and classmate Taylor (played by Bex Taylor-Klaus). Not only are they going to the haunt park Hell Fest, but their meeting up with friends, including Gavin (played by Robby Attal) who got everyone V.I.P. passes (which means no line waiting). Along with the various people coming in, they see that Hell Fest of full of scare actors, several mazes to explore and even an entire land called "the Deadlands" where the actors are allowed to touch and go further with their scares. \n\nThe problem? An unnamed person enters the park and into the mazes and starts randomly killing off guests. Our heroes don't see anything wrong until this guy acquires a mask and starts to stalk them around. At first they dismiss him as a really good actor, but when friends start disappearing, they got more uneasy. Even when they try talking to security (who tells them that he can arrest someone for doing their job), they don't seem to have a lot of options. The further they get to the Deadlands, the more they feel like they've descended into hell.\n\nSo by reading this, you can already tell that Hell Fest follows a lot of slasher tropes that we've seen before; the group of college kids, unresponsive authority, walking along somewhere, killer with a mask, and such. This will definitely not appeal to those looking for a new kind of horror movie (like Hereditary). This seems to be more proud that it's trying to be a typical slasher. Because of that, I didn't mind it. A lot of it has to do with it's setting and atmosphere.\n\nHell Fest is full of theme park-like Halloween imagery that looks really cool. I was afraid they would try to pull off haunt mazes that only Hollywood effects teams were capable of. Instead, each maze has the right balance of over the top gory, but also over the top fakery. This feels like something that would be built at Knott's Berry Farm or Universal Studios. Part of me really wants to visit this place...without the killing of course. Even the scare actors seems spot on with some coming up to them at random points, and some in full makeup hosting scary shows about guillotines.\n\nStory is minimal as the what's served is an excuse to show off the park. The main actors like Amy Forsyth and Bex Taylor-Klaus do fine in their parts. Their interesting enough that we'd want to visit the park with them. Even when they are eventually chased by the killer (I swear, I don't even think they gave him a name), we do want to see them survive. Also like a lot of slashers, without giving anything away, it does tease for a potential sequel in a trope manner we've seen before. I'd, however, would love to see this continue.\n\nI'll give this seven tickets to Knott's Scary Farm out of ten. Hell Fest may be a typical slasher, but it's so atmospheric, that those that have been to these haunts will probably like it fine. It's hard to phrase it or be critical as it's also short, running no more then eighty-five minutes. It's a fun watch. So see it and understand it's all a prt of the show.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16182,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-09-28","keywords":"amusement park,haunted house attraction,masked killer,slasher,group of friends","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Band Teaser Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1220655897","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3YzNhYWEtMTc4ZS00OTE3LTkzMDMtY2NlODlhMTc2NmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3YzNhYWEtMTc4ZS00OTE3LTkzMDMtY2NlODlhMTc2NmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A masked serial killer turns a horror themed amusement park into his own personal playground, terrorizing a group of friends while the rest of the patrons believe that it is all part of the show."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6407242/","name":"Cynthea Mercado"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4806678/","name":"Stephen Conroy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5046593/","name":"Amy Forsyth"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687427/","name":"Gregory Plotkin"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047306/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164393/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092570/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3466037/","name":"Seth M.

So see it and understand it's all a prt of the show.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":16182,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-09-28","keywords":"amusement park,haunted house attraction,masked killer,slasher,group of friends","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Green Band Teaser Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1220655897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3YzNhYWEtMTc4ZS00OTE3LTkzMDMtY2NlODlhMTc2NmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjE3YzNhYWEtMTc4ZS00OTE3LTkzMDMtY2NlODlhMTc2NmM1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A masked serial killer turns a horror themed amusement park into his own personal playground, terrorizing a group of friends while the rest of the patrons believe that it is all part of the show.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6407242/","name":"Cynthea Mercado","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4806678/","name":"Stephen Conroy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5046593/","name":"Amy Forsyth"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0687427/","name":"Gregory Plotkin"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047306/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164393/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0092570/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3466037/","name":"Seth M.

    <desc lang="pl">Mistrzowie domowej kuchni poznają prawdę o swoim kulinarnym talencie. Bohaterem każdego odcinka jest osoba zgłoszona przez rodzinę. Każdy myśli, że został wybrany ze względu na swoje zdolności. Tymczasem okazuje się, że bliscy mają już dość przesolonej lasagne, mdłej pomidorówki lub twardych schabowych, ale boją się powiedzieć to wprost kucharzowi amatorowi. Znany szef kuchni Andrzej Polan ocenia umiejętności swoich gości i pomaga im podszkolić się w trudnej sztuce gotowania.</desc>

It got a rave review in a Danish newspaper when it was doing the rounds here in March 2015, so my wife and I went to see it. Just beautifully filmed and acted - a very moving portrait of a people whom I knew nothing about previously. When I came out, I was on the verge of revising my choice of Fanny and Alexander as my favourite film; I was so in awe of what I had just seen. Sadly, Krzysztof Krauze, the co-director, died at Christmas 2014. I have been in touch with the Polish Film Institute to see if a DVD with English sub-titles is available, but it isn't yet, despite it being shown at the London Film Festival.

It got a rave review in a Danish newspaper when it was doing the rounds here in March 2015, so my wife and I went to see it. Just beautifully filmed and acted - a very moving portrait of a people whom I knew nothing about previously. When I came out, I was on the verge of revising my choice of Fanny and Alexander as my favourite film; I was so in awe of what I had just seen. Sadly, Krzysztof Krauze, the co-director, died at Christmas 2014. I have been in touch with the Polish Film Institute to see if a DVD with English sub-titles is available, but it isn't yet, despite it being shown at the London Film Festival.

Występ, który odbył się w czasie pandemii, musiał mieć dość kameralny charakter, ale mimo to muzycy przygotowali spektakularny show. Udowodnili, że wbrew niełatwym okolicznościom granie muzyki na żywo wciąż ma wielki sens.</desc>

Although there are times when it looks a bit like Inside Out and Toy Story, the ending feels empty and the closing is unsatisfactory.\n\nIt is a movie with a good message about growing up and with a good story to tell, but the ending ruins what was previously built.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1149,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2020-02-12","keywords":"night","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [English SUB]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3936402969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM5ZGU3M2QtMjMyYS00NDJlLTgyZGUtN2I4NmMxYjliYmYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzM5ZGU3M2QtMjMyYS00NDJlLTgyZGUtN2I4NmMxYjliYmYwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1082477/","name":"Omar Sy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0067367/","name":"Bérénice Bejo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1460782/","name":"François Damiens"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0371890/","name":"Michel Hazanavicius"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0775436/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022869/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1315212/","name":"Bruno Merle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4380548/","name":"Noé Debré","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0371890/","name":"Michel Hazanavicius"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B.

An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair.

The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all.

There is a lot of stories and emotions connected to the making of this project. The journey surely was not an easy ride for the polish animator who lost his long-time friend and music collaborator Tadeusz Nalepa during the process.\n\nBriefly to the plot, I would say it as a mixture of dreams and memories of Wilczynski's upbringing in the industrial town of Lodz in the 60's and 70s during the dehumanization of life under Communist Poland. The filmmaker himself is part of the play and appears as an obese nude giant and recalls his parents and the socio-political situation in the communist Poland. The story places us in the disturbed head of our protagonist and we see his surreal version of the timeline and slowly descending into madness. From the very first frames, a surreal delirium of suggestions and the symbolic predominates over the laws of rationality. The narrative is reflected visually and metaphorically, and it succeeds in creating such disturbing experience with the scribbly style has an aesthetic at its best. Even the morbid images of human pet, ugly streets, the autopsy, bloody beaked birds, junk sea and the ship contain a right balance and it is not overdone just for the gore quotient. In addition, the music is staged for the surreal effect, stands on its own and manages to set the right accents. Also, I was surprised to see the voice for the old man in the train with the newspaper was done by late Andrzej Wajda.\n\nFinal thoughts, the film is a nightmare that gets under your skin visually and plays deep into the consciousness. I would say the film clearly owes a debt to David Lynch and this is not to criticise or say that I didn't love the experience. I did and it was Lynchian, sometimes it reminded me of demo tapes album art from 90s grindcore bands, a little of Ujichaa, little of David Shrigley or Roland Topor, and some Bill Plympton vibes all mixed into one that in several places is close to the grotesque and beautiful. To the fans who possess a love for surrealism and adore the aforementioned artists, check it out I highly recommend that you do so.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":695,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"genre":["Animation","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-03-05","keywords":"hero","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi642563609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlNmYyMDItYjdmNS00NTJmLTkyYWQtNTNjM2RkMTFkNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlNmYyMDItYjdmNS00NTJmLTkyYWQtNTNjM2RkMTFkNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417370/","name":"Krystyna Janda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161607/","name":"Andrzej Chyra"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652292/","name":"Maja Ostaszewska"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1295507/","name":"Mariusz Wilczynski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0799710/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0723136/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0704662/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1295507/","name":"Mariusz Wilczynski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1294751/","name":"Agnieszka Scibior"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I would say the film clearly owes a debt to David Lynch and this is not to criticise or say that I didn't love the experience. I did and it was Lynchian, sometimes it reminded me of demo tapes album art from 90s grindcore bands, a little of Ujichaa, little of David Shrigley or Roland Topor, and some Bill Plympton vibes all mixed into one that in several places is close to the grotesque and beautiful. To the fans who possess a love for surrealism and adore the aforementioned artists, check it out I highly recommend that you do so.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":695,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"genre":["Animation","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-03-05","keywords":"hero","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi642563609","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlNmYyMDItYjdmNS00NTJmLTkyYWQtNTNjM2RkMTFkNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzdlNmYyMDItYjdmNS00NTJmLTkyYWQtNTNjM2RkMTFkNGM0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0417370/","name":"Krystyna Janda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0161607/","name":"Andrzej Chyra","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652292/","name":"Maja Ostaszewska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1295507/","name":"Mariusz Wilczynski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0799710/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0723136/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0704662/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1295507/","name":"Mariusz Wilczynski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1294751/","name":"Agnieszka Scibior"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.\n\nWhen they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.\n\nThe story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.\n\nThen there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet.

After the atrocious Batman &amp; Robin, Batman was brilliantly brought back to the big screen in Batman Begins. When the Spider-Man franchise hit an embarrassing rock bottom with Spider-Man 3, it was reinvigorated with the very likable The Amazing Spider-Man. \n\nEight years on from the dud that was Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer and it's time that Marvel's first family got a reboot. With a lot of rumours flying around about trouble on set and the studio not seeming to have total confidence in their product, could 2015's Fantastic Four do these iconic comic-book characters justice?\n\nReed Richards (Miles Teller) is a brilliant young scientist on the verge of discovering how to both transport matter to another dimension and bring it back. Recruited by Professor Franklin Storm (Reg E. Cathey), Reed is given the resources and help, in the form of Sue Storm (Kate Mara), Victor Von Doom (Toby Kebbell) and Johnny Storm (Michael B. Jordan), to to finish what he started in his younger years.\n\nWhen they finally crack inter-dimensional travel, Reed invites his childhood friend Ben Grimm (Jamie Bell) to travel to another world along with him and his team. An accident causes their physical form to drastically change. Reed, Sue, Johnny and Ben must learn to harness their powers and work as a team to stop Victor, who is hell bent on destroying Earth.\n\nThe one thing that stood out to me about Fantastic Four is just how unbelievably dull it is. For characters who have such a rich and colourful history in the comics, this really is a pretty drab affair. The film only has a 100 minute runtime however, it feels much longer, dragging its feet and feeling very tired right from the very start.\n\nWhen a superhero movie gets less exciting after they get their powers, something is very very wrong.\n\nI had some hope for this film and one of the main reason was down to the fact that Josh Trank was sat in the director's chair. Trank hit the big time with Chronicle, a film that combined the superhero genre with found footage. I can't express just how disappointed I am with Trank because everything about Fantastic Four is just so sloppy.\n\nThe story is weak, the script is cringeworthy and the special effects are average at best. It all culminates in one of the most boring finales you will ever witness in a superhero movie. Compared to what else you see happen in other superhero movies these days, it all looks and feels amateur.\n\nThen there are the performances. Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, Jamie Bell and Toby Kebbell are all young actors who have the world at their feet. They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.\n\nFantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

That person is trying to change the world for the better and, with the help, support and vision of the youth of today (and a few others), let's wish her success in her crusade against greed, corruption and ignorance while joining her in the fight for our survival!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7484,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Documentary","Biography"],"datePublished":"2020-10-16","keywords":"environmental activist,climate crisis,teenage girl,female activist,global warming","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1000980761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmOWQzMWQtMGIwZS00ZjVmLWE0YzItODIwNzU2ZWQzNDFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGZmOWQzMWQtMGIwZS00ZjVmLWE0YzItODIwNzU2ZWQzNDFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"This documentary follows teenage climate activist Greta Thunberg on her international crusade to get people to listen to scientists about the world's environmental problems.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10361418/","name":"Greta Thunberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2468871/","name":"Svante Thunberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12524895/","name":"Niclas Svenningsen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5548363/","name":"Nathan Grossman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0337495/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0218858/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075650/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2408218/","name":"Hanna Lejonqvist","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0456599/","name":"Per K.

If you know that already, then you've got nothing to wait for.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":406,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-11-04","keywords":"boy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11075664/","name":"Damir Onackis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11075665/","name":"Luize Birkenberga","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0904474/","name":"Indra Burkovska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1797523/","name":"Dace Puce"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0616930/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11069042/","name":"Jana Egle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9413330/","name":"Monta Gagane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1797523/","name":"Dace Puce"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Leonardo DiCaprio made Gatsby his own ("Old spor'!") while retaining a feeling of familiarity. The screenplay was a faithful adaptation and even helped me understand some of the novel's themes more clearly. And though you'd think hearing dubstep during the Jazz Age would be jarring, the soundtrack worked very well.\n\nBut I couldn't love it. And it's (mostly) Tobey Maguire's fault.\n\nGatsby loomed so large in the original story that it's not hard to forget all about Nick. But it can be argued, and often is, that it was Nick and not Gatsby who was the protagonist of the novel. Fitgerald's story, told from Nick's first-person point of view, was only as good as Nick's narration; Gatsby was only so great because Nick viewed him that way.\n\nUnfortunately, Maguire fell completely flat in his role as narrative guide. There was always so much else going on and so much of Luhrmann's dreamscape to absorb that Maguire seemed to get lost in it all. And — with him — so did the viewer. Without a strong presence from Maguire, Nick was relegated from having a role as interpreter of events to being just another character (and a rather unimportant one at that).\n\nLuhrmann tried to maintain Nick's narrative frame by having him tell the story — first as a patient speaking to his doctor at a sanitarium, then as a writer trying to explain his grief through prose. But those scenes came across (at best) as heavy-handed expository or (at worst) as Maguire's uninspired take on an abridged audiobook version of "The Great Gatsby."\n\nI wanted to love this film. I really did. It had so many wonderful qualities. But with no Nick (only a Tobey) to help make sense of the people and events, "angry, and half in love with {it}, and tremendously sorry, I turned away."","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":508080,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-05-15","keywords":"extramarital affair,obsessive love,party,fatal accident,1920s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2949817881","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1ODU0Njg4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY2MTYzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1ODU0Njg4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY2MTYzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Midwestern war veteran finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor.

The screenplay was a faithful adaptation and even helped me understand some of the novel's themes more clearly. And though you'd think hearing dubstep during the Jazz Age would be jarring, the soundtrack worked very well.\n\nBut I couldn't love it. And it's (mostly) Tobey Maguire's fault.\n\nGatsby loomed so large in the original story that it's not hard to forget all about Nick. But it can be argued, and often is, that it was Nick and not Gatsby who was the protagonist of the novel. Fitgerald's story, told from Nick's first-person point of view, was only as good as Nick's narration; Gatsby was only so great because Nick viewed him that way.\n\nUnfortunately, Maguire fell completely flat in his role as narrative guide. There was always so much else going on and so much of Luhrmann's dreamscape to absorb that Maguire seemed to get lost in it all. And — with him — so did the viewer. Without a strong presence from Maguire, Nick was relegated from having a role as interpreter of events to being just another character (and a rather unimportant one at that).\n\nLuhrmann tried to maintain Nick's narrative frame by having him tell the story — first as a patient speaking to his doctor at a sanitarium, then as a writer trying to explain his grief through prose. But those scenes came across (at best) as heavy-handed expository or (at worst) as Maguire's uninspired take on an abridged audiobook version of "The Great Gatsby."\n\nI wanted to love this film. I really did. It had so many wonderful qualities. But with no Nick (only a Tobey) to help make sense of the people and events, "angry, and half in love with it, and tremendously sorry, I turned away."","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":508080,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-05-15","keywords":"extramarital affair,obsessive love,party,fatal accident,1920s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2949817881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1ODU0Njg4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY2MTYzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1ODU0Njg4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY2MTYzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Midwestern war veteran finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor.

A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!---------------------------------\n\n************May Contain a Couple MINOR Spoilers************** The TV promo trailer for "The Weather Man" did nothing to capture my interest. It looked like another of those "Light" comedies, which usually just aren't that good. Via recommendations from a few of my students, I decided to check it out. Wow!..Sometimes Hollywood marketing teams are so utterly clueless! In this case, the trailer shown on TV and the film projected in the theater had absolutely nothing in common with one another!\n\nDirector Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ring) has given us a film that at first glance seems simple enough, but which ends up being as absolutely unpredictable as the science of meteorology itself. David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced meteorologist who has attained considerable success on a professional level, but whose personal life, despite his perpetual fantasies to the contrary, is an explosive and unmitigated disaster.\n\nAs the perturbed and ever-reflexive protagonist, Nicolas Cage (National Treasure, Lord of War) positions himself in the eye of his own tormented life, and is likewise the title character of the film. Like almost every other human being, Spritz is unable to come to grips with the stark reality that the dark clouds constantly present in his life are creations of his own device. They are clearly the consequence of his own actions and his particularly obstinate way of being and not merely products of some uncontrollable, mystical fate.\n\nWhile growing up, young David always loomed in the shadow of his famous Pulitzer-Prize winning father, Robert Spritz, played masterfully by Michael Caine. It seems that communication between father and son was never really what it should have been. Similarly, David leaves a lot to be desired in the area of warm and communicative interaction with all the important people in his life: His son, daughter, and of course, his ex- wife.

A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!---------------------------------\n\n************May Contain a Couple MINOR Spoilers************** The TV promo trailer for "The Weather Man" did nothing to capture my interest. It looked like another of those "Light" comedies, which usually just aren't that good. Via recommendations from a few of my students, I decided to check it out. Wow!..Sometimes Hollywood marketing teams are so utterly clueless! In this case, the trailer shown on TV and the film projected in the theater had absolutely nothing in common with one another!\n\nDirector Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ring) has given us a film that at first glance seems simple enough, but which ends up being as absolutely unpredictable as the science of meteorology itself. David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced meteorologist who has attained considerable success on a professional level, but whose personal life, despite his perpetual fantasies to the contrary, is an explosive and unmitigated disaster.\n\nAs the perturbed and ever-reflexive protagonist, Nicolas Cage (National Treasure, Lord of War) positions himself in the eye of his own tormented life, and is likewise the title character of the film. Like almost every other human being, Spritz is unable to come to grips with the stark reality that the dark clouds constantly present in his life are creations of his own device. They are clearly the consequence of his own actions and his particularly obstinate way of being and not merely products of some uncontrollable, mystical fate.\n\nWhile growing up, young David always loomed in the shadow of his famous Pulitzer-Prize winning father, Robert Spritz, played masterfully by Michael Caine. It seems that communication between father and son was never really what it should have been. Similarly, David leaves a lot to be desired in the area of warm and communicative interaction with all the important people in his life: His son, daughter, and of course, his ex- wife. David's disconnect is that he fantasizes that love and affection from his loved ones is linked directly to his level of professional success and recognition.\n\nThe Weather Man, despite being a great European style film, suffers from some excesses. In order to drive home the fact that David often walks rather aimlessly through life, it isn't indispensable to permit the film to meander and lose its focus for a few minutes as well! Nor do I believe that the constant, non-stop profanity to be consistent with the characters nor with the overall tone of the film.

Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.\n\nVisually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2191662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Whilst extremely complex, the 'science' allowing the story to unfold is explained for the most part, although I imagine everyone loses the plot on a first viewing at some point, for me I was okay until the very final Saito scene. It keeps you engaged throughout and I think (?) you're routing for the right people, although in reality the overarching reason to undergo the entire film is a little weak, possibly skimmed over, and purely a vehicle to discover the world of dreams.\n\nVisually it cannot be faulted, and the pairing with the music works excellently as well. You're constantly drawn into the film without it ever being something that will get your heart racing, more interesting than compelling. Having said that, it is really one of a kind, at least at this level, and so everyone should see Inception, if only to appreciate the depth Nolan went into.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2191662,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2010-07-14","keywords":"dream,ambiguous ending,subconscious,surprise ending,mindbender","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"10th Anniversary Dream Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2959588889","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1ZmIzOTAtNDcwZi00NDVkLWE4NWItYWNhZGY1MmVlZGU0XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"A thief who steals corporate secrets through the use of dream-sharing technology is given the inverse task of planting an idea into the mind of a C.E.O.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0330687/","name":"Joseph Gordon-Levitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0680983/","name":"Elliot Page"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I actually thought it was better than Ian Fleming's novel (quite a few of the movies adapted from his books are better than them, in my opinion). I thought it started out pretty well but it did kind of lose steam by the end in my opinion.\n\nI liked Christopher Lee and Maud Adams. Roger Moore's my favorite Bond but I didn't like him here as much as in just about all his other movies. Britt Ekland was okay but not great. And I'm usually easily pleased by most Bond girls (I actually liked Tanya Roberts's character in A View to a Kill).\n\nThe climax was pretty disappointing. The fight between Bond and Scaramanga should have gone on longer. The flying car was kind of dumb. And I thought it was kind of pointless to have Sheriff J.W. Pepper in this movie. And I was kind of hoping he'd meet that kid somehow and give him the 20,000 bahts (it is a Roger Moore Bond movie, after all, so it's not like it would have been an unbelievable coincidence).\n\nOverall, it wasn't wonderful but not that bad either.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":101467,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1974-12-20","keywords":"secret agent,official james bond series,assassin,mission,female martial artist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2754854681","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FkOGI3NTMtMWQ3Ny00ZjIyLWE1NzYtZDYyZjE2NDc3MDQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FkOGI3NTMtMWQ3Ny00ZjIyLWE1NzYtZDYyZjE2NDc3MDQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000549/","name":"Roger Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000489/","name":"Christopher Lee"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001180/","name":"Britt Ekland"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542539/","name":"Tom Mankiewicz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I actually thought it was better than Ian Fleming's novel (quite a few of the movies adapted from his books are better than them, in my opinion). I thought it started out pretty well but it did kind of lose steam by the end in my opinion.\n\nI liked Christopher Lee and Maud Adams. Roger Moore's my favorite Bond but I didn't like him here as much as in just about all his other movies. Britt Ekland was okay but not great. And I'm usually easily pleased by most Bond girls (I actually liked Tanya Roberts's character in A View to a Kill).\n\nThe climax was pretty disappointing. The fight between Bond and Scaramanga should have gone on longer. The flying car was kind of dumb. And I thought it was kind of pointless to have Sheriff J.W. Pepper in this movie. And I was kind of hoping he'd meet that kid somehow and give him the 20,000 bahts (it is a Roger Moore Bond movie, after all, so it's not like it would have been an unbelievable coincidence).\n\nOverall, it wasn't wonderful but not that bad either.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":101467,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1974-12-20","keywords":"secret agent,official james bond series,assassin,mission,female martial artist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2754854681","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FkOGI3NTMtMWQ3Ny00ZjIyLWE1NzYtZDYyZjE2NDc3MDQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2FkOGI3NTMtMWQ3Ny00ZjIyLWE1NzYtZDYyZjE2NDc3MDQ5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000549/","name":"Roger Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000489/","name":"Christopher Lee","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001180/","name":"Britt Ekland"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0357891/","name":"Guy Hamilton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0537363/","name":"Richard Maibaum","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0542539/","name":"Tom Mankiewicz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

"You know what I want to think of myself," he said, "as a human being." Bruce Lee was a man who spent his entire life building bridges; between styles of martial arts, between cultures at odds with one another, and between inner and external philosophies. He felt that true strength comes from within, and that by recognizing that strength, as well as all the flaws that coexist alongside it, one can achieve greatness despite all odds. Bruce Lee is a hero worth idolizing because he did not see himself as one. He did not view himself as a star, or a saint. He was true to himself, accepting the good with the bad. He was confident, but not conceited, wise, but not condescending.

"You know what I want to think of myself," he said, "as a human being." Bruce Lee was a man who spent his entire life building bridges; between styles of martial arts, between cultures at odds with one another, and between inner and external philosophies. He felt that true strength comes from within, and that by recognizing that strength, as well as all the flaws that coexist alongside it, one can achieve greatness despite all odds. Bruce Lee is a hero worth idolizing because he did not see himself as one. He did not view himself as a star, or a saint. He was true to himself, accepting the good with the bad. He was confident, but not conceited, wise, but not condescending. He was a man who fought for all he achieved, and deserved every ounce of his success.\n\nIt is essential, given the current climate of racial injustice in the United States, that a documentary about a man who played such a role in dismantling prejudice against Asian-Americans take all the racial factors involved into full consideration and treat them respectfully and knowledgeably, and this documentary does exactly that.

He works as a parking lot attendant in New York, and is content to sit in his booth at night writing down passionate, articulate rants, so that when he goes home he can call a local radio sports show and prove his fanaticism for the Giants, his favorite football team.\n\nPaul is played by Patton Oswalt, one of the funniest stand-up comedians alive, and what he does in this film is really quite remarkable. He creates a fully convincing and pathetic loser, and is unafraid to reveal all the character's lowest points. If this were an Adam Sandler comedy we'd probably have scenes showing us how misunderstood and sweet Paul is, so we can understand that he's the one we're meant to root for, but Oswalt's Paul isn't so cleancut. He treats his family like crap and has terrible mood swings; he only seems truly happy when he's in his element: either witnessing a Giants win or ranting to strangers on the radio. The fact that he must write his speeches down beforehand, and preps himself for hours in advance of calling, says everything.\n\nPaul gets in trouble when he spots a Giants quarterback at a gas station in a shady neighborhood and follows him into a NYC nightclub. After an awkward introduction, Paul makes the mistake of mentioning that he's been following the sports star and his entourage for the past few hours, and the drunken athlete reacts by beating him senseless. Three days later Paul is hospitalized and the police want his statement -- but he suddenly "can't remember" anything that happened, desperately hoping the Giants won't be forced to suspend their star athlete. But that's just the beginning of his problems.\n\nBig Fan is the directorial debut of Robert D. Siegel, who wrote last year's sports-themed The Wrestler. Both movies concern the plights of apparent losers, the biggest difference being Mickey Rourke's 'Ram' actually had a life at one point, whereas Paul's existence is experienced vicariously. Everyone around him tries to offer a better life, whether it's jobs or moving into his own place, but he firmly rejects them. In Paul's eyes, this is his life. He is perfectly content to be discontent, and the movie's lack of transformation for its character will undoubtedly alienate some viewers.\n\nAnd, put bluntly, Big Fan is not as strong or poignant as The Wrestler. Siegel is not as capable a director as Darren Aronofsky, and the story -- despite clocking in at under an hour and a half -- does tend to meander a few times. But it is endearingly bleak, honest and real, and kept afloat by Oswalt's fascinating performance, which is hard to shake off even after the credits are over.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-09-18","keywords":"dark humor,man wears underwear,adult child lives at home,new york giants football,new york city","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652663/","name":"Patton Oswalt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180984/","name":"Kevin Corrigan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001650/","name":"Michael Rapaport"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1557909/","name":"Robert Siegel"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0130608/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0266284/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251178/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1557909/","name":"Robert Siegel"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The story was inspired by true events.\n\nAugusta-Victoria College for Girls was located in Bexhill-On-Sea, and served as a finishing school for the daughters of the German elite from 1932 through 1939. We open as the school's English teacher, Mr. Wheatley (Nigel Lindsay), frantically flees when he realizes his undercover mission has been discovered. An artistically filmed sequence on the boardwalk ends with Wheatley missing and his bowler floating off on the horizon. We don't know yet what he uncovered, but Thomas Miller (co-writer Eddie Izzard) is quickly hired as the new teacher by Headmistress Miss Rocholl (Oscar winner Dame Judi Dench).\n\nTeacher Ilse Keller (Carla Juri) puts the girls through their robotic lessons and ensures they listen to Nazi propaganda on the radio. Of course, as in most spy thrillers, no one is as they seem - or at least most aren't. Most of the girls seem indistinguishable from each other, save for dark-haired and bespectacled Gretel (Tijan Marei), who is a true outcast. The girls are referred to as the "Hitler League of German Girls" and are being educated and groomed for the planned new socialist nation.\n\nIt doesn't take Miller long to uncover a plan, and almost immediately, he's wrongly accused of murder - sending him on the run. It's no spoiler to reveal that Miller is part of British Intelligence, and in the role, Izzard delivers a more restrained performance than what we are accustomed to (see OCEAN'S TWELVE and OCEAN'S THIRTEEN ... and it's very effective.

This offers us a bit of cat and mouse between Drey and Miller, and they are joined in the fun by Charlie the bus driver, played by the always interesting Jim Broadbent.\n\nThe plan to evacuate the girls before the war seems a bit overly complicated, but then my experience planning such war time strategy is admittedly non-existent. Still, the lead characters and the setting make this intriguing enough, and cinematographer Chris Seager certainly has some fun with camera angles.

An epic war of wills ensues in the unassuming battleground of their suburban home as they each reckon with private tragedies -- and pursue their personal passions.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230826/","name":"Monica Dolan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5994881/","name":"Earl Cave","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4169846/","name":"Elliot Speller-Gillott"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3020713/","name":"Simon Bird"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0436913/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0495802/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0604063/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10709085/","name":"Lisa Owens","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3680249/","name":"Joff Winterhart"],"duration":"PT1H26M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A detailed synopsis will actually diminish the experience in my opinion. The film is a black and white production set in 1960s Oklahoma. The story is centrally about an unlikely relationship between two young women. That's as much as you need to know.\n\nFrom a technical perspective, the depth of field was above average even for a studio production. As an independent film, the photography earns extra points. The production was shot on location so we can't talk about set design. However, the costumes and staging were pretty spectacular too.\n\nI was a little disappointed to learn the film was dual-chromatic. Meaning the producers and director essentially shot both in color and non-color before deciding which cut to release. The film wasn't exclusively crafted as a black and white film. On the upside though, the director obviously took care enough to ensure everything contrasted well in black and white from the beginning. The contrast is very well done and obviously extensively planned.\n\nThe best part of the film is probably the performances though. Kara Hayward steals the show in my opinion. However, there is such a long list of supporting roles it's hard to say which one is best. Liana Liberato deserves a mention as an essential co-star but the list really doesn't end there. If I had to level any criticism, I'd say the male performances didn't really keep up.\n\nThe difference probably relates more to writing than how the actors were portrayed but the difference is noticeable. All the male characters, with maybe one exception, are decidedly two dimensional. The female characters, whether by acting or writing, display a lot more depth and interest for the viewer. The distinction was obviously intentional. However, there is a problem.\n\nWithout giving anything away, the sheer volume of depth almost overwhelms the film at some points. I feel as though there were too many interesting plot lines to explore. The film might have accomplished more with less. Instead, I encountered some odd cropped scenes where you're left wondering where some of the ideas came or went.\n\nNot exactly continuity glitches. More like questions left hanging. I won't tell you the details. Suffices to say though, the climax of the film ends up feeling a bit rushed and most of the sub-plots leave the film feeling inconclusive. One loose end was certainly intentional. However, I'm talking about the film as a whole.\n\nGo watch and enjoy. The film is a lot more successful than not. If you have the time, you should ask yourself where the title came from. That's one of those explained loose ends.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1508,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-04-24","keywords":"lesbian,platonic lesbian love,1960s,oklahoma,school bullying","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4288658969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmU3YWVhYzktYTFhZS00MjUyLTk0ZGUtYjJiNDdlYTFjZjUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmU3YWVhYzktYTFhZS00MjUyLTk0ZGUtYjJiNDdlYTFjZjUwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Under small town scrutiny, a withdrawn farmer's daughter forges an intimate friendship with a worldly but reckless new girl in 1960s Oklahoma."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4442319/","name":"Kara Hayward"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0819079/","name":"Jordana Spiro"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0662669/","name":"Tina Parker"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1387503/","name":"Martha Stephens"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0309207/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0593332/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0748635/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9323529/","name":"Shannon Bradley-Colleary"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

"The Danish Girl" is also in its way a film about torture, but more akin to the mental torture seen in films like "Buried" or "Flightpath". What must it be like to be trapped with a sexual orientation that you feel is not your own? To possess physical body parts you don't believe you should have? And all in a time (the 1920's) when an exposed ankle was considered slightly daring.\n\nBased on a true story, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne ("The Theory of Everything") and Alicia Vikander ("Ex Machina") play a bohemian married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. Einar is a renowned landscape artist with his wife a struggling portrait artist living in his shadow. After taking part in a cross-dressing modelling session, strong feelings are awakened in Einar. As a bit of a 'game' Gerda encourages him to explore the character of his alter-ego "Lili" further: a big mistake, as Einar is swept into a spiral of confusion and self-doubt.\n\nEddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar-nomination for his brave performance as Einar/Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect and delivering a truly heart-rending performance. With all this said however, I never quite believed I was watching the character of Lili but more Redmayne acting the character. Perhaps this is unfair, as Einar/Lili is such a bizarrely multi-dimensional person no one could perhaps have played him/her to my satisfaction. But I suspect (particularly as Redmayne won last year) this won't bring Redmayne the Oscar double. \n\nFar more impressive for me was the delicious and delightful Alicia Vikander, once more turning in a fantastic performance as the increasingly desperate (both psychologically and sexually) Gerda. With Rooney Mara, Vikander must be one of the brightest actress talents in today's cinema. \n\nAlso turning in a strong performance, in what is a very limited cast list, is Matthias Schoenaerts ("Far from the Madding Crowd") as a Parisian art dealer with a link to Einar's past. The omni-present (sorry, that should read "hard-working") Ben Whishaw turns up again as a party guest with an unhealthy interest in Lili and Sebastian Koch (most recently seen in series 5 of "Homeland") plays Dr Warnekros who is a pioneer in the new and risky business of sexual reassignment surgery.\n\nAnother star of the film is the luscious Danish capital, filmed in vibrant colours, as if from the artists' palettes, by Danny Cohen, a Hooper favourite. Also a big surprise to me was the gloriously photographed Danish countryside, seen at the end of the film, with mountains and seascapes I never knew existed.\n\nAnother Hooper alumni, Alexandre Desplat, supplies the soupy but very fitting score.\n\nWhile the film features a compelling story and much impressive acting, I never personally felt as connected to the story as I was to "The King's Speech". This isn't helped by a rather stagy script by Lucinda Coxon that feels lightweight at times. Perhaps its because we are in Oscar- season but, to me, it all felt a tad pretentious and (no pun intended) could have done with a few snips in places to reduce the running time by 15 minutes or so.

"The Danish Girl" is also in its way a film about torture, but more akin to the mental torture seen in films like "Buried" or "Flightpath". What must it be like to be trapped with a sexual orientation that you feel is not your own? To possess physical body parts you don't believe you should have? And all in a time (the 1920's) when an exposed ankle was considered slightly daring.\n\nBased on a true story, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne ("The Theory of Everything") and Alicia Vikander ("Ex Machina") play a bohemian married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. Einar is a renowned landscape artist with his wife a struggling portrait artist living in his shadow. After taking part in a cross-dressing modelling session, strong feelings are awakened in Einar. As a bit of a 'game' Gerda encourages him to explore the character of his alter-ego "Lili" further: a big mistake, as Einar is swept into a spiral of confusion and self-doubt.\n\nEddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar-nomination for his brave performance as Einar/Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect and delivering a truly heart-rending performance. With all this said however, I never quite believed I was watching the character of Lili but more Redmayne acting the character. Perhaps this is unfair, as Einar/Lili is such a bizarrely multi-dimensional person no one could perhaps have played him/her to my satisfaction. But I suspect (particularly as Redmayne won last year) this won't bring Redmayne the Oscar double. \n\nFar more impressive for me was the delicious and delightful Alicia Vikander, once more turning in a fantastic performance as the increasingly desperate (both psychologically and sexually) Gerda. With Rooney Mara, Vikander must be one of the brightest actress talents in today's cinema. \n\nAlso turning in a strong performance, in what is a very limited cast list, is Matthias Schoenaerts ("Far from the Madding Crowd") as a Parisian art dealer with a link to Einar's past. The omni-present (sorry, that should read "hard-working") Ben Whishaw turns up again as a party guest with an unhealthy interest in Lili and Sebastian Koch (most recently seen in series 5 of "Homeland") plays Dr Warnekros who is a pioneer in the new and risky business of sexual reassignment surgery.\n\nAnother star of the film is the luscious Danish capital, filmed in vibrant colours, as if from the artists' palettes, by Danny Cohen, a Hooper favourite. Also a big surprise to me was the gloriously photographed Danish countryside, seen at the end of the film, with mountains and seascapes I never knew existed.\n\nAnother Hooper alumni, Alexandre Desplat, supplies the soupy but very fitting score.\n\nWhile the film features a compelling story and much impressive acting, I never personally felt as connected to the story as I was to "The King's Speech". This isn't helped by a rather stagy script by Lucinda Coxon that feels lightweight at times. Perhaps its because we are in Oscar- season but, to me, it all felt a tad pretentious and (no pun intended) could have done with a few snips in places to reduce the running time by 15 minutes or so. That being said, and as an alternative view, I should point out that my wife was in tears for a good proportion of the film and disagrees vehemently with my views. I say "my wife", but since watching the film she's started wearing braces and smoking cigars – so I'm rather confused as to WHAT exactly is going on. :-)\n\n(For the graphical version of this review, see bob-the-movie-man.com.

I was not all that excited about seeing it in the first place myself if I am going to be honest, but I only got it because there was nothing better to get I guess, and in the end, I had a fun time with it. Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz have good chemistry on set, not exactly Gone with the Wind type of romance, but enough to make it feel somewhat believable and make these characters interact well with the plot.\n\nThe movie is quite humorous. Not one of the funniest or even most memorable Rom-Coms I have ever seen, but here again, it does not try to be anything more than it is. The story is cute and entertaining if you give it even the slightest bit of chance to be, and though I would say if you are looking for a Rom-Com for you and your significant other there are plenty of better ones like The Proposal and The Ugly Truth you could see, if you have any interest in seeing this, I encourage you to do it because if you know what you are in for, it will be just what you needed.

I was not all that excited about seeing it in the first place myself if I am going to be honest, but I only got it because there was nothing better to get I guess, and in the end, I had a fun time with it. Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz have good chemistry on set, not exactly Gone with the Wind type of romance, but enough to make it feel somewhat believable and make these characters interact well with the plot.\n\nThe movie is quite humorous. Not one of the funniest or even most memorable Rom-Coms I have ever seen, but here again, it does not try to be anything more than it is. The story is cute and entertaining if you give it even the slightest bit of chance to be, and though I would say if you are looking for a Rom-Com for you and your significant other there are plenty of better ones like The Proposal and The Ugly Truth you could see, if you have any interest in seeing this, I encourage you to do it because if you know what you are in for, it will be just what you needed. A refreshing little movie that deserves better reception.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":170898,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-05-07","keywords":"jackpot,father son relationship,casino,neo screwball comedy,male and female protagonists","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What Happens in Vegas ...

If you're a Star Wars geek this movie totally is for you. Basically it's a movie about Star Wars geeks made by Star Wars geeks for a target audience of Star Wars geeks. If you are not into all things Star Wars this movie may well miss the mark with you. And even the most rabid of Star Wars fans would have to concede that the movie is certainly not anything spectacular. It's fairly charming and reasonably amusing but never really riotously funny. But it works. More or less.\n\nThe movie is set in the autumn of 1998, a time before Jar Jar Binks had been foisted upon the world. Four friends, major Star Wars geeks all, decide to drive across the country, break into Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of The Phantom Menace. The major motivation for this journey is that one of the friends has cancer and will not live to see the movie released. But once that is established the cancer storyline is basically put on the back burner and this turns into a mostly predictable wacky road-trip comedy. Some of the wackiness works, some of it falls flat. There are a bunch of celebrity cameos thrown in, some of which are inspired and some of which are rather random and pointless. So it's a movie which has its ups and downs. But it's enjoyable more often than not and the movie breezes by in a nice, tight, well-paced 90 minutes.\n\nNone of the actors playing our gang of four really stand out in any memorable way. Dan Fogler's character is a little more outrageous than the others but that's about it. But the group works together well and they are ably supported by the varied cast of characters who pop up throughout. Seth Rogen's portrayal of a pimp is one of the standouts. Of course this ode to Star Wars fans wouldn't be complete without taking some shots at Trekkies. So there's room for another funny turn by an actor portraying Admiral Seasholtz, an uber-Trekkie. Who is the unrecognizable actor memorably bringing this character to life? You may have to wait until the closing credits roll to figure it out.

If you're a Star Wars geek this movie totally is for you. Basically it's a movie about Star Wars geeks made by Star Wars geeks for a target audience of Star Wars geeks. If you are not into all things Star Wars this movie may well miss the mark with you. And even the most rabid of Star Wars fans would have to concede that the movie is certainly not anything spectacular. It's fairly charming and reasonably amusing but never really riotously funny. But it works. More or less.\n\nThe movie is set in the autumn of 1998, a time before Jar Jar Binks had been foisted upon the world. Four friends, major Star Wars geeks all, decide to drive across the country, break into Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of The Phantom Menace. The major motivation for this journey is that one of the friends has cancer and will not live to see the movie released. But once that is established the cancer storyline is basically put on the back burner and this turns into a mostly predictable wacky road-trip comedy. Some of the wackiness works, some of it falls flat. There are a bunch of celebrity cameos thrown in, some of which are inspired and some of which are rather random and pointless. So it's a movie which has its ups and downs. But it's enjoyable more often than not and the movie breezes by in a nice, tight, well-paced 90 minutes.\n\nNone of the actors playing our gang of four really stand out in any memorable way. Dan Fogler's character is a little more outrageous than the others but that's about it. But the group works together well and they are ably supported by the varied cast of characters who pop up throughout. Seth Rogen's portrayal of a pimp is one of the standouts. Of course this ode to Star Wars fans wouldn't be complete without taking some shots at Trekkies. So there's room for another funny turn by an actor portraying Admiral Seasholtz, an uber-Trekkie. Who is the unrecognizable actor memorably bringing this character to life? You may have to wait until the closing credits roll to figure it out. And in this Star Wars geek universe there's room for one girl and Kristen Bell is both charming and funny in the role as her character gets swept along for the ride. Could the movie be a little more consistently funny? Most definitely. But the movie about Star Wars geeks will probably leave you with a smile on your face. Especially if you're a Star Wars geek yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2009-02-13","keywords":"star wars fan film,blonde,princess lela bikini,white panties,scantily clad female","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fanboys","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3468690201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmODc3N2UtNzc0Ny00YWU4LTljYWEtMDNjNmQzNDJhY2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmODc3N2UtNzc0Ny00YWU4LTljYWEtMDNjNmQzNDJhY2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer: A group of anxious fans decide to break into Skywalker Ranch and steal an early print of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" for their friend who is suffering from cancer.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283945/","name":"Dan Fogler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059431/","name":"Jay Baruchel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068338/","name":"Kristen Bell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1381100/","name":"Kyle Newman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148949/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0244605/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2094392/","name":"Ernest Cline","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1104057/","name":"Adam F.

Rob asks at the very beginning of the film and it is here that Rob decides to investigate just how he is at fault to the 5 all time greatest break ups in his love life a la The Top 5s he and his co-horts in crime habitually categorize all things pertinent to music.  What follows is a laugh-filled introspection of the heart on its sleeve and its tongue sharply in cheek as to Rob's quest of finding all his faults and foibles in hope of wooing back his recent romantic dismissal that includes 5 prototypes of all heterosexual men: The First Kiss/Crush; The Adolescent Urgency/Loss of Virginity, The Woman Out of His League; The Rebound Best Friend/Possible Soul Mate and finally, The One True Love He Isn't Even Aware Of.\n\nThe approach may seem old hat and gimmicky (Cusack breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly into the camera) yet it isn't intrusive but enlightening into what the hero is really thinking and more importantly why.  Surrounded by a truly winning cast, Cusack shines once again as a likable average guy who is trying to remain a guy although the inner voice of Be A Man is palpable and reverberating inside.  His nonchalant, casual way of speaking and his slow burns are priceless (he finally takes out his frustrations on Laura's new beau, the unctious sensitive pony-tailed Ian played by Cusack's best bud and former co-star of `The Sure Thing' and the cult classic `Tapeheads', Robbins, in the film's funniest fantasy sequence of Rob, Barry and Dick pummeling Ian to death). Cusack's constant streak of the smart alecky good guy continues from the quintessential portrait of Lloyd Dobler, kickboxing student of the affairs of the heart in the classic `Say Anything.' and the previous purveyor of romantic comedy, Walter `Gib' Gibson in the update of `It Happened One Night', `The Sure Thing' to his hit-man Martin Blank pondering his high school reunion with dread in the black comedy  `Grosse Pointe Blank' (reunited here with his screenwriters/partners in crime D.V. De Vincentis, Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg).\n\nThe women portraying Rob's Girlfriends of Christmas Past , so to speak, are exemplery especially Taylor (another Cusack repertoire player, who played his best gal pal/voice of reason in `Anything.') as Sarah the rebound fling and Zeta-Jones as Charlie (showing some nice moments of sublime sardonicism), the sexy babe completely out of his element). Bonet has a few nice moments as local singer Marie De Salle who provides some unsubtle ways of bringing Rob to his senses.  Sister Joan provides some comic bile as well as mutual friend to Laura and Rob. But frankly it's a guy's flick and thanks to the boisterous Black (late of HBO's comedy series `Tenacious D' and a score of films as diverse as `Mars Attacks!' and last year's co-starring with Cusack in  `Cradle Will Rock') and geeky, quiet Louiso adding some color especially in their scenes together debating their varied choices of musical tastes.\n\nDirected by Stephen Frears, a fellow Englishman who appears to know the American arcana striking a responsive chord (he put Cusack through the paces in the neo-noir classic `The Grifters' a decade ago) allows his characters time to pace themselves from one setup to the next and skillfully keeps the smart patter gleaned from the book alive on screen.\n\nEasily one of the year's funniest films and finally  a film I whole heartedly recommend in what seemed to be dearth of mediocrity thus far in the new millennium.  To paraphrase the emergence of Bruce Springsteen (who has a funny cameo) into rock's pantheon I will allude this to comedy: I have seen the future and it is John Cusack.

I would say I had pretty low knowledge in films before I first saw Inside Out (not to say that I'm highly intelligent on films now). I only saw about 200 films prior. I hadn't seen a lot of classic films or even know that film can be an art form just through its camera work among other aspects. So you could say that I can't speak for everyone on my views of this film. And you may be right because opinions are subjective anyway.\n\nThis is my favourite film ever.\n\nLike I said above, I didn't see a lot of films that were deemed as masterpieces at that time. While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nYet this is still my favourite film of all-time.\n\n80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.\n\nEver since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).\n\nInside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.\n\nIn the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.\n\nYou can vote "not helpful" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway. This is a beautiful film that will resonate in me always.\n\nI will never forget Inside Out.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":660021,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-17","keywords":"joy,sadness,anger,memory,running away","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Theaters: June 19","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi203730969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inside Out is in theaters on June 19!"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688132/","name":"Amy Poehler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352778/","name":"Bill Hader"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085400/","name":"Lewis Black"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498834/","name":"Meg LeFauve"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.\n\nEver since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).\n\nInside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.\n\nIn the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.\n\nYou can vote "not helpful" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway. This is a beautiful film that will resonate in me always.\n\nI will never forget Inside Out.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":660021,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-17","keywords":"joy,sadness,anger,memory,running away","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Theaters: June 19","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi203730969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inside Out is in theaters on June 19!","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688132/","name":"Amy Poehler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352778/","name":"Bill Hader","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085400/","name":"Lewis Black"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498834/","name":"Meg LeFauve"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When you're down and out, the best shot is, simply, to   Go for it!","reviewBody":"When a doctor or a family member tells you that the only life you have ever know is over, that can be a pretty bitter pill too swallow. In Rocky V, Rocky Balboa is faced with such a scenario. This movie proves to me that you need to have more than one string to your arrow, as you never know when it might come in handy one day. Rocky V also points out that money and possession are not the important things in life, but family and (true) friends are!\n\nLosing it all does not mean a thing unless you've got something to lose  And Rocky Balboa had it all. Times have changed, though, for former Heavyweight champion of the world. A lifetime of fighting has taken its toll, mentally and physically, and the maneuverings of an scrupulous accountant have left him financially strapped. But resiliency and the ability to come back have been trademarks of the Rocky legend. Just when it looks like the champ is down for the count, he discovers the raw talent of a young fighter named Tommy Gunn, who just might be Rocky's last chance for glory. In a world where achievement is marked by dollars and cents, and in a profession where success is measured in wins and losses, Rocky Balboa knows that, whatever the struggle, your only hope is to give it your best shot.\n\n This film is probably the weakest of the five films in the Rocky series. Yet there are some very good parts to it. The way we see Rocky get over bankruptcy was very good, as is the way he eventually makes his family the most important thing in his life. Again I found this story to be good, though I guess it lacked that real Rocky feel to it, mainly because the champ was unwilling or unable to get into the ring. Stallone has done a grand job in being the writer of all the Rocky films. \n\nThe cast make a final appearance, that is reasonably good. Stallone is good as Rocky once again. His character is still trying to make a contribution to fighting, after being told that he can no longer professionally fight in the ring. So he helps out fresh talent, Tommy Machine' Gunn, who is acted by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. I found this character to be just far to arrogant and stubborn, which in a way did not suit being a part of the Balboa corner. Tommy has had an interesting life, not only fighting wise, but in a personal way. He has been caught in drug rackets, drink driving and admitted to the world that he has contracted the fatal HIV virus. I am not so sure he is the greatest of actors though.\n\nThe normal cast members were good. Talia Shire's character Adrian, lets the world know that her husband is finished boxing and has nothing else to prove in the boxing ring. Making a special appearance was star from the first three films, that of Burgess Meredith. Just seeing him onscreen was really satisfying. Mickey was a favourite character of mine. I must mention that I liked seeing Stallone's very own son Sage, in Rocky as Rocky's son, Rocky Jnr. He was pretty good as the son that felt left out in the cold. He also has a mean punch like the old man as well. \n\nI found that all the Rocky films had terrific soundtracks. This is due to the great work by composer, Bill Conti. Bill has done a wonderful job in organising the music to go with all the fighting scenes and the poignant scenes which require that tune to set them off just nicely. Rocky five had probably the best song on any of the soundtracks, that being the Elton John hit Measure of a man'. I think it is a wonderful song, with some terrific lyrics. I have loved most of the music that the Rocky movies have given us.\n\nRocky V might not be the best movie ever made, but it certainly had some sort of impact on me. I believe if a movie only makes a slight impression on you, then it has achieved in a small way what it was meant to do.

When you're down and out, the best shot is, simply, to   Go for it!","reviewBody":"When a doctor or a family member tells you that the only life you have ever know is over, that can be a pretty bitter pill too swallow. In Rocky V, Rocky Balboa is faced with such a scenario. This movie proves to me that you need to have more than one string to your arrow, as you never know when it might come in handy one day. Rocky V also points out that money and possession are not the important things in life, but family and (true) friends are!\n\nLosing it all does not mean a thing unless you've got something to lose  And Rocky Balboa had it all. Times have changed, though, for former Heavyweight champion of the world. A lifetime of fighting has taken its toll, mentally and physically, and the maneuverings of an scrupulous accountant have left him financially strapped. But resiliency and the ability to come back have been trademarks of the Rocky legend. Just when it looks like the champ is down for the count, he discovers the raw talent of a young fighter named Tommy Gunn, who just might be Rocky's last chance for glory. In a world where achievement is marked by dollars and cents, and in a profession where success is measured in wins and losses, Rocky Balboa knows that, whatever the struggle, your only hope is to give it your best shot.\n\n This film is probably the weakest of the five films in the Rocky series. Yet there are some very good parts to it. The way we see Rocky get over bankruptcy was very good, as is the way he eventually makes his family the most important thing in his life. Again I found this story to be good, though I guess it lacked that real Rocky feel to it, mainly because the champ was unwilling or unable to get into the ring. Stallone has done a grand job in being the writer of all the Rocky films. \n\nThe cast make a final appearance, that is reasonably good. Stallone is good as Rocky once again. His character is still trying to make a contribution to fighting, after being told that he can no longer professionally fight in the ring. So he helps out fresh talent, Tommy Machine' Gunn, who is acted by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. I found this character to be just far to arrogant and stubborn, which in a way did not suit being a part of the Balboa corner. Tommy has had an interesting life, not only fighting wise, but in a personal way. He has been caught in drug rackets, drink driving and admitted to the world that he has contracted the fatal HIV virus. I am not so sure he is the greatest of actors though.\n\nThe normal cast members were good. Talia Shire's character Adrian, lets the world know that her husband is finished boxing and has nothing else to prove in the boxing ring. Making a special appearance was star from the first three films, that of Burgess Meredith. Just seeing him onscreen was really satisfying. Mickey was a favourite character of mine. I must mention that I liked seeing Stallone's very own son Sage, in Rocky as Rocky's son, Rocky Jnr. He was pretty good as the son that felt left out in the cold. He also has a mean punch like the old man as well. \n\nI found that all the Rocky films had terrific soundtracks. This is due to the great work by composer, Bill Conti. Bill has done a wonderful job in organising the music to go with all the fighting scenes and the poignant scenes which require that tune to set them off just nicely. Rocky five had probably the best song on any of the soundtracks, that being the Elton John hit Measure of a man'. I think it is a wonderful song, with some terrific lyrics. I have loved most of the music that the Rocky movies have given us.\n\nRocky V might not be the best movie ever made, but it certainly had some sort of impact on me. I believe if a movie only makes a slight impression on you, then it has achieved in a small way what it was meant to do. I heard that plans for Rocky VI were being made, with a script finished by Stallone just a few years ago. Personally, I feel that if it was to be made it would not be that great a film, because Balboa can no longer make a comeback in the ring, and if he does, he could well become  as his wife said disabled'. All things being said, these films are a terrific avenue of motivation and can help any person get the spark back to turn their luck around in any venture they pursue.\n\nRating 3 Stars or 6.5/10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":132607,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1990-11-16","keywords":"rocky balboa jr character,rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,mickey goldmill character","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

The visuals were OK but could have been better especially Belle's village.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":290795,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-03-17","keywords":"beast,fairy tale,heroine,beast's heart,remake of oscar winner","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Consideration Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179222553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress.

Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.\n\nNot everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.\n\nFarming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, "we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it."

Yes, nearly every actor's performance proved worthy of commendation. McConaughey is on fire. Chastain is blossoming into a star. At this point Michael Cain exudes such knowledge and wisdom by merely appearing on screen that if he were cast as Albert Einstein, people would wonder if the role were beneath him. All this considered, and the sound still towered over everything.\n\nI walked out of the theater believing that I had experienced something unique, something truly special. Interstellar inspires, it awes, and above all it entertains. I cannot ask for more than that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1639478,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2014-11-07","keywords":"astronaut,saving the world,gravity,relativity,wormhole","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #4","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1586278169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5OTQzMTg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgyMjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5OTQzMTg4N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTgyMjM0NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A group of explorers make use of a newly discovered wormhole to surpass the limitations on human space travel and conquer the vast distances involved in an interstellar voyage.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000190/","name":"Matthew McConaughey"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004266/","name":"Anne Hathaway"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1567113/","name":"Jessica Chastain"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634300/","name":"Jonathan Nolan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.\n\nNot everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.\n\nFarming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous. Cooper (McConaughey) remains one of the few survivors who still appreciates the need for engineering. He feels like a man lost in time, until he stumbles into the headquarters of NASA (which had been operating in secret due to public disapproval). Here he meets others who realize that a return to our old ways is unsustainable and will ultimately lead to our demise. We need technology to save us. As Michael Caine, playing the brilliant (duh!) Professor Brand, eloquently tells Cooper, "we were never meant to save the world. We were meant to leave it." For a movie that won an Oscar for Best Visual Effects (and deservedly so) the sound stole the show. Hans Zimmer (Dark Knight Trilogy) unleashed a performance that was, quite appropriately, out of this world. Never have I seen a movie elevated so much by its score.

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...\n\nAt other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.\n\nApart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.\n\nAnd, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.\n\nChow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.\n\nThe center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the "Luke Skywalker" of the piece, if you will...though "Crouching Tiger..." has everything the "Star Wars" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.\n\nBy the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the "Full Peckinpaw," if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.\n\nThere are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!\n\nI won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.\n\nMy recommendation: Just go see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...\n\nAt other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.\n\nApart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.\n\nAnd, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.\n\nChow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.\n\nThe center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the "Luke Skywalker" of the piece, if you will...though "Crouching Tiger..." has everything the "Star Wars" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.\n\nBy the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the "Full Peckinpaw," if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.\n\nThere are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!\n\nI won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.\n\nMy recommendation: Just go see it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"],"duration":"PT2H"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The days of her famed discoveries behind her, she now hunts for common fossils to sell to rich tourists to support herself and her ailing widowed mother. When one such tourist, Roderick Murchison, arrives in Lyme on the first leg of a European tour, he entrusts Mary with the care of his young wife Charlotte, who is recuperating from a personal tragedy. Mary, whose life is a daily struggle on the poverty line, cannot afford to turn him down but, proud and relentlessly passionate about her work, she clashes with her unwanted guest.

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over.

I may be nearing 30, but I'm not ashamed to laugh at a sponge wearing square whitey tighties! Oh, and for those of us who never cease to mock David Hasselhoff - he has a cameo.

It was like watching an episode of Seinfeld when Kramer makes his first appearance of an episode and the studio audience goes crazy. I briefly thought about booing just for the fun of it, but the thought of a bunch of tiny little hands pattering me upon my face didn't sound too fun.\n\nBut let's go back to the whole "singing along to songs" bit. I think it's only fair to warn parents that this may start to drive you crazy after the movie. Good luck trying to keep your kid from singing, "I'm ready, promotion! I'm ready, promotion!" or "I'm a goofy goober, you're a goofy goober, we're all goofy goobers" over and over and over again. I had to bribe my 9-year-old brother with cold hard cash to knock it off with the "I'm ready, promotion!" song.\n\nSpeaking of my brother, I asked him after the movie which he preferred -SpongeBob or The Polar Express. To my surprise, he said SpongeBob because it was "funnier." I suppose this is a lesson that children aren't quite as impressed with fancy animation as adults are.\n\nBut he's right, SpongeBob is a funny movie in it's own quirky, original way. I'm not dying to see it again, and I don't think I'll be glued to the TV set every time it's on, but I enjoyed it, and I'm not gonna waste my time or yours by picking apart what I didn't like.

As Episode 1 opens, Sandra Russo and Robin Young introduce themselves: "I'm your mother", Russo says to the interviewer (and director) Ry Russo-Young. "And I'm your mother too", adds Young. We then go back in time to 1979, as these ladies retell how they met and fell heads over heels for each other and very soon moved in together. Through two sperm donors, each of them has a baby girl. The sperm donors agree to waive all rights (and obligations)... At this point we are 10 min into the opening episode.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest film from Ry Russo-Young ("Before I Fall", "The Sun Is Also a Star"). Here she examines her own life and background, being raised by two moms in the early 80s when that was anything but normal/accepted, even in New York. Both sperm donors are in California, and gave up all parenting and visitation rights, but as luck would have it, they are both on great terms with Russo and Young, and in particular Tom (biological father of Ry) develops strong a strong bond with Ry. What could possibly go wrong? This in turn leads to the question: who/what constitutes a family? Obviously the film maker has unfettered access to her moms, and the series (or at least Episode 1) plays out mostly from that perspective. I can't wait to see the remaining two episodes.\n\n"Nuclear family" premiered last Sunday on HBO and Episode 1 is now available on HBO on Demand, HBO Max and other streaming platforms. New episodes air on Sunday evenings at 10 pm Eastern time. If you have any interest in LGTBQ and related social issues, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2021-09-26","keywords":"tv mini series","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12980711/","name":"Cade Russo-Young"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1735543/","name":"Ry Russo-Young"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1096524/","name":"Jacob Estes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0600458/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208153/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139821/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1438499609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRhMjc1MWQtZjYzOS00MWNiLWE1OTctMGVlMTJhMzZmNjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRhMjc1MWQtZjYzOS00MWNiLWE1OTctMGVlMTJhMzZmNjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg","description":"Ry Russo-Young turns the camera on her own past to explore the meaning of family."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The timeline is set back to 1984. Skynet sends its own terminator from 2029, to kill Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), mother of future subversive leader of the resistance, John Connor (Jason Clarke). Consequently, a human, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is also sent to stop the terminator, in humanity's desperate hope to save their species. At the time, Sarah is already being protected by her guardian terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), whose reasons of arriving in her time, is seemingly set to be never known.\n\nTime-travel has always been a fascinating subject, and it in such fashion that Terminator: Genisys, attempts to build its own stronghold in the mold of the first two films. The take assumes an interesting onset, depicting an apocalyptic future where machines lord over the human minority, but it spirals down to fatal loops of nonsensical uncreatively-staged retreads when the what can be considered the inception of human salvation (Schwarzenegger's Terminator's arrival), begins. Once the deadly cat-and-mouse chases spin out of control, confusion begins, and the film itself, can't be bothered to clear off heads as it totally busy itself to trying to awe-inspire spectators, with elaborately-constructed action setpieces, teeming with CGI-mastered explosions, pursuits, and fight scenes. There's no denying that such attempt is carried out with colossal success, but the audience would inevitably find appreciating the feat, difficult and pointless . The proceedings are sutured into recreations of some iconic scenes of the original movies, while also devising its own, at the same time. But even with all these efforts, GENISYS still fails to generate sustained interest. The result of its motives manages to hit some of the nostalgic beats of the franchise, but tepid one-liners and confusing paradoxes would drag down its capacity to last. It is also by these narrative defects that interest is being stripped off its key players, making the audience barely care about the characters and the imminence of their extinction. This is why Genisys is way below the glory of its predecessors--the dread is barely present, and fear is forced, thus ineffective.\n\nThere is a screaming irony that bursts at the heels of this attempt to reinvigorate the sagging Terminator series: The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) returns to the past to save the whole of humankind, but the mess that is GENISYS, murders the franchise. 5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268924,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-07-08","keywords":"cyborg,future,sarah connor,time machine,human versus cyborg","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1249751321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MTg5OTExOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM0OTEzNTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MTg5OTExOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM0OTEzNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When John Connor, leader of the human resistance, sends Sgt.

At the time, Sarah is already being protected by her guardian terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), whose reasons of arriving in her time, is seemingly set to be never known.\n\nTime-travel has always been a fascinating subject, and it in such fashion that Terminator: Genisys, attempts to build its own stronghold in the mold of the first two films. The take assumes an interesting onset, depicting an apocalyptic future where machines lord over the human minority, but it spirals down to fatal loops of nonsensical uncreatively-staged retreads when the what can be considered the inception of human salvation (Schwarzenegger's Terminator's arrival), begins. Once the deadly cat-and-mouse chases spin out of control, confusion begins, and the film itself, can't be bothered to clear off heads as it totally busy itself to trying to awe-inspire spectators, with elaborately-constructed action setpieces, teeming with CGI-mastered explosions, pursuits, and fight scenes. There's no denying that such attempt is carried out with colossal success, but the audience would inevitably find appreciating the feat, difficult and pointless . The proceedings are sutured into recreations of some iconic scenes of the original movies, while also devising its own, at the same time. But even with all these efforts, GENISYS still fails to generate sustained interest. The result of its motives manages to hit some of the nostalgic beats of the franchise, but tepid one-liners and confusing paradoxes would drag down its capacity to last. It is also by these narrative defects that interest is being stripped off its key players, making the audience barely care about the characters and the imminence of their extinction. This is why Genisys is way below the glory of its predecessors--the dread is barely present, and fear is forced, thus ineffective.\n\nThere is a screaming irony that bursts at the heels of this attempt to reinvigorate the sagging Terminator series: The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) returns to the past to save the whole of humankind, but the mess that is GENISYS, murders the franchise. 5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268924,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-07-08","keywords":"cyborg,future,sarah connor,time machine,human versus cyborg","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1249751321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MTg5OTExOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM0OTEzNTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MTg5OTExOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM0OTEzNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When John Connor, leader of the human resistance, sends Sgt.

But, like "The Phantom Menace," I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was "How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?" rather than "How entertaining is this film overall?" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.\n\nCritics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like "The Wizard of Oz" and "Mary Poppins," are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.\n\nAs a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, "Adventures in Babysitting"), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.\n\nI had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like "Home Alone" and "Mrs. Doubtfire." Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.\n\nBut much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--"Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers"--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.\n\nNot that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.\n\nThe problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary "muggle" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.\n\nAlthough the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.\n\nThe answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.\n\nWhat we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":707053,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-01-16","keywords":"magic,wizard,school of magic,based on novel,orphan","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter Franchise Retrospective","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3286287129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRlYzU0YWMtYTU3My00ZmEyLWE1NzEtZTk1MDNmMzE2N2RhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1pYnJ5YW50._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRlYzU0YWMtYTU3My00ZmEyLWE1NzEtZTk1MDNmMzE2N2RhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1pYnJ5YW50._V1_.jpg","description":""That's why you're famous, Harry, that's why everybody knows your name.

But, like "The Phantom Menace," I've had a very hard time viewing it objectively. There was so much anticipation leading up to its release, I simply enjoyed the experience of being there. Having read all four books in the series a few times each, I am overly familiar with the events in the story. As I watched the movie, my continuing thought was "How well will the next part of the story be translated to the screen?" rather than "How entertaining is this film overall?" I have trouble answering the latter question because I was already entertained by watching a wonderful story dramatized, so I'll never know how I'd have reacted had I seen this movie without having read the books.\n\nCritics talk about how incredibly faithful the movie is to the book, and perhaps I'd have had an easier time detaching the two in my mind had the movie set off on its own course. Indeed, many classic children's movies, like "The Wizard of Oz" and "Mary Poppins," are so successful partly because they're so different from the books that inspired them. But these are exceptions; in my experience, most children's movies reveal their weaknesses in how they diverge from the books upon which they're based. And much of what makes the Harry Potter phenomenon unique is that it is the first time in ages that a children's book, without a movie accompanying it, has generated this much popularity. According to an article I read a year ago, the universe of Harry Potter has become as real in the minds of youngsters and adults as that of a popular movie series like Star Wars. Therefore, it will be very hard for any film based upon it to compete with it. In the minds of die-hard fans, any changes made to the story will be seen as desecrating the fantasy world that Rowling created. That's why it's easy to understand why the filmmakers were so reluctant to change anything.\n\nAs a faithful rendering of the book squeezed into a two-and-a-half hour period, the movie is beautifully done. I don't have a single complaint about any of the actors, who successfully bring to life, with the aid of costume design and special effects, the many colorful characters from the book. My favorite character, the giant Hagrid, is played by Robbie Coltrane, and I say with no exaggeration that he is exactly how I imagined him while reading the book. It's as if they took the image in my mind and transferred it to the screen. While I had my own personal image of Snape (for some reason, I always imagined him as the head villain from another Chris Columbus film, "Adventures in Babysitting"), Alan Rickman is perfect in the role. I usually expect to have words of criticism for some performances, but I just don't. The remaining adult actors, including Maggie Smith as Professor McGonagall and Richard Harris as Albus Dumbledore, are as good as they possibly could be, and the kids do an excellent job of holding their own against these veterans. Some have criticized Daniel Radcliffe for appearing too subdued in the title role, but that's exactly how the character is portrayed in the book: modest, unassuming, and laid-back. The kids who play Harry's two best friends are flawless.\n\nI had a lot of worries about the fact that it was being directed by Chris Columbus, whose entire directorial career so far has consisted of over-the-top slapstick films. I was pleasantly surprised that he did not direct the Harry Potter film in this way. Except for brief moments like the children's delayed reaction to a giant three-headed dog they encounter and Harry's swallowing the quaffle ball, there is nothing here to remind us that this film is directed by the same person who gave us films like "Home Alone" and "Mrs. Doubtfire." Indeed, I think Columbus may have gone just a tad bit too far in trying not to make the film seem cartoony. I would have liked to see a little more emotion on the actors' faces at certain times. Overall, however, his restraint works nicely in giving the film the kind of believability the book possesses.\n\nBut much is left out. Harry's caretaker Uncle Vernon, a prominent character in the book, is given less attention in the movie than some of the bit characters. The gently satirical aspects of Hogwarts School aren't in the movie at all. We never see the ghostly history teacher who died several years back but kept on teaching. Lines like the following--"Professor McGonagall watched [her students] turn a mouse into a snuffbox--points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers"--find no equivalent in the movie. The movie does include platform nine-and-three-quarters, though the way the kids disappear into the wall isn't as mysterious as I had visualized, and the sorting hat is there, minus the great poem explaining the differences between the four schools.\n\nNot that I'm blaming the movie for omitting some details. Some things from the book would not have translated easily to the screen, and it would have been very difficult to stick everything in. Had Columbus done so and allowed the film to be as long as necessary (eight hours, maybe?), like a BBC miniseries, the film might have been a masterpiece, but few kids would ever have had the patience or attention span to sit through it.\n\nThe problem is that the amusing details are much of what make Harry Potter such a special story. A whole universe is created in Rowling's series, in which a magical society exists within our own ordinary "muggle" world and is kept secret by a bureaucracy with its own rules, history and politics. The way magic is treated in her books, not as something medieval but as very similar to the way our own contemporary world works, is a large part of their charm. Take away these details, and you're left with a fairly conventional tale of a young wizard fighting an evil sorcerer.\n\nAlthough the audience I was with broke into applause as soon as the movie ended (something I've never seen happen before, though I don't go to the theater that often), some people have complained about the movie dragging at certain points. I didn't have that problem, but, as I said, I wasn't really trying to get involved in the movie's story. After thinking about it, it does seem like parts of the movie fail to convey a sense of urgency. Why should this be? I never felt that way when reading the books, and this is without a doubt the very same story.\n\nThe answer, I think, is that the books portray much of Harry's anxiety in trying to succeed in school (for if he's kicked out, he'll go straight back to his horrible uncle) and fit in with the kids there. The movie doesn't tap into these anxieties enough, so why should we care whether he wins the Quidditch match (other than that he survives in one piece) and gets through the school year? The only real suspense in the movie after he arrives at Hogwarts comes from the story of Lord Voldemort returning, which in the book is almost secondary. Harry's adventures getting along in the school are fun and interesting, but as they are presented to us in the film, there isn't enough tying them all together.\n\nWhat we have here is a serviceable dramatization of a wonderful children's series, but it doesn't entirely succeed in standing on its own. Perhaps it should have diverged from the book just a little, to compensate for the difficulties in translating some of the book's delights to the screen. In its current form, it's almost like a preview of the book. Its lack of fullness, and its dependence on the book, might actually increase the popularity and endurance of Rowling's series by making those who see the film yearn for more, which they can get from the real thing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":707053,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2002-01-16","keywords":"magic,wizard,school of magic,based on novel,orphan","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter Franchise Retrospective","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3286287129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRlYzU0YWMtYTU3My00ZmEyLWE1NzEtZTk1MDNmMzE2N2RhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1pYnJ5YW50._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDRlYzU0YWMtYTU3My00ZmEyLWE1NzEtZTk1MDNmMzE2N2RhXkEyXkFqcGdeQW1pYnJ5YW50._V1_.jpg","description":""That's why you're famous, Harry, that's why everybody knows your name.

In 'Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban', the trio are now thirteen and beginning their Third Year at Hogwarts, under the fear of an escaped criminal who played a part in the deaths of Harry's parents and seems to be stalking the school, preying on Harry.\n\nThe child acting in this film has improved slightly with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint probably faring the best in comparison to their young co-stars. Although he is lumbered with a Ron who has once again been reduced to a comic character, it's a sign of Grint's abilities that he does well without looking embarrassed or too clownish. Dan Radcliffe was still very poor, obviously struggling to portray Harry's darker emotions in a manner that isn't wooden and awkward and and this was very apparent in the scene where he makes an atrocious effort to cry when he finds out his godfather had betrayed his parents to their deaths. while Tom Felton was let down by poor scripting of Draco.\n\nThe adult cast were excellent. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were perfectly cast. Lupin was soft yet stern when needed and you could feel there was a parental rapport between him and Harry, and I couldn't imagine anyone other than David Thewlis in the role. And Gary Oldman was great in depicting Black's determination, mingled with an hysterical madness due to his incarceration in the hellish wizarding prison Azkaban. As for Michael Gambon, who was recast in the role of Dumbledore, I felt he was an improvement. Richard Harris was a gifted actor but his Dumbledore had a cold, aloofness to him whereas Gambon was able to portray the warm, eccentricity of the character without diminishing the power and wisdom of Dumbledore. And the rest of the regular cast, such as Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith, were perfect although we expect no better from them now!\n\nOne of the best aspects of this film is how it no longer pandered to kiddies like the previous two films did. There was a darker, moodier edge to the story and the characters. The wizarding world no longer seemed like a perfect haven and the characters had grown beyond being innocent children; this reflected the book itself since many feel PoA was a turning point in the series where it finally felt like Harry Potter- boy and book- were growing up. The Hogwarts' setting differed from the previous films yet not only was it definitely more faithful to the books but finally it felt as if the castle was in Scotland rather than perpetually sunny Disney Land and this enhanced the mood being set in the film. The clock was a nice touch, linking to the theme of time in the actual storyline, as was the bridge in being a place for Harry to mull over his problems. Also, in many ways, this film could have ended up a muddled mess in regards to the ending but Cuaron handled the Time Turner scenes well.\n\nHowever, there were flaws to the film, which let it down. The characters of Hermione and Draco were poorly scripted so they seemed like two completely different characters from the ones we know and love in the books. Although Watson as an actress has improved since CoS, the main problem with the script is that Hermione is being portrayed as being too cool and cocky compared to the bookworm who has no interest in fashion that we know Hermione to be in the books. Steve Kloves, the scriptwriter who admits he's responsible for the change, really needs to learn heroines don't need to be cool Buffy types to be admired; part of why Hermione is so popular as a character in the books is that she appeals to girls who are bookish themselves and easily identify with her. And as for Draco, he comes across as too much of a cowardly, weak girlie-boy rather than an insidious, vicious brat who can be a threat to Harry when he chooses to. \n\nAlso, there was no telling of what Black did to Snape in school that left him so bitter in his hatred and I wished they'd included the scene where he let slip what Lupin was, especially as this animosity between him, Black and Lupin plays a larger role as the books go on. And speaking of Lupin, the werewolf CGI was atrocious. He looked like an emaciated rat rather than the wolf-like creature who leaves even the more powerful wizards quivering in fear. I wished there was more in the ending too as I would have loved to see Vernon's face when he found out who Black was. Kloves needs to learn how to round the Harry Potter films off properly as this was also a sticking point in CoS.\n\nAt the end of the day, there were scenes left out, some of which we didn't mind skipping but others (an explanation to Harry of James Potter's friendship to Black and Lupin) were sorely missed. It was a great film but it could have done with being made longer or skipping on non-essential scenes (less of the Knight Bus and Hermione punching Malfoy in a manner that makes her out to be a thug) to make way for scenes which are more important. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting something along the lines of RotK but it's still great viewing. I'd give it a seven-and-a-half out of ten with the hopes Cuaron will return to the helm again although preferably not with Kloves as the scriptwriter. I think Cuaron would be excellent working with a script produced by someone who has a better handle on the darker aspects of the books and a deeper understanding of the HP characters.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":585447,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-06-03","keywords":"magic,wizard,werewolf,rat,school of magic","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007761177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

I wished there was more in the ending too as I would have loved to see Vernon's face when he found out who Black was. Kloves needs to learn how to round the Harry Potter films off properly as this was also a sticking point in CoS.\n\nAt the end of the day, there were scenes left out, some of which we didn't mind skipping but others (an explanation to Harry of James Potter's friendship to Black and Lupin) were sorely missed. It was a great film but it could have done with being made longer or skipping on non-essential scenes (less of the Knight Bus and Hermione punching Malfoy in a manner that makes her out to be a thug) to make way for scenes which are more important. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting something along the lines of RotK but it's still great viewing. I'd give it a seven-and-a-half out of ten with the hopes Cuaron will return to the helm again although preferably not with Kloves as the scriptwriter. I think Cuaron would be excellent working with a script produced by someone who has a better handle on the darker aspects of the books and a deeper understanding of the HP characters.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":585447,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-06-03","keywords":"magic,wizard,werewolf,rat,school of magic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007761177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

If you know him from "Breaking Bad" you will surprised by his depth here. See him, at least.

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before.

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot.

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"],"duration":"PT2H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The L Word is back and it's not bad at all!","reviewBody":"The L Word changed my life. I was a very confused 14 year Colombian girl living in a very small city with my very Catholic family. I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show. Just don't watch it if you don't like it but you can't say it's not a great deal for our community and for us, lesbians.\n\nLesbian, from Lesbos. The origin of the L word is beautiful. Read about Sappho, read her poems. We should be proud of it and we should celebrate it.\n\nWe need more shows like this. Visibility is our best allied, don't forget that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5372,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-08","keywords":"lesbian","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000884/","name":"Jennifer Beals"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0595485/","name":"Katherine Moennig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0354157/","name":"Leisha Hailey"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0886561/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052980/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271093/","name":"Michele Abbott"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149669/","name":"Ilene Chaiken"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271884/","name":"Kathy Greenberg"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3625959449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmYzNGQzZjQtZGYxOS00OTRiLTg2ZDEtYzhhMmQzYzU5NjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmYzNGQzZjQtZGYxOS00OTRiLTg2ZDEtYzhhMmQzYzU5NjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Season 2 is available to stream August 6, 2021 on SHOWTIME."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy.

As a result, the impact of the film was somewhat lost on me. I was expecting an action film instead of a character drama with lots of police procedure. But now, older and wiser and with a brand new Blu Ray of the movie, I am finally able to appreciate how clever the film is.\n\nThe story unfortunately IS riddled with 80s Cop Movie clichés and goes through quite a lot of familiar motions. But if you see past that you'll appreciate the immense atmosphere and mood that Ridley Scott piles on. Simply put, Michael Douglas is Nick Conklin, a bad cop (pretty much the exact same character in Basic Instinct) who drag races on his superbike to pay alimony and pinches drug money instead of turning it in for evidence. Enjoying lunch with partner Charlie (Andy Garcia) in a steakhouse in New York's meat-packing district, they just happen to witness a Yakuza execution by wanted Japanese criminal Sato (Yusaku Matsuda, who was dying of cancer during filming and didn't tell anyone). After a quick punch-up and shoot-out they find themselves chaperoning Sato back to Osaka. But when they arrive there he manages to escape, leaving them embarrassed with lots of questions to answer.\n\nNick and Charlie find themselves in a very foreign and intolerant world and recapturing Sato proves to be difficult in many ways. Not the least of which is Japan's alienating culture (from an NYPD point of view) and rigid rules. Nonetheless, Nick is determined to catch Sato and restore his honor.\n\nLike I said, the atmosphere of the film is overwhelming, which is really all the film needs. The clichés and stereotypes don't matter so much when you are involved this much. Hans Zimmer (his first film with Ridley Scott) provides a deeply emotional and very melodic score that'll be rattling around in your head for days. It's a shame it's never had a comprehensive CD release, as it's one of Zimmer's most impressive efforts.\n\nYou could call it a pretty 80s movies, but I still do feel that it holds up pretty well today. As one of Ridley Scott's more forgotten works, it's well worth checking out.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52384,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1989-09-22","keywords":"japan,yakuza,police chase,osaka japan,counterfeit","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000412/","name":"Andy Garcia"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0847264/","name":"Ken Takakura"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035763/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015234/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093271/","name":"Craig Bolotin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0507863/","name":"Warren Lewis"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Simply put, Michael Douglas is Nick Conklin, a bad cop (pretty much the exact same character in Basic Instinct) who drag races on his superbike to pay alimony and pinches drug money instead of turning it in for evidence. Enjoying lunch with partner Charlie (Andy Garcia) in a steakhouse in New York's meat-packing district, they just happen to witness a Yakuza execution by wanted Japanese criminal Sato (Yusaku Matsuda, who was dying of cancer during filming and didn't tell anyone). After a quick punch-up and shoot-out they find themselves chaperoning Sato back to Osaka. But when they arrive there he manages to escape, leaving them embarrassed with lots of questions to answer.\n\nNick and Charlie find themselves in a very foreign and intolerant world and recapturing Sato proves to be difficult in many ways. Not the least of which is Japan's alienating culture (from an NYPD point of view) and rigid rules. Nonetheless, Nick is determined to catch Sato and restore his honor.\n\nLike I said, the atmosphere of the film is overwhelming, which is really all the film needs. The clichés and stereotypes don't matter so much when you are involved this much. Hans Zimmer (his first film with Ridley Scott) provides a deeply emotional and very melodic score that'll be rattling around in your head for days. It's a shame it's never had a comprehensive CD release, as it's one of Zimmer's most impressive efforts.\n\nYou could call it a pretty 80s movies, but I still do feel that it holds up pretty well today. As one of Ridley Scott's more forgotten works, it's well worth checking out.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52384,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1989-09-22","keywords":"japan,yakuza,police chase,osaka japan,counterfeit","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000140/","name":"Michael Douglas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000412/","name":"Andy Garcia","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0847264/","name":"Ken Takakura"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035763/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015234/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093271/","name":"Craig Bolotin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0507863/","name":"Warren Lewis"],"duration":"PT2H5M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

So he decides to accept his bosses challenge; bring an 'idiot' to their annual 'Dinner for Winners'. A competition run by white-collar executives and disguised as a celebration of brilliance in unrecognised individuals. In reality, the meal is simply an opportunity for elitist senior-management types to laugh at some quirky and eccentric members of society. Tim's girlfriend tries to convince him the whole idea is abhorrent. Just as he is beginning to agree with her, he meets Barry (Steve Carell). An IRS worker, with a passion for creating art from taxidermied mice, Barry might just be the perfect man to help Tim win the competition.\n\nThe US version of The Office has shown us that Carell can do awkward better than most and Anchorman proved his capabilities of making stupidity funny. However, his character here is completely unlikeable and, more often than not, irritating. His bowl haircut, glasses and protruding teeth, evoke bad seventies sitcoms. A time when this look would have been a stylists shorthand for 'socially inept'. Paul Rudd, on the other hand, is given little opportunity to make us laugh, playing two-dimensional straight man, Tim. Director Jay Roach's previous franchises (Austin Powers, Meet the Parents/Fockers) may not have been the greatest comedies of the past fifteen years, but delivered as and when expected. The problems with Dinner for Schmucks lie in the pacing and the writing. With a 114 minute runtime, it is simply too long. Entire characters and subplots are superfluous. It also suffers badly from second-act-drag, believing that given enough on-screen time we will somehow empathise with our two leads.\n\nProducer Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat, Bruno), seems to have called in a number of favours from celebrity friends and cast them in every available role. The idea, presumably, is that good performances can boost a weak script into something amusing. Of Course, this is not the case. Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) as avant-garde artiste, Kieran, makes the most of his characters nonsequiturs but only manages to raise a smirk at best. The same cannot be said for David Walliams (Little Britain), whose Swiss, aristocratic character, Mueller, is completely redundant in every way. The only worthy gag in almost two-hours is provided by Chris O' Dowd (The I.T. Crowd) as a blind swordsman. However having only a handful of lines and appearing twenty minutes before the credits roll, its far too little, far too late.\n\nDinner for Schmucks starts with a premise full of comedic opportunities, but spends the next hour and a half ignoring these. The original, a French film from 1998 entitled The Dinner Game, was a social satire focusing on the ridiculous measures the aristocracy will go to amuse themselves. It was full of witty dialogue and, at 80 minutes long, it worked. As often happens, Hollywood seems to have missed the point and delivered a broad and bland remake."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104355,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-13","keywords":"smashing a bottle against a wall,wine,hairy chested male,man wears eyeglasses,remake","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dinner for Schmucks: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3797747481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who "succeeds" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called "dinner for idiots," which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210895/","name":"Stephanie Szostak"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

So he decides to accept his bosses challenge; bring an 'idiot' to their annual 'Dinner for Winners'. A competition run by white-collar executives and disguised as a celebration of brilliance in unrecognised individuals. In reality, the meal is simply an opportunity for elitist senior-management types to laugh at some quirky and eccentric members of society. Tim's girlfriend tries to convince him the whole idea is abhorrent. Just as he is beginning to agree with her, he meets Barry (Steve Carell). An IRS worker, with a passion for creating art from taxidermied mice, Barry might just be the perfect man to help Tim win the competition.\n\nThe US version of The Office has shown us that Carell can do awkward better than most and Anchorman proved his capabilities of making stupidity funny. However, his character here is completely unlikeable and, more often than not, irritating. His bowl haircut, glasses and protruding teeth, evoke bad seventies sitcoms. A time when this look would have been a stylists shorthand for 'socially inept'. Paul Rudd, on the other hand, is given little opportunity to make us laugh, playing two-dimensional straight man, Tim. Director Jay Roach's previous franchises (Austin Powers, Meet the Parents/Fockers) may not have been the greatest comedies of the past fifteen years, but delivered as and when expected. The problems with Dinner for Schmucks lie in the pacing and the writing. With a 114 minute runtime, it is simply too long. Entire characters and subplots are superfluous. It also suffers badly from second-act-drag, believing that given enough on-screen time we will somehow empathise with our two leads.\n\nProducer Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat, Bruno), seems to have called in a number of favours from celebrity friends and cast them in every available role. The idea, presumably, is that good performances can boost a weak script into something amusing. Of Course, this is not the case. Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) as avant-garde artiste, Kieran, makes the most of his characters nonsequiturs but only manages to raise a smirk at best. The same cannot be said for David Walliams (Little Britain), whose Swiss, aristocratic character, Mueller, is completely redundant in every way. The only worthy gag in almost two-hours is provided by Chris O' Dowd (The I.T. Crowd) as a blind swordsman. However having only a handful of lines and appearing twenty minutes before the credits roll, its far too little, far too late.\n\nDinner for Schmucks starts with a premise full of comedic opportunities, but spends the next hour and a half ignoring these. The original, a French film from 1998 entitled The Dinner Game, was a social satire focusing on the ridiculous measures the aristocracy will go to amuse themselves. It was full of witty dialogue and, at 80 minutes long, it worked. As often happens, Hollywood seems to have missed the point and delivered a broad and bland remake.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104355,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-13","keywords":"smashing a bottle against a wall,wine,hairy chested male,man wears eyeglasses,remake","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dinner for Schmucks: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3797747481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who "succeeds" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called "dinner for idiots," which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210895/","name":"Stephanie Szostak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Let me just get that out of the way. But he isn't perfect. Take for example the song, "Live and Let Die", a song he wrote in the '70s for a Bond movie of the same name.

"In which we live in"? Was he kidding? A great talent, but that is some lazy songwriting. I figure he was either exhausted, or under contract, as opposed to being inspired.\n\nAnd that's the problem with this entire movie. The writing is simply not up to par. The story is loaded down with so many different elements that it is impossible to develop any of them. You can almost see the writers thinking, "Okay, now we've got a bunch of stuff for Shrek, Donkey, and Puss to do. Let's put in some stuff for Fiona and Lillian here..." The result is that there's a script, but no real story. And the dialog with some exceptions, is full of the clichés they so happily lampooned in earlier Shreks.

I guess the franchise is so important now that it must be handled by two directors, neither of whom has Adamson's knack for timing.

One side part of his life is stealing valuable works of art.  In an elaborate set-up, Crown manages to steal a painting from a New York gallery without detection.  However insurance investigator Catherine Banning suspects him and pursues him.  Crown falls for her, realising the fun he can have with a worthy adversary.  However as their relationship becomes more serious, Catherine also begins to close the web on Crown  but which way will she go with him?\n\nI ignored this in the cinema due to fairly average reviews and likewise video didn't entice me.  However free on terrestrial  yeah, I'll take that! So I settled down to something that immediately set itself out to be fresh, slick and light with a jazzy credit sequence and a glossy (without being OTT) little robbery sequence.  So far so good.  The middle section is not quite all it could have been but it is still good.  It does get a little heavy and slows the film down and the romance between the two leads doesn't quite wash at every turn, but they toy with each other well enough to keep the interest.\n\nThe climax is pretty cool and clever and it is refreshing that the film never falls into big action set pieces to win over the audience  instead keeping it glossy and slick throughout. It is quite something to find a thriller of sorts that is for grown ups and not teenage boys who NEED something to blow up every so often.  The plot here is robust enough to meet the film's needs but is a little too slick to be examined too closely.  But take this as what it is  slick adult popcorn seller  and you'll enjoy it. It is breezy and enjoyable.\n\nAs Crown, Brosnan exudes charm and smoothness but also is able to put an edge on it to show that Crown is not happy even when he has the world. Russo gives a better performance than I've come to expect from her but is still a little out of place in the film.  She isn't totally convincing and I became annoyed by the regular appearance of her tits in the film  did it really help the film I wondered?  Maybe once it was natural in the scene but the rest just seems like a cry for an audience.  Leary does sterling work as Det McCann, although he isn't funny he is a strong serious actor and carries the role well.  The support cast are all pretty good and Dunaway's cameo adds to the slick feeling rather than standing out awkwardly.\n\nOverall this film will please you if you know what to expect.  If you want something wonderful or meaningful then this will let you down.  However, if you're ready for a slick, glossy bit of entertainment that will engage without challenging then this should be more than enough to pass a wet Saturday afternoon."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":90475,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Romance","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1999-11-03","keywords":"sex in bed,sexual desire,female rear nudity,female frontal nudity,lust","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Thomas Crown Affair","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1084556569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA0MTZjMzItOTVmZi00OGRkLThjM2EtYjhjYWE0MDBhMjQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDA0MTZjMzItOTVmZi00OGRkLThjM2EtYjhjYWE0MDBhMjQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000623/","name":"Rene Russo"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001459/","name":"Denis Leary"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001532/","name":"John McTiernan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088199/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874450/","name":"Alan Trustman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0228908/","name":"Leslie Dixon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After the events at Lake Victoria, the pre-historic school of blood-thirsty piranhas make their way into a newly opened waterpark.\n\nYou know, when you're about to watch this kind of movie that you don't have to expect too much and just enjoy the ride. The first 'Piranha'-remake kinda accomplished that. This one started okay - a scene where Gary Busey is looking for his lost cow in the water, turns into an unexpected funny gag. But after we know in which direction this film is taking us - an 'Adults only'-pool with water certified strippers - and the awful acting of several supporting cast members, I knew this wasn't gonna be the good-kinda-bad. \n\nSadly "Piranha 3DD" is more boring than its predecessor and could've been more, if you look at the original 'Piranha' sequel (directed by James Cameron himself). This one just lacks originality.  The director has no idea how to handle this and you can tell in the second half of this film. It's not a comedy nor a self-parody or horror.\n\n"Welcome to rock bottom!"","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41556,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2012-07-14","keywords":"piranha,bare breasts,blonde,water park,bikini","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1902617369","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODE5ODU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1MTM3Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODE5ODU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1MTM3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After the events at Lake Victoria, the pre-historic school of blood-thirsty piranhas make their way into a newly opened waterpark.

After the events at Lake Victoria, the pre-historic school of blood-thirsty piranhas make their way into a newly opened waterpark.\n\nYou know, when you're about to watch this kind of movie that you don't have to expect too much and just enjoy the ride. The first 'Piranha'-remake kinda accomplished that. This one started okay - a scene where Gary Busey is looking for his lost cow in the water, turns into an unexpected funny gag. But after we know in which direction this film is taking us - an 'Adults only'-pool with water certified strippers - and the awful acting of several supporting cast members, I knew this wasn't gonna be the good-kinda-bad. \n\nSadly "Piranha 3DD" is more boring than its predecessor and could've been more, if you look at the original 'Piranha' sequel (directed by James Cameron himself). This one just lacks originality.  The director has no idea how to handle this and you can tell in the second half of this film. It's not a comedy nor a self-parody or horror.\n\n"Welcome to rock bottom!"","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41556,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2012-07-14","keywords":"piranha,bare breasts,blonde,water park,bikini","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1902617369","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODE5ODU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1MTM3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODE5ODU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1MTM3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After the events at Lake Victoria, the pre-historic school of blood-thirsty piranhas make their way into a newly opened waterpark.

Bee Movie stands as a decent effort that slowly tries to entice us into its colorful animated world. The story deals with a recently graduated bee named Barry (voiced by Jerry Seinfeld) that begins to feel that there's more to life than working his butt off just to fabricate honey. So he decides to train with the Pollen Jocks whose job is to collect pollen from flowers outside the hive. That's how he gets out to the real world, and after a series of jiggling and accidental events, he is saved by Vanessa (voiced by Renée Zellweger) just as her boyfriend was about to squash him. Barry breaks an extremely important rule of bees: never speak to humans. But he does so knowingly just to thank Vanessa for saving his life. After they get to know each other, Barry finds out and immediately reacts outrageously to the fact that humans eat the very same honey that all the bees in the world work exhaustingly to make, just for the humans to make a profit out of it. This leads to a series of events that result in a catastrophic environmental outcome and it becomes Barry's mission to put it back the way it ought to be.\n\nI'm a big Seinfeld fan, but I gotta say, hearing Jerry's voice coming from an animated bee is something of a bizarre experience, as I didn't think his voice really fit the character, and this off-putting perception made the viewing experience a bit distracting. Seinfeld's voice holds a mature, adult sounding quality to it that it seems inadequate for a young bee fresh out of school. Apart from that, there were some clever jokes and bits like the appearance of Ray Liotta to name one and some obvious ones that should have gone unnoticed for their own sake. Overall I think that is an enjoyable way to spend an hour and a half; just immerse youself in the story and try to relate to it, for I'm sure that one of us has felt the way Barry does: unsure about what the future holds concerning job prospects, and worried that it might be the same life day in day out for the rest of your repeated days.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":152397,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2007-12-12","keywords":"jazz,larry king character,honey,surrealism,exploitation","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bee Movie","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi347210009","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MjY3MTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM4NDQ4._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY2MjY3MTA4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMzM4NDQ4._V1_.jpg","description":"Bee Movie Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000632/","name":"Jerry Seinfeld"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000250/","name":"Renée Zellweger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000111/","name":"Matthew Broderick"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0971239/","name":"Simon J.

The audacity of what he was attempting, spoofing the industry that was giving him the money to do so, blatantly and lovingly, was too great to ignore. And then there is the cast of stars with cameo after cameo of surprise faces joining in on the fun, not to mention the intense marketing strategy pushing it along. Websites for each fictional actor, a site with clips from the Rain of Madness making of documentary (a Heart of Darkness send up "directed" by co-writer Justin Theroux), and even a faux E! True Hollywood Story to air the week before its premiere in theatres just add to the mythology and attention to detail that went into its making. Now, having finally seen the end result, I must say it didn't let me down. True, I was expecting more in the way of story and plot, especially with all that background info manufactured, but when you get down to it, the entertainment value is off the charts, the one-liners are going to be quoted for years to come, and the laughs come often and hard.\n\nTo take on subject matter as lofty as a send-up to war films, mainly Apocalypse Now, needs a certain amount to bravery and confidence to not care if it all backfires. The production value and effects make this seem as though it is a certified blockbuster falling apart at the seams. Sure the characters are funny and the events on display hilarious, but by the look and feel of the aesthetic, this is a war film to the end. Between that realism and the love I have for meta-narrative, there was little chance Stiller would be bombing in my eyes. Something about movies within movies intrigue the heck out of me, and this one having actors within actors just played up my interest more. There was truly no better way to start this movie then how was done: the playing of Alpa Chino's rap music, consumerism selling commercial and trailers for our three leads' previous films. What better way to be introduced to our action star, our funnyman, and our award winning thespian? Knowing full well the extent of satire going on, each spot delivers, giving a little background into the work these men have done in the past.\n\nDirectly connecting with the subsequent shot, a live scene from the film at hand, the egos finally come out and show face. Jack Black's Jeff Portney reins in his comedian schtick to portray a hardened solider, voice rasping as he shows his serious side; Stiller's Tugg Speedman attempts to revive the action cred he tried to leave behind with his Oscar-bait turn as a mentally handicapped man in Simple Jack, where he went "full retarded, no one ever comes back from that"; and Robert Downey Jr.'s Kirk Lazarus, Australian genius at his craft, playing a black man like he was born one. The scene continues without a hitch, explosions everywhere, screams heard in the distance, and a heartfelt death about to be delivered, until the men show their true colors. Tugg can't make himself cry, (he's just not that good), and Kirk's blubbering and drooling is just so real that the two must partake in a pissing match while effects guru Cody, (the red hot of late Danny McBride), let's loose the one-take only scorched earth fire storm. It's all falling apart and script-writer/former soldier Four Leaf, (the always gruff Nick Nolte), gets the director, (Steve Coogan with one of the best film exits I've ever seen), to agree on guerilla filming, deep in the jungle of foreign lands. Here is where the fun begins and where the movie inside the movie becomes real, or, in effect, the actual moviekind of like "the dude playing the dude, disguised as another dude". The levels at play here are just too many to mention.\n\nBesides a weakly written role for Black, the rest of the men are given enough to work with for some truly great moments. Stiller has a few instances where he returns to his over-long annoying routinepouring "fake" blood into his mouth for onebut for the most part did a real good job, especially with his tough guy poses shooting off his gun. Jay Baruchel shines as the only non-celebrity involved, the guy who went to boot camp, read the novel and the script, and idolizes the men he is working with. Good to see him get a more beefed up role as opposed to the side parts in Apatow films. And the back and forth between Downey Jr. and Brandon T. Jackson's Alpa never get old. The whole dynamic of real black man versus fake was unceasingly funny.\n\nThere were plot points that irked me throughout, TiVo's cameo being the biggest culprit, but I found myself pushing the problems aside and just enjoying the ride. Downey Jr.'s facial expressions, voices, and presence may steal the show, but what really allowed me to forget my worries was an absolutely brilliant cameo from Tom Cruise. His studio executive, pompously crass, loud-mouth made me think of all the horror stories you hear about the Weinsteins, and his dance moves can not be equaled. Tropic Thunder is first and foremost a vehicle for a bunch of friends to have a blast poking fun at their craft and really at themselves. I'll be remembering quotes all night now, thinking that while the story itself doesn't necessitate me watching it again soon, the jokes just might make buying it a must not to mention the wealth of extras that DVD is sure to have.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":396847,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","War"],"datePublished":"2008-08-20","keywords":"film within a film,parody,vietnam,helicopter crash,fake trailer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Tropic Thunder","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2139141657","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3OTk1MzYzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU2NDkxMDI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3OTk1MzYzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjU2NDkxMDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Tropic"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085312/","name":"Jack Black"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000375/","name":"Robert Downey Jr."}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0039303/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0245613/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0857620/","name":"Justin Theroux"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1000113/","name":"Etan Cohen"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Day after day, night after night he takes the 2 am train to hell, where unsuspecting passengers are massacred and then hung up like dead meat.\n\nLeon (Bradley Cooper) is an up and coming photograph, who is trying to make it critically, but so far his work has been unable to break it. His biggest fan and believer is his beautiful fiancée Maya (Leslie Bibb). One chance session in the subway changes the direction of his life. First he photographs a model being harassed by some thugs and after saving her from them takes a picture of her entering the 2 am train...\n\nClive Barker has really been prolific with all the horror he has caused come to life on the big screen. It is enough to mention that his stories was the backbone of such classics as Hellraiser or Candyman. That said he has also been raped as a horror writer with atrocities such as Rawhead Rex.\n\nThis movie doesn't hit the highs or the lows, but I must say it was pretty decent and definitely one of the best genre movies I have seen lately. No matter has essentially idiotic the plot I have to say it did cut loose of the copycat phase in horror cinema we are currently at. It had a certain freshness to it not only in the way it was told, but also in subject matter itself. I won't go as far as to say it was breakthrough original, but it was darn intriguing all the way through.\n\nI normally rate a good horror movie based on gut feeling. The moment you can't wait to know what will happen at the end of the movie or in the next scene for that matter and at the same time you have to fight with yourself to continue watching - that lets you know this horror flick is actually pretty good.\n\nDefinitely full of flaws and the graphic gore isn't my kind of horror meal. Acting was great and tech credits all round were superb. Ryûhei Kitamura deserves accolades for this horror movie. Maybe not a classic, but given the far fetched material he had to work with it is a triumph.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":63002,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Horror"],"datePublished":"2008-10-31","keywords":"photographer,subway,butcher,dismemberment,art gallery","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Midnight Meat Train","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2259812633","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMjczNjY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcyNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMjczNjY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcyNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Midnight Meat Train - Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005068/","name":"Vinnie Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004753/","name":"Leslie Bibb"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457565/","name":"Ryûhei Kitamura"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165062/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1161528/","name":"Jeff Buhler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000850/","name":"Clive Barker"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This show DOES NOT try to prove or disprove the paranormal. Nor are the stories even slightly realistic. When you realize that, you will appreciate the show much more. I really don't like the 2-story episodes of season 1. Season 2 is a lot better. Season 2 is all-around stronger, better, and scarier. There are plenty of jump scenes and loads of suspense. This is probably the best "Haunted Documentary" style show on TV. Some episodes are just pure junk, but the "Man in the Attic," "Capitol Theater Haunting," and "The Dybbuk Box" are by far the freakiest and most jumpy episodes.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2595,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"genre":["Documentary","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2011-09-07","keywords":"haunting,poltergeist,two word title,eyewitness account,documentary series","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7025791/","name":"Gillian English"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3266807/","name":"Frances Townend"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3141457/","name":"Daniel Cannis"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0178419/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Paranormal Witness","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3941252377","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVkMWY4N2YtM2Y2Zi00OGRiLTkwNDUtOWIxZWM4ZDdkMGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNGVkMWY4N2YtM2Y2Zi00OGRiLTkwNDUtOWIxZWM4ZDdkMGY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Paranormal Witness"}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>
