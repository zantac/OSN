I, as well as millions of others film-freaks, awaited Uma Thurman's further adventures with wicked anticipation. And of course Tarantino didn't disappoint. Volume two is a completely different movie than volume one, but it's equally brilliant and the director's trademarks are shown more than obviously. Volume one merely was homage to the Eastern Martial Arts movies, with delightfully over-the-top splatter and gore while Vol. 2 fully focuses on ancient westerns and rural horror. There's more dialogue, more twists n turns and the anti-chronological structure results in more depth and involvement. Some unexplained elements from Vol.1 become clear now and even the entire background of Thurman's character gets unveiled. For the very first time, (as far as I can remember) Tarantino really knows how to create an unbearable tension! There's a sequence in which Uma is buried alive and trapped under the ground Through simple methods, like a completely black screen, Tarantino arises claustrophobia among the audience! Truly terrific filmmaking. \n\nThe actors in Kill Bill aren't Hollywood's best, but they each have their charisma and their typical Tarantino characters do the rest.

I, as well as millions of others film-freaks, awaited Uma Thurman's further adventures with wicked anticipation. And of course Tarantino didn't disappoint. Volume two is a completely different movie than volume one, but it's equally brilliant and the director's trademarks are shown more than obviously. Volume one merely was homage to the Eastern Martial Arts movies, with delightfully over-the-top splatter and gore while Vol. 2 fully focuses on ancient westerns and rural horror. There's more dialogue, more twists n turns and the anti-chronological structure results in more depth and involvement. Some unexplained elements from Vol.1 become clear now and even the entire background of Thurman's character gets unveiled. For the very first time, (as far as I can remember) Tarantino really knows how to create an unbearable tension! There's a sequence in which Uma is buried alive and trapped under the ground Through simple methods, like a completely black screen, Tarantino arises claustrophobia among the audience! Truly terrific filmmaking. \n\nThe actors in Kill Bill aren't Hollywood's best, but they each have their charisma and their typical Tarantino characters do the rest. The camera viewpoints are brilliant at times and  as usual  the tiny absurd elements are a joy to discover. Tarantino's entire Kill Bill achievement may easily be considered as one of the most creative and dared film-projects ever! Do yourself a favor and watch them!

The mysteries themselves are self-contained from episode to episode, while character development story arcs take place in the background to tie things together. As other reviewers have noted, the writers have made hero Sidney Chambers remarkably liberal and modern in his views. Perhaps in 1953 there were small-town vicars with such attitudes, but after a while it feels unrealistic. \n\nFor whatever reason, season 3 fell flat for me, to the extent I thought they might have changed writers. Perhaps it's the peaking of a couple of those story arcs in season 2, but I found that I no longer cared very much about the characters, while the mysteries began to feel secondary to the characters' stories. I'm unlikely to come back for season 4.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":12199,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2014-10-06","keywords":"1950s,england,amateur detective,priest,vicar","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338292/","name":"Robson Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668854/","name":"Tessa Peake-Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1632403/","name":"Al Weaver"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0307870/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271538/","name":"Daisy Coulam"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 4 Preview","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2382740505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxY2U4NjAtMTFmMy00NDk5LTgyMWEtOTc0ZDg1MGFmODRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxY2U4NjAtMTFmMy00NDk5LTgyMWEtOTc0ZDg1MGFmODRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Cambridgeshire clergyman finds himself investigating a series of mysterious wrongdoings in his small village of Grantchester."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

 --- Description: I Am Burt Reynolds: Directed by Adrian Buitenhuis. With Adam Rifkin, Alfie Wise, Ann Scurry, Ariel Winter. Burt Reynolds was the epitome of American macho. Known for his charm, his iconic mustache and penchant for women and cars. His career includes more than 200 films and TV series, a nude photo on a bearskin in Cosmopolitan, but also a fight against drug addiction due to stunt injuries. Through rarely viewed archive material and interviews with his family, friends and colleagues, an intimate portrait of one of America's most beloved stars is drawn." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt13721940/","name":"I Am Burt Reynolds","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTIyMzVmMDctNjJlMy00NjNmLWE1M2ItYjI2NDcwZmUxZTBkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEyODk3NTgz._V1_.jpg","description":"Burt Reynolds was the epitome of American macho.

The documentary is largely based on Reynhold's career, but also deals with his private life. The film's strength is good analyzes of his achievements on the screen made by close friends and colleagues in the industry. Jon Voight and Bruce Dern's participation in the film in particular gives the documentary weight as they were both close friends and colleagues of Burt. The documentary also has clips from highlights of his career, as a reminder of how good he was. Burt Reynholds was a superstar, and the documentary shows well why he became so popular and loved by many.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":177,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"genre":["Documentary","Biography"],"datePublished":"2020-12-17","keywords":"reference to burt reynolds,film star,actor,hollywood star,southerner","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0726472/","name":"Adam Rifkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936304/","name":"Alfie Wise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12182676/","name":"Ann Scurry"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2366871/","name":"Adrian Buitenhuis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0195799/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0190365/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2366871/","name":"Adrian Buitenhuis"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Part of the issue, I think, is that even though they are dynamic, charismatica and GOOD LOOKING screen presences that embody the very definitioni of the term "MOVIE STAR", they are working in a language that is not their native language, so something, I think, gets lost in translation. So, it was with some excitement that I checked out the Spanish language thriller EVERYBODY KNOWS (Spanish Title: TODOS LO SOBEN).\n\nAnd...I wasn't disappointed. Both Bardem and (especially) Cruz shine in this familial thriller. Cruz stars as Laura, a native of Spain now living in Argentina. She (and her 2 children) come back to her small village outside of Madrid for the wedding of her younger sister. When a bad thing happens on this trip, Laura must find a way out while dealing with lingering family matters and pressures that come to the fore due to the stress of the situation.\n\nWithout putting too much of a fine point on this, Cruz is stunning. Not only is she a beautiful woman who commands the screen whenever she is on, but as her character becomes more and more physically and emotionally torn with "the situation" her raw emotions come out and you see a very real portrayal of a mother who will do anything for her children. This performance is (was?) Academy Award worthy - it is that good. This is a strong actress at the top of her game.\n\nShe is more than matched on screen by the less showey, nuanced - yet fun, at times - performance of her real life husband, Javier Bardem, who plays a person from Lara's past that is drawn into the events. Bardem won an Oscar for playing the mysterious, scary hitman, Anton Chigurh in NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MAN. This was a a character who barely spoke. In this film, he plays a lively, extroverted fun-loving person who's whole personae is called into question, quite the contrast to the English language characters I have, heretofore, known him for.\n\nIranian Director Asghar Farhadi (best known for THE SEPARATION) does a good job driving the story - once it gets started - he is sure handed in handling both the suspense/action moments of this movie as well as the family drama during the "many people talking around a table" scenes. This film led off the Cannes Film Festival last year and was greatly lauded.\n\nIt's not a perfect film. My friend who saw the movie with me stated (correctly) that he had never seen a movie that "started so poorly but corrected itself and finished as an excellent film" like this one did. The first 1/2 hour to 45 minutes of this 2 hour and 15 minute film is filled with introducing the myriad of characters associated with this family (and the mystery that enfolds), but it is a scattershot approach to film making and character introduction and Farhadi misses the mark more than he hits the mark during this period.\n\nBut once the mystery unfolds - and Cruz and Bardem's characters (and acting) kicks into high gear - things get quite good, quite tense and quite engrossing. Well worth the time to check it out.\n\nLetter Grade B+: (C for the first 45 minutes, A for the last hour and a half)\n\n7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32812,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2018-05-09","keywords":"kidnapping,tied feet,bell tower,pigeon,bell","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3856710169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJjZjQ2NTgtZWM3YS00OGQyLWExYmEtYzlmZTI0M2UxN2M1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJjZjQ2NTgtZWM3YS00OGQyLWExYmEtYzlmZTI0M2UxN2M1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Laura, a Spanish woman living in Buenos Aires, returns to her hometown outside Madrid with her two children to attend her sister's wedding.

Well worth the time to check it out.\n\nLetter Grade B+: (C for the first 45 minutes, A for the last hour and a half)\n\n7 1/2 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32812,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2018-05-09","keywords":"kidnapping,tied feet,bell tower,pigeon,bell","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3856710169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJjZjQ2NTgtZWM3YS00OGQyLWExYmEtYzlmZTI0M2UxN2M1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWJjZjQ2NTgtZWM3YS00OGQyLWExYmEtYzlmZTI0M2UxN2M1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Laura, a Spanish woman living in Buenos Aires, returns to her hometown outside Madrid with her two children to attend her sister's wedding.

It's a yearly series of four 90-minute movies that loosely tie up together, especially in the character of Vera Stanhope, a driven and crotchety character who excels in her work but who has trouble connecting to the people around her or in dealing with her past life.\n\nBrenda Blethyn is just perfect as the middle-aged copper and just as changeable as the North England weather. She's just as likely to lash out at her colleagues as she is the suspects in the series of murders she must solve.\n\nChief among the supporting cast are David Leon as Vera's sergeant Joe Ashworth, later replaced by Kenny Doughty as Aiden Healy. There's also Jon Morrison as Kenny Lockhart and Riley Jones as Mark Edwards. In the first couple of seasons, Peter Ritter as the weirdly comic pathologist Billy Cartwright is a delight. But there are plenty of other quirky coppers and suspects lurking about the Yorkshire dale and towns. The location shooting is quite stunning as well.\n\nThe mysteries are based on characters created by Ann Cleeves and most of them are excellent. It's never easy to guess the killer. You won't see a parade of famous actors but that works in the show's favor.\n\nA great show for mystery fans and those who like great acting.\n\nAnd how is it possible that this great show has never gotten a single BAFTA nomination?","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11750,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"TV-PG","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2011-05-01","keywords":"forename as series title,character name as series title,one word series title,northumberland,murder mystery","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000950/","name":"Brenda Blethyn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0607201/","name":"Jon Morrison","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4474370/","name":"Riley Jones"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0269801/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 11 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4253991705","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGNmZGI0NGQtN2Q1ZC00NWRlLWFkN2UtNmJmNzFkZWExNjA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGNmZGI0NGQtN2Q1ZC00NWRlLWFkN2UtNmJmNzFkZWExNjA5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg","description":"Season 11 of Vera arrives on BritBox September 1st."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Carney took a risk in choosing professional musicians over professional actors, but Glen Hansard (of the well-known Irish band the Frames) and Marketa Irglova (a Czech singer/songwriter) are not only remarkably charming together but they're equally adept with the more melancholy shades (Hansard's lonely soul, stuck on an old flame; Irglova struggling to support a mother and daughter). Burdened and brokenhearted, their musical bond is the heart of the film and of their love. \n\nGreat music aside, what makes this film special is how little effort it seems to exert.

It is said that after his friend and rival James Whistler had made a particularly apposite remark, Wilde sighed and said "I wish I had said that!". Whistler's reply was "You will, Oscar, you will". The American film industry has a similar attitude to other people's films to the one that Wilde had to other people's conversation. When the European- particularly the British or French- film industry comes up with a particularly admired film, Hollywood gives a collective sigh and says "We wish we had made that!" You will, Hollywood, you will!\n\nRecent years have seen a glut of remakes of European films, but, admittedly, the results of this creative plagiarism are by no means always bad. The plot of "Sommersby" may have been blatantly lifted from "Le Retour de Martin Guerre", but it is still a good film in its own right. Moreover, I was one of those who thought that Luc Besson's "Nikita" did not lose much in translation when it was remade as the Bridget Fonda vehicle "The Assassin". Sometimes, however, Hollywood manages to come up with a remake that is so inferior to its original model that the two films do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. "Diabolique" is a case in point.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot's "Les Diaboliques" was one of the classic thrillers of the fifties, as good as the best of Hitchcock's work. Jeremiah Chechik's remake borrows the same basic plot of the original, but transfers it from 1950s France to 1990s America. At the centre is the sadistic headmaster of a private school, a man who brutally mistreats not only the boys in his care but also his wife and even his beautiful mistress. The wife and mistress,tired of his mistreatment, plot together to murder him and to dispose of his body in the filthy school swimming pool, but when the pool is later drained the body has disappeared. As in the original, there is a sudden, surprise twist at the end. Chechik also, however,introduces elements that were not in Clouzot's film. The wife, Mia, here becomes a former nun, who has renounced her vows after losing her faith, but is still haunted by guilt. There is a suggestion of a lesbian relationship between Mia and the mistress, Nicole. Chechik also introduces a major character, in the form of a female detective, with no equivalent in the original film.\n\n"Diabolique" has come in for some sharp criticism, largely because it is a remake of a classic. It is a mediocre film rather than a horrendously bad one, and if we did not have its famous predecessor to compare it with, it would doubtless be seen as just another banal and unsuccessful crime thriller. Nevertheless, I think that the criticism it has attracted is justified. Chechik must have known that one of the perils of remaking a film is that your work will be weighed in the balance against the original, and woe betide you if it is found wanting. And, compared with Clouzot's, Chechik's film is wanting indeed. He lacks the French director's sense of pacing and ability to convey suspense, with the result that his film is slow-moving where the original was brisk and flabby where the original was taut.\n\nI was also disappointed by the acting. Isabelle Adjani can be a fine actress in her own language, as she showed in "La Reine Margot", but I have not been impressed with her in English-language films, and here her character never came to life. Sharon Stone was slightly better as the hard-bitten, sluttish Nicole, but this was not really one of her better performances and did nothing to alter my view that she has not always chosen the best vehicles in which to show off her talents. Chazz Palminteri's headmaster was almost too unpleasant to be believable, and Kathy Bates seemed wasted as the detective. Watching Clouzot's film I was glued to the screen with anticipation as I wondered how the film would end; watching Chechik's, my attention was rather glued to my watch as I wondered when it would end. 4/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14083,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1996-10-28","keywords":"stockings,woman on top,dead body in a bathtub,dead body in a car,death in a bathtub","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Diabolique","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi950141209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000254/","name":"Isabelle Adjani"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154819/","name":"Jeremiah S.

It is said that after his friend and rival James Whistler had made a particularly apposite remark, Wilde sighed and said "I wish I had said that!". Whistler's reply was "You will, Oscar, you will". The American film industry has a similar attitude to other people's films to the one that Wilde had to other people's conversation. When the European- particularly the British or French- film industry comes up with a particularly admired film, Hollywood gives a collective sigh and says "We wish we had made that!" You will, Hollywood, you will!\n\nRecent years have seen a glut of remakes of European films, but, admittedly, the results of this creative plagiarism are by no means always bad. The plot of "Sommersby" may have been blatantly lifted from "Le Retour de Martin Guerre", but it is still a good film in its own right. Moreover, I was one of those who thought that Luc Besson's "Nikita" did not lose much in translation when it was remade as the Bridget Fonda vehicle "The Assassin".

The usage of mirrors, shadows and following the character would seem Kubrick inspired. \n\nThe director chose his way of ending the story which is purely is his prerogative which perhaps for a few it might seem Over-the-top.\n\nPS:: And an apt title indeed.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1243,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-06-09","keywords":"incest,caught having sex,male frontal nudity,bare breasts,female full frontal nudity","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0051822/","name":"Cristina Banegas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266723/","name":"Daniel Fanego","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1738113/","name":"Lucas Escariz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0140337/","name":"Albertina Carri"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108406/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0064529/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0097718/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0140337/","name":"Albertina Carri","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0320622/","name":"Santiago Giralt"],"duration":"PT1H25M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The reviews weren't kind (though a number of reliable critics, including Ebert &amp; Roeper, Rob Blackwell, and David Cornelius gave it positive marks), so undoubtedly low expectations on my part made this a more enjoyable venture for me,  or maybe it's just a solid action/comedy.  Either way, this continues my personal Harrison Ford streak (dating back to Star Wars, there hasn't been a movie of his I've seen that I've genuinely disliked, not even the strictly mediocre Random Hearts).\n\nFord stars as Joe Gavilan, a Hollywood detective moonlighting as a real-estate broker who's desperate to sell a house just to pay off his mortgage and alimony payments.  His partner, the much younger K.C. Calden (Josh Hartnett), is also a yoga instructor/aspiring actor.  Their latest case involves the murder of a group of rappers, a hit possibly called by producer Antoine Sartain (Isaiah Washington).  But their attempts to solve the crime are hindered by an I.A. investigation led by Bennie Macko (Bruce Greenwood), an old rival of Gavilan's who's determined to make his life a living hell.\n\nFor about the first twenty minutes, Hollywood Homicide stumbles and sputters with awkwardly placed jokes involving food orders and real estate deals. But the randomness of the jokes and the situations improved and grew on me. It's part of the movie's appeal, basically focusing on two cops who have more pressing concerns on their minds than the homicide case they're on. As a matter of fact, the "main" plot is barely given any genuine development, it's just there to provide the movie with a frame with which the leads can interact and get into some physical action.\n\nThe movie's success lies mainly with leads Ford and Hartnett, who, surprisingly, aren't the typical mis-matched buddy pairing I was expecting (they actually get along pretty well).  Ford's talent with comedy is not a surprise, his gruff manner and deadpan approach is perfect for this material.  The running cell phone and real estate gag would normally feel out of place and probably fall flat, but in Ford's capbable hands, the gags are often hilarious. Hartnett is just right as the playboy movie star-wannabe, not exactly a stretch for the young actor, but still a decent performance.\n\nDespite virtually no action in the opening hour, the movie climaxes with a twenty-minute, non-stop action sequence that's filled with car and foot chases, shootouts, and a couple of scuffles and fistfights.  It's a thrilling segment that's easily the movie's highlight.  There are several memorable comic setpieces: a chase involving a paddleboat, an I.A. interrogation constantly interrupted by cell phone calls, Ford chasing a villain with a girl's bike (actually my favorite scene of the whole film), Hartnett commandeering an SUV with a family of passengers still inside, and a bloodied Ford brandishing a gun and making the finishing touches on a real estate deal in an elevator full of frightened women.  Incidentally, three of those scenes are set in the final half-hour, accompanying the action sequences.\n\nHollywood Homicide's not without its fair share of flaws.  The film boasts one subplot too many, mainly in Ford's underdeveloped romance with a psychic (Lena Holin), Hartnett's acting goals, and a silly "father who was a cop, but was killed in the line of duty" cliche storyline that should have been completely excised.  The Gavilan-Macko rivalry is lazily resolved, more of an afterthought on the filmmaker's part than an actual conclusion.  One scene involving a handcuffed prisoner with a loaded gun is just pointless; I said before the movie's random storylines were part of its charm but this is a little too random.\n\nBut the movie succeeds at what it intends to be, a buddy-cop comedy where the cops actually feel like buddies and not hot-headed partners always at each other's throats over trivial matters.  Such an approach may be what you're expecting, but believe me, the movie feels much fresher the way it is and is all the more enjoyable for that reason."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":36877,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2003-10-08","keywords":"criminal investigation,murder investigation,usa,united states,murder","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hollywood Homicide","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2091712793","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjU4NWNlZGEtMzQ3Yi00MzNiLTkxNTEtMDVhNTI4YTMwYzYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjU4NWNlZGEtMzQ3Yi00MzNiLTkxNTEtMDVhNTI4YTMwYzYzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001326/","name":"Josh Hartnett"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913460/","name":"Isaiah Washington"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005421/","name":"Ron Shelton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0177995/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0034610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1226736/","name":"Robert Souza"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005421/","name":"Ron Shelton"}],"duration":"PT1H56M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's not awesome, but it's pretty good.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35945,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-04-03","keywords":"dead female police officer,female police officer deceased,cigarette,body lands on a car,creature feature","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Splinter: Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2440232985","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTc5Nzc1MTk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY2MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTc5Nzc1MTk5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODY2MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the theatrical trailer for Splinter, directed by Toby Wilkins.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0924154/","name":"Shea Whigham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1489978/","name":"Jill Wagner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0182455/","name":"Paulo Costanzo"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0929317/","name":"Toby Wilkins"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0143763/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0219575/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0215483/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2135380/","name":"Ian Shorr","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2649739/","name":"Kai Barry","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0929317/","name":"Toby Wilkins"],"duration":"PT1H22M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The Jabberwock itself is made with CG, and is relatively acceptable.\n\nThe action and fighting parts of the movie are the worst: the camera shifts from views from the men branding swords, and the CG monster, like bad movies of the 60-70's, among many other incongruence in story and actions that occurs.\n\nBy the way, "Jabberwocky" is a poem from Lewis Caroll, that appears in the sequences of the book Alice in Wonderland - and many things are related to it in the film) - I don't know and don't want to know why they done this (in general all writers from Scy-Fy Channel are the worst writers that I've seen).\n\nThe sound effects and background music you don't even realize if they were good or not, since they are generic, and in a absolute background in the movie.\n\nAt the end, this is a very bad choice of movie, even to watch if there's nothing interesting in the TV: I had the displeasure of watching it in 720p. \n\nI'd advise to stay away from the Jabberwock - my score: 2,0 / 10,0.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":660,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2011-09-10","keywords":"sword and sorcery,monster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Curse of the Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4222331673","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTczZTkxMjctMTBlYi00YjZlLWJhOGItNjEyYTYxYmE2Y2E4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTczZTkxMjctMTBlYi00YjZlLWJhOGItNjEyYTYxYmE2Y2E4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Curse of the Dragon","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0671886/","name":"Tahmoh Penikett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0056041/","name":"Kacey Clarke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0214860/","name":"Raffaello Degruttola"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003458/","name":"Steven R.

Unfortunately, the story was bland and the jokes were only mildly funny, so it will not be one of the best kids movies you're going to see this year. The "Laugh out loud" index was maybe a 5-10 (laughs per movie). "Over the Hedge" was closer to 20-30 for comparative purposes. "Boog" and "Elliot" were well played.

He goes alone and stumbles on to a circus and a beautiful female bear named Ursa. Switching places with a male bear named Doug, his friends in the forest soon become worried.\n\nThe reviews for this film are not stellar, and I think I can sum up why: the original voice cast is not involved in this picture, so the characters sound funny. The plot is thin, and the movie comes in under 90 minutes, letting you know that they didn't have a strong story (even including the dogs and cats seems forced because it is not related to the main story at all).\n\nFor me, I liked the film. I don't have a strong attachment to the original, so I wasn't as offended. And I think kids will like it. Sure, the voice for Boog was annoying... but then, I loved the dogs and cats, so it's a toss-up. I felt like this was going to be a launching pad for a TV series, because it has a "Madagascar" feel to it... but with its poor reception, that may not be likely.\n\nIf you have kids, let them check it out. They may be less cynical than adult viewers, and it's not all bad. I learned what a camelid is... that may be worth the price of renting the film. But then again, maybe not. My girlfriend watched it with me and fell asleep... what does that tell you?","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11099,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-01-25","keywords":"russian,circus,prince and pauper,look alike,role reversal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Open Season 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi205691161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NjExNjI0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NjExNjI0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Boog's friends really to bring him home from a Russian traveling circus."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3103829/","name":"Matthew J.

He goes alone and stumbles on to a circus and a beautiful female bear named Ursa. Switching places with a male bear named Doug, his friends in the forest soon become worried.\n\nThe reviews for this film are not stellar, and I think I can sum up why: the original voice cast is not involved in this picture, so the characters sound funny. The plot is thin, and the movie comes in under 90 minutes, letting you know that they didn't have a strong story (even including the dogs and cats seems forced because it is not related to the main story at all).\n\nFor me, I liked the film. I don't have a strong attachment to the original, so I wasn't as offended. And I think kids will like it. Sure, the voice for Boog was annoying... but then, I loved the dogs and cats, so it's a toss-up. I felt like this was going to be a launching pad for a TV series, because it has a "Madagascar" feel to it... but with its poor reception, that may not be likely.\n\nIf you have kids, let them check it out. They may be less cynical than adult viewers, and it's not all bad. I learned what a camelid is... that may be worth the price of renting the film. But then again, maybe not. My girlfriend watched it with me and fell asleep... what does that tell you?","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11099,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2011-01-25","keywords":"russian,circus,prince and pauper,look alike,role reversal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Open Season 3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi205691161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NjExNjI0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ4NjExNjI0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg3MTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Boog's friends really to bring him home from a Russian traveling circus.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3103829/","name":"Matthew J.

Supposedly based on a Korean comic or "manhwa" of same name, the movie "Priest" has NOTHING to do with the original, not even the name of the squinting "strong silent type" main protagonist played by Paul Bettany. Fallen angels, deal with a demon, multiple time frame story lines and all other interesting elements of the original be damned. And perhaps it was for the better since the manhwa's multiple story lines taking place in the Crusades, the old west and the future would just confuse the heck out of everyone.\n\nSo they crafted a whole new premise to appeal to the superficial summer action lover. And the one thing they did right was to give us vampires that do not sparkle in the sunlight. These vampires are all teeth and claws who swarm across the world at night attacking from giant hives, a clear reference to the "Aliens" franchise. These savage beasts have been at constant war with mankind since the dawn of time. A beautifully bloody animated prologue sets the back-story of the film about how mankind's salvation came in the form of the Priests, holy warriors who battled the vampire hordes to near extinction.\n\nThis story revolves around one of the veteran priests who lives among the other downtrodden human inhabitants of a walled dystopian city ruled by the now totalitarian church. When he receives word that his niece was abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, the priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out of the city and rescue her. He is joined on his crusade by his niece's boyfriend, a young trigger-finger wasteland sheriff. But as the duo soon discover, reports of the vampires' return have been greatly understated. With a powerful yet familiar threat is leading the newly reformed vampire hordes, the wayward Priest and his companion must fend off supernatural foes and contend with a group of fellow Priests sent to hunt down their rogue brother.\n\n"Priest" is one cliché storm of a film that commits the cardinal sins of a paper thin plot and forgettable characters thanks to the inexperience of first time writer Cory Goodman. The characters are so forgettable that the writer never even bothered to give many of them names. Paul Bettany's main character is just called "Priest" (It is not his name by the way). There is also "Black Hat" (because he wears a black hat) and "The Priestess" (because she is a female priest) just to name a few. They are less like actual characters and more like blank character archetypes thrown in for plot convenience. Archetypes like Cam Gigandet's hot headed Sheriff Hicks (a second reference to Aliens perhaps?) and Lily Collin's damsel in distress Lucy are just as forgettable even though they do have names.\n\nFailing to provide interesting characters or a good story, the least the producers could do was to deliver a holy hell load of violence with a hard R or M18 rating. Sadly the animated prologue has more blood and guts than the entire film combined since most of the gorier battles take place in darkness or amid dust. The Fights are well choreographed but they tend to be more stylish than practical and sometimes border on illogical. For example, a duel on a high speed train is awesome but none of the combatants ever thought of kicking his opponent off the side? But despite these failings of the flesh, some salvation comes to "Priest" in the form of an excellent production design. From the dark cyberpunk inspired Church city to the post apocalyptic western towns dotting the hostile desert lands, great attention had been paid to make those places as believable as possible. Perhaps most memorable would be the tech on display in the film which includes futuristic motorcycles, tricked out shotguns and the Priests' arsenal of deadly cross-themed blade weapons.\n\nBeyond the props, flawless visual effects and startling CGI, the movie tries as well to inject its narrative with deeper subtexts. The Priests themselves call to mind stories of War veterans who were shunned by society and unable to re-integrate, a theme made most famous in "Rambo: First Blood". The film also makes fun of how some churches twist their religion into a means of control, the hypocritical "holier-than-thou" attitude of modern Christians and their single minded belief that they remain "saved from evil" as long as they worship God. It is not intentionally "anti-Christian" or "anti-catholic". It is more of a clever satire but there will always be the more conservative ones who would cry sacrilege.\n\nAt only 87 minutes long, Priest moves at a brisk pace and at the very least it is not boring. It would no doubt entertain action junkies and fans of post apocalyptic thrillers although more time could have been spent developing the characters or delving into the underlying themes that were addressed. Priest is spectacular but soulless, with a nice looking "body" but barely enough "blood" and "spirit" to satisfy the more sophisticated movie goer.\n\n6.5/10 Rounded down to 6","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118298,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"keywords":"vampire,priest,church,warrior,vampire hunter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Priest: Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4157250841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NjcwNzAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczNTM5NA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NjcwNzAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczNTM5NA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A priest disobeys church law to track down the vampires who kidnapped his niece."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0079273/","name":"Paul Bettany"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1544217/","name":"Cam Gigandet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702572/","name":"Maggie Q"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829820/","name":"Scott Stewart"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174505/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242736/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2309430/","name":"Cory Goodman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2312828/","name":"Min-Woo Hyung"}],"duration":"PT1H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

After getting hooked on fun, entertaining shows like The Good Cop and Battle Creek only to have them cancelled after one season, I give up trying to figure out today's viewers. No, LA's Finest isn't perfect (or totally realistic, but hey, what show is?). Yet it's pretty engaging. The story lines keep me coming back for more episodes and I think the acting is pretty good.

He is looking to reconnect with estranged brother Sebastian Graves (Mark Strong). Sebastian is now a gunman for an MI6 offshoot. His investigation leads to actress philanthropist Rhonda George (Penelope Cruz). Nobby's interference causes Sebastian to be blamed for an assassination. Sebastian is forced to team up with his secret brother Nobby.\n\nNobby is partially annoying. Once I get over it, his idiocy is a little funny. It's all silly and outrageous. I'm half rolling my eyes, and half smirking in disbelief. I'm bored with the poop jokes and the more obvious stuff. The shock humor is over the top. On the other hand, SBC often hits the audience with some unexpected humor. It's a real mix bag.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":98216,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-02-24","keywords":"gay joke,bare breasts,public nudity,sex in public,water hose","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3359027737","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MzMyNDAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzMyNjU0NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1MzMyNDAyOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzMyNjU0NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When Sebastian Graves, a deadly MI6 agent, takes on a mission to prevent a massive global terror attack, he must unfortunately reunite with his long-lost brother Nobby, a sweet but dimwitted English football hooligan ... proving that behind every great spy is an embarrassing sibling.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0056187/","name":"Sacha Baron Cohen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0835016/","name":"Mark Strong","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2313103/","name":"Rebel Wilson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504642/","name":"Louis Leterrier"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0255853/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0131363/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0056187/","name":"Sacha Baron Cohen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1601882/","name":"Phil Johnston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0063165/","name":"Peter Baynham"],"duration":"PT1H23M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is that mysterious link that film stars create with their audiences. We develop a sort of craving to see them again. So a new Julia Roberts movie? Sure. Absolutely. I'm only a few years younger than Julia Roberts which means we have grown together. So, to see her play a woman facing a sort of middle age crisis makes you look inwards with a smile, the nervous kind. I must also say I'm a guy, heterosexual, but not fanatically so. I don't have the fears that, Jay Leno for instance, shows, when confronted by a "chick flick" If anything "Eat Pray Love" proves that men and women are not that far apart, we simply deal with the same problems in different ways. Here, the filmmakers don't shy away from the conflict and the balance is real. Julia's husband, played beautifully by Billy Crudup, accuses her of leaving the marriage without an explanation. He is the one with the broken heart. In Italy, Julia eats and our own gastric juices start to do their thing. I glanced at my watch, I was ready to run into the nearest Italian restaurant and have a relationship with a pizza myself. Italy, Rome and even Naples look so clean that I hardly recognized it. CGI? Luca Argentero plays Julia's tutor/tourist guide. He is a good looking guy that after appearing in the Italian version of the Big Brother reality show, he became a sort of local movie star and shows promising acting chops. Here, strangely enough, he looks small but charming all the same. India brings the wonderful Richard Jenkins and a solid piece of advise: "don't give up on love" Bali, well, Bali is something else and it is there that Javier Bardem comes into the picture and provides us with the best scene in the film. I'm not going to tell you what it is but let me just say that involves his son and gives us, finally, a side of Julia we didn't know how much we missed. Empathy. Feeling something for somebody else's feelings. I think I may see the film a second time just to see that scene again. I also should mention that James Franco plays a young actor - not what I call a stretch - considering he is my favorite of the young actors around. I will challenge other members of my sex to go and see it. Not to be afraid to feel identified or even chocked up. I can assure you it's not going to diminish you manliness in any way and will awake your appetites, big time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":93565,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2010-10-06","keywords":"emotional balance,indonesia,inner peace,young woman,usa","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Eat Pray Love: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2996176409","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTU5MTczNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0NTM2Mw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzNTU5MTczNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTk0NTM2Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Happily married Elizabeth Gilbert (Roberts) takes a right turn in her life by enduring a painful divorce and proceeding to take a round-the-world journey of self-enlightenment and fulfillment.

I had no expectations, those I had were rather negative. Being that the only movie I've ever watched Jimmy in is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifah(?)...don't ask why! But seriously..this movie is so cute! Drew Barrymore is always sweet, but I almost fell in love with Fallon's character. Why can't I meet a cute nerd like that. :) Movies like that are excellent.

Niestety, okazuje się, że nie ma ona nic wspólnego z rajem.

The animation team has accomplished something truly spectacular; watching "The Prince of Egypt" is like seeing life breathed into a rich, luxurious tapestry. The Biblical story told in the books of Genesis and Exodus is followed very faithfully, with only minor changes made for dramatic reasons. The action sequences are truly exciting, overall pacing is excellent, and the miracles wrought by God are depicted with awed and respectful wonder. One truly astonishing, harrowing sequence recounts the slaughter of firstborn Hebrew children by bringing hieroglyphic drawings to life on the walls of an Egyptian temple. The voice work is especially good--Val Kilmer is fine as Moses, and Pharoah, voiced by Ralph Fiennes, positively seethes with arrogance and hubris. The storytellers wisely chose to end their tale at the climactic crossing of the Red Sea; even the delivery of the Ten Commandments is portrayed only in an epilogue vignette. (After all, the Israelites wander in the wilderness for forty years after that, and Moses ultimately is not allowed to enter the Promised Land--perhaps not the uplifting ending the filmmakers had in mind.) Some of the subject matter is dark and disturbing, and there is no shying away from the harsh realities of the original texts. By all means, see it with the children in your life--and be prepared to discuss it with them afterward.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":125732,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1998-12-16","keywords":"hebrew,ancient egypt,miracle,brother versus brother,bible story","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Prince of Egypt","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2683437337","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBlYzFhNzMtNWM2My00MmRhLTkxOTgtODdjMWM2OWMyZGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODBlYzFhNzMtNWM2My00MmRhLTkxOTgtODdjMWM2OWMyZGJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Dreamworks Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000174/","name":"Val Kilmer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000146/","name":"Ralph Fiennes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0152312/","name":"Brenda Chapman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9054338/","name":"Steve Hickner"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0920425/","name":"Simon Wells"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0129164/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0493857/","name":"Philip LaZebnik"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0583292/","name":"Nicholas Meyer"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.\n\nSpielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.\n\nWhile titled "Lincoln," we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.\n\nOne requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.\n\nWith this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.\n\nBut that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley.

Virtually every (French) male character is either selfish, arrogant, slimy, stupid or all of the above. Is every French man so worthless? \n\nWhy set a film in France if you are only going to ridicule and complain about the French? It's as if the filmmakers seem to think that only Americans know what is truly right and wrong and everyone else is either backwards or dumb. \n\nThe American attitude to other cultures is so condescending that one feels physically sick. In one scene, Glen Close's character thinks aloud about writing a book about the French and their strange ways, as if she were a Christian missionary or Imperialist, wanting to chronicle the quaint ways of the 'natives'.

Virtually every (French) male character is either selfish, arrogant, slimy, stupid or all of the above. Is every French man so worthless? \n\nWhy set a film in France if you are only going to ridicule and complain about the French? It's as if the filmmakers seem to think that only Americans know what is truly right and wrong and everyone else is either backwards or dumb. \n\nThe American attitude to other cultures is so condescending that one feels physically sick. In one scene, Glen Close's character thinks aloud about writing a book about the French and their strange ways, as if she were a Christian missionary or Imperialist, wanting to chronicle the quaint ways of the 'natives'. In another scene on a train someone asks "Is this the Middle Ages?", with the reply being, "No, this is France". Since Americans in general seem so intimidated by European culture and intelligence they feel they must deride all native Europeans in such a manner. \n\n Naomi Watts, someone whom I admire greatly, was so uninteresting and morose that I was glad whenever she left a scene. Whenever someone voiced an opinion or idea that was not 'hip-PC' then her character would grumble.\n\n'Le Divorce' was tough going, it wasn't entertaining in any way, nor is it a film I would recommend to anyone else.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-08-29","keywords":"american,french,love,sex,france","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Le Divorce","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1636958489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODIxZDhmOTUtZDE5OS00M2RlLWJkM2ItYjQxMjE2YWE0MjE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODIxZDhmOTUtZDE5OS00M2RlLWJkM2ItYjQxMjE2YWE0MjE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005028/","name":"Kate Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000330/","name":"Stockard Channing"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412465/","name":"James Ivory"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055367/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424956/","name":"Diane Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695609/","name":"Ruth Prawer Jhabvala","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412465/","name":"James Ivory"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is very 'Twilight Zone' with an ending I didn't anticipate.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":17761,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2020-07-10","keywords":"dead wife,husband wife relationship,fatal car accident,artificial intelligence,surprise ending","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3911368217","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg2ZTIxNDItM2Y4OC00YThiLTkwYmQtMjcxZWUwYTRjM2NlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg2ZTIxNDItM2Y4OC00YThiLTkwYmQtMjcxZWUwYTRjM2NlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"2038: George Almore is working on a true human-equivalent AI.

From the acting, script, direction, plot and overall execution it just falls flat on its face. And while some films fall into the category of so bad it's good, Dead Trigger is just plain bad.\n\nThe plot is all over the place, stuff happens with little to no logic or explanation given. None of the protagonists make any sort of impact whatsoever. I've seen cereal boxes with more personality and when anyone dies the only thing you feel is indifference.\n\nDolph Lundgren spends the entire movie with a dish cloth round his neck. I don't know why.\n\nThe only scene that stands out is the one where a recruit, who was boasting about his shooting prowess, comes face to face with a zombie, freezes in terror and drops his shotgun, somehow blowing his head off.\n\nIf you like zombie movies avoid this like the plague.\n\nIf you like Dolph Lundgren movies go elsewhere. This is really not worth your time or money.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1086,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-05-03","keywords":"game,low budget sci fi movie,zombie,year 2025,boxing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"DEAD TRIGGER Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1140636953","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFhZDUzZTItNzJiNi00MGMwLWI0Y2YtN2Q0NGUyYmVjYmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFhZDUzZTItNzJiNi00MGMwLWI0Y2YtN2Q0NGUyYmVjYmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000185/","name":"Dolph Lundgren"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1032208/","name":"Autumn Reeser"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1498137/","name":"Brooke Johnston"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0191242/","name":"Mike Cuff"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934698/","name":"Scott Windhauser"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0335687/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0431931/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0316584/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5566894/","name":"Heinz Treschnitzer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0191242/","name":"Mike Cuff"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934698/","name":"Scott Windhauser"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

From the acting, script, direction, plot and overall execution it just falls flat on its face. And while some films fall into the category of so bad it's good, Dead Trigger is just plain bad.\n\nThe plot is all over the place, stuff happens with little to no logic or explanation given. None of the protagonists make any sort of impact whatsoever. I've seen cereal boxes with more personality and when anyone dies the only thing you feel is indifference.\n\nDolph Lundgren spends the entire movie with a dish cloth round his neck. I don't know why.\n\nThe only scene that stands out is the one where a recruit, who was boasting about his shooting prowess, comes face to face with a zombie, freezes in terror and drops his shotgun, somehow blowing his head off.\n\nIf you like zombie movies avoid this like the plague.\n\nIf you like Dolph Lundgren movies go elsewhere. This is really not worth your time or money.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1086,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2019-05-03","keywords":"game,low budget sci fi movie,zombie,year 2025,boxing","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"DEAD TRIGGER Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1140636953","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFhZDUzZTItNzJiNi00MGMwLWI0Y2YtN2Q0NGUyYmVjYmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFhZDUzZTItNzJiNi00MGMwLWI0Y2YtN2Q0NGUyYmVjYmJiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000185/","name":"Dolph Lundgren","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1032208/","name":"Autumn Reeser","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1498137/","name":"Brooke Johnston"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0191242/","name":"Mike Cuff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934698/","name":"Scott Windhauser"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0335687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0431931/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0316584/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5566894/","name":"Heinz Treschnitzer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0191242/","name":"Mike Cuff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934698/","name":"Scott Windhauser"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Now i love a good coming-of-age story, so when one is done right and is new and interesting it will probably be something i choose to watch more than once. Unfortunately this will not be one i am eager to re-watch but it is still a good, strong attempt at one of these films but it seems to get lost a few times along the way in terms of its storytelling. I'll start with the characters and performances, because i feel they were definitely the best parts of the film and added so much to making the film pretty enjoyable. Nat Wolff was great at playing Quentin, a shy awkward guy who had a signs of a lot of personality but needed the right people to bring it out. You really get to connect with his character as they made him come across as very real and not like a character per se. I may say that often but there are so many young actors really showing off their best stuff in these smaller personal films. Cara Delevingne was also great as Margo who was also quite odd and mysterious but was also very out there and confident at the same time, a great contrast to Nat's character. The rest of the supporting cast were also well acted, their distinct personalities were at times used for some cheap comedic relief but also had a greater purpose in adding to the complexity of our main character.\n\nThe first act of this film is really where the film gets to shine. You get the introduction to these characters (Quentin and Margo) and get to see their relationship and how it has changed and affected both these characters in the lead up to the events in the film. Watching them interact and bond was fascinating and charming at times and was a really good lead up into the events of the second act and understanding their actions. It was fun, light-hearted and was setting itself up for something great. All of the events so far had a fluid lead in to the second act which became more of a mysterious adventure whilst still trying to maintain that fun element somewhat unsuccessfully. The events of the first act are what get you through the very long second act that could have been cut down like 20 minutes. The second act was more focused on building up Quentin's character and having him face some tough and new decisions in his life. Although it was interesting and you do want to see where his character goes it was a noticeable step down from the fun light-hearted enjoyment in the beginning. There was this great interesting relationship set up and you are eager to find out how the film ties everything together, then you reach the third act and all of the storytelling falls apart. \n\nFor certain characters, their actions and reactions seem somewhat justified but for some others they just felt like another character entirely. There was nothing in the second act that really explained how or why these characters made such a drastic change in reasoning or personality. They try to explain it in the dying minutes but it was very rushed and didn't fit with the rest of the film. The problem was that there was no real progression from the events of the beginning to the events in the end for some characters and that led me to believe that the writers/directors knew how to approach certain sections but were completely lost for others. I believe, they knew how they wanted the film to begin and how to introduce these characters, and they also knew how they wanted it to end and what themes they wanted to explore. But what they didn't know was how to show that transition, and when a film has the beginning, and has the end it can be hard to fill in the guts of the film afterwards and show a distinct character progression. That's just my theory but whatever happened the storytelling was a bit of a mess. \n\nThat being said, it was still a good enjoyable film that tried too hard to be different or maybe not hard enough. It had great characters and performances, a fantastic first act, an interesting second act and a third act that didn't live up to what the rest of the film was building up to. Humour didn't really work that often but kept the film from becoming too dark, and there were signs of emotion but nothing that really affects you. In the end, it's enjoyable but there are better coming-of-age films out there (Boyhood / Me and Earl and the Dying Girl). - 6.3","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99680,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

The rest of the supporting cast were also well acted, their distinct personalities were at times used for some cheap comedic relief but also had a greater purpose in adding to the complexity of our main character.\n\nThe first act of this film is really where the film gets to shine. You get the introduction to these characters (Quentin and Margo) and get to see their relationship and how it has changed and affected both these characters in the lead up to the events in the film. Watching them interact and bond was fascinating and charming at times and was a really good lead up into the events of the second act and understanding their actions. It was fun, light-hearted and was setting itself up for something great. All of the events so far had a fluid lead in to the second act which became more of a mysterious adventure whilst still trying to maintain that fun element somewhat unsuccessfully. The events of the first act are what get you through the very long second act that could have been cut down like 20 minutes. The second act was more focused on building up Quentin's character and having him face some tough and new decisions in his life. Although it was interesting and you do want to see where his character goes it was a noticeable step down from the fun light-hearted enjoyment in the beginning. There was this great interesting relationship set up and you are eager to find out how the film ties everything together, then you reach the third act and all of the storytelling falls apart. \n\nFor certain characters, their actions and reactions seem somewhat justified but for some others they just felt like another character entirely. There was nothing in the second act that really explained how or why these characters made such a drastic change in reasoning or personality. They try to explain it in the dying minutes but it was very rushed and didn't fit with the rest of the film. The problem was that there was no real progression from the events of the beginning to the events in the end for some characters and that led me to believe that the writers/directors knew how to approach certain sections but were completely lost for others. I believe, they knew how they wanted the film to begin and how to introduce these characters, and they also knew how they wanted it to end and what themes they wanted to explore. But what they didn't know was how to show that transition, and when a film has the beginning, and has the end it can be hard to fill in the guts of the film afterwards and show a distinct character progression. That's just my theory but whatever happened the storytelling was a bit of a mess. \n\nThat being said, it was still a good enjoyable film that tried too hard to be different or maybe not hard enough. It had great characters and performances, a fantastic first act, an interesting second act and a third act that didn't live up to what the rest of the film was building up to. Humour didn't really work that often but kept the film from becoming too dark, and there were signs of emotion but nothing that really affects you. In the end, it's enjoyable but there are better coming-of-age films out there (Boyhood / Me and Earl and the Dying Girl). - 6.3","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":99680,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-07-24","keywords":"based on novel,travel,teenage girl,unrequited love,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2452795417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTkyNjAxNDc3MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDMxNDg4NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A coming-of-age story centering on Quentin and his enigmatic neighbor Margo, who loved mysteries so much she became one.

    <title lang="en">A Love Yarn</title>
    <desc lang="pl">A Love Yarn: Directed by Peter Burger. With Anna Hutchison, Simon Arblaster, Olivia Tennet, Annie Whittle. The owner of a quaint New Zealand yarn shop, Sophie Markham, gets her world flipped upside down after learning her top supplier of yarn, King Farms, is stopping production. Much to her surprise, the charming yet stuck-in-his-ways Samuel King has traveled all the way from New York to audit the business model of the farm.

Perhaps writing/editting and starring in the film robbed him too much of objectivity when it came to actually watching this bit of a non-story. He portrays "Max", a young French-Canadian man who is about to emigrate to Australia. At a party with his childhood friends, he and handsome best pal Matt (Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas) get lumbered with starring in a video being made by one of their number's pesky younger sister. The scene involved the two of them kissing - something neither had done (as an adult) with a man before. What ensues is a slow, deliberately so, depiction of the complications that this kiss has on their relationship. "Matt" has a long term girlfriend, so his reconciliation with his "new" feelings for his friend take on a different guise from those of the single "Max" who has issues with his recovering addict mother. Sadly, though, too much of those repercussions are presumed on us by the director and not demonstrated to the audience. It doesn't need to be a cheesy traditional romance, nor a sex fest, but we are left to imagine or envisage that they want each other only because we know that's what the film is about - not because we are presented with much tangible, or even implied, sense of desire. Indeed the others in their group more readily flirt and banter than the two in the title. It doesn't have a beginning, middle and end - it just has a middle. A rather interestingly filmed and quite well put together middle, but a middle nonetheless. Certainly worth watching - I think Dolan has something about him - but I wanted more from the characters and the story - as it is I just felt like a rather unsatisfied observer.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6595,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2019-10-09","keywords":"gay character,friendship,kiss,in love with best friend,mother son relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer [OVS]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi707182105","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNjNTgxYjYtNzI1OS00MzUwLWE5MTEtMjJhZDZhMTllZDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNjNTgxYjYtNzI1OS00MzUwLWE5MTEtMjJhZDZhMTllZDQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8570499/","name":"Gabriel D'Almeida Freitas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2954178/","name":"Pier-Luc Funk"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0489666/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053578/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093053/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230859/","name":"Xavier Dolan"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I'm not against sequels mind you, but in most kids series seldom is any sequel as good as the first installment. This is the case for this past weekend's release starring the ever wacky Ben Stiller and his posse of celebrities. Yes my friends we take another trip back to the museum, for another hopefully fun adventure amidst it's hallowed halls. So sit back and read a late review of another Night at the Museum, the Secret of the Tomb. \n\nLikes: One thing I have always liked with this series is the selection of exhibits they choose to bring to life, and the integration of their personalities. This installment brings the magic early on, bringing back familiar faces like Teddy (Robin Williams), Jed (Owen Wilson), and Octavius (Steve Coogan) in all their comedic glory. Amidst a grand speech, cool CGI effects are put into effect to bring the constellations alive that shine in all their cool blue light before chaos arises. Once we get to the London museum, more exciting things come alive, in the form of another CGI fossil, a mythical snake demon made of metal, and the warrior with golden locks Lancelot (Dan Stevens). The effects are fluid, the designs beautiful, and when actually integrated into the movie, more on that later, you get the fun feeling you got in the first movie. Unfortunately most of these objects are background, aimlessly wandering around the scene while the big boys come out to play. \n\nOutside of the special effects there are some fun pokes at human society's obsessions, especially at internet videos, pop culture, and of course ridiculous habits that celebrities have. Some of these jokes are well timed, often delivered in a manner that is quite funny. However, many of the jokes, as happens most of the time, lose their charm and the lack of any witty humor makes it pretty much just mindless rambling that kids will only enjoy. Oh sure it's cute, but Hollywood needs to learn that more isn't necessary funnier, in fact it's the opposite. However, audiences allow them to get away with it, so what is the use in complaining. \n\nNow past funny, this Night at the Museum has another emotional side to it, helping to teach the moral lesson of moving on in the magical theatrical way. With the use of orchestrated symphony work, well angled camera shots, decent writing, and of course great acting, I'll admit I got that tingly feeling all over. No it's not gas, but those looking for a life lesson reminder will get it in this film, and a decent closing to the series  I think. As for acting, well Stiller gets the most screen time on this one. The verdict, it's alright  when he's not acting like a buffoon, and the man has some surprising agility and giant snake battle skills. Most of the time he is a bumbling idiot, but given enough time he can pull out some other feelings that we saw in Meet the Parents. As for Williams, may he rest in peace, the man gave one brilliant performance despite his character being diluted from its previous glory. \n\nDislikes: A lot in this category for this reviewer. It starts with the adventure, which in the third installment has been diluted to a rushed set of sequences, hastily edited together to get out in time for Christmas. A shame since the tale had promise of suspense, timing, and mystery that could have tied so many things together. Instead, the story lacked any depth, quickly revealing the secret without so much a trial, a challenge, or even an argument, it was just handed right to them and a rather lame story as well. In addition, a lot of the suspense was missing in this film, with only an irregular decay in the tablet's magic threatening our heroes. Speaking of which the cavalcade also lost their spunk, the strong willed character reduced to comedic boobs, some of which hardly utter a line, as Ben Stiller takes center stage. Such a shame indeed, but your kids will get a kick out of the simplistic journey, that is if they can sit in there seats  which some chose not to. \n\nInstead the adventure was put aside for  comedy, or what passed for it in this movie. Yes there were a few zingers at first, but they quickly were lost to stupid rants of ridiculous arguing with his caveman doppleganger, stupid exchange of words with exhibits, and some rather awkward discussions with Rebel Wilson. Sure it happens once or twice I can handle it, but it just kept happening, even at the big, exciting climax, with the lame bad guy. Why can these films not realize the limits of tired jokes? I can't answer it either, but sadly it took away from the movie. Perhaps this comedy was the reason why the characters were also a shell of their former glory, and why they were pretty much background characters with the new exhibits. Even the normally cute dynamic between father and son was bad, Hollywood choosing to make the son another lame teenager like most movies do. Is it accurate? Probably, but in a movie with magical tablets you would think a little magic could spread to the humans as well. \n\nI'm not going to lie, this movie failed me on many levels, and disappointed me for the grand conclusion. Still, it is a cute film that kids will handle, and still holds a little of the spark that got me into the series. Worth a trip to the theater? Not really, but if you wish to pay homage to a few of the stars I wouldn't blame you. My scores for this film are: \n\nAdventure/Comedy/Family: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114583,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2014-12-17","keywords":"night watchman,museum of natural history manhattan new york city,star died before release,museum,tablet","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4060720921","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzEzMzcwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAxMzI0MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzEzMzcwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAxMzI0MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Larry leaves New York City for London, where he unites favorite and new characters while embarking on a quest to save the magic before it is gone forever."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158853/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295296/","name":"Mark Friedman"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The effects are fluid, the designs beautiful, and when actually integrated into the movie, more on that later, you get the fun feeling you got in the first movie. Unfortunately most of these objects are background, aimlessly wandering around the scene while the big boys come out to play. \n\nOutside of the special effects there are some fun pokes at human society's obsessions, especially at internet videos, pop culture, and of course ridiculous habits that celebrities have. Some of these jokes are well timed, often delivered in a manner that is quite funny. However, many of the jokes, as happens most of the time, lose their charm and the lack of any witty humor makes it pretty much just mindless rambling that kids will only enjoy. Oh sure it's cute, but Hollywood needs to learn that more isn't necessary funnier, in fact it's the opposite. However, audiences allow them to get away with it, so what is the use in complaining. \n\nNow past funny, this Night at the Museum has another emotional side to it, helping to teach the moral lesson of moving on in the magical theatrical way. With the use of orchestrated symphony work, well angled camera shots, decent writing, and of course great acting, I'll admit I got that tingly feeling all over. No it's not gas, but those looking for a life lesson reminder will get it in this film, and a decent closing to the series  I think. As for acting, well Stiller gets the most screen time on this one. The verdict, it's alright  when he's not acting like a buffoon, and the man has some surprising agility and giant snake battle skills. Most of the time he is a bumbling idiot, but given enough time he can pull out some other feelings that we saw in Meet the Parents. As for Williams, may he rest in peace, the man gave one brilliant performance despite his character being diluted from its previous glory. \n\nDislikes: A lot in this category for this reviewer. It starts with the adventure, which in the third installment has been diluted to a rushed set of sequences, hastily edited together to get out in time for Christmas. A shame since the tale had promise of suspense, timing, and mystery that could have tied so many things together. Instead, the story lacked any depth, quickly revealing the secret without so much a trial, a challenge, or even an argument, it was just handed right to them and a rather lame story as well. In addition, a lot of the suspense was missing in this film, with only an irregular decay in the tablet's magic threatening our heroes. Speaking of which the cavalcade also lost their spunk, the strong willed character reduced to comedic boobs, some of which hardly utter a line, as Ben Stiller takes center stage. Such a shame indeed, but your kids will get a kick out of the simplistic journey, that is if they can sit in there seats  which some chose not to. \n\nInstead the adventure was put aside for  comedy, or what passed for it in this movie. Yes there were a few zingers at first, but they quickly were lost to stupid rants of ridiculous arguing with his caveman doppleganger, stupid exchange of words with exhibits, and some rather awkward discussions with Rebel Wilson. Sure it happens once or twice I can handle it, but it just kept happening, even at the big, exciting climax, with the lame bad guy. Why can these films not realize the limits of tired jokes? I can't answer it either, but sadly it took away from the movie. Perhaps this comedy was the reason why the characters were also a shell of their former glory, and why they were pretty much background characters with the new exhibits. Even the normally cute dynamic between father and son was bad, Hollywood choosing to make the son another lame teenager like most movies do. Is it accurate? Probably, but in a movie with magical tablets you would think a little magic could spread to the humans as well. \n\nI'm not going to lie, this movie failed me on many levels, and disappointed me for the grand conclusion. Still, it is a cute film that kids will handle, and still holds a little of the spark that got me into the series. Worth a trip to the theater? Not really, but if you wish to pay homage to a few of the stars I wouldn't blame you. My scores for this film are: \n\nAdventure/Comedy/Family: 7.0 Movie Overall: 6.0","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":114583,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2014-12-17","keywords":"night watchman,museum of natural history manhattan new york city,star died before release,museum,tablet","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4060720921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzEzMzcwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAxMzI0MzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ2NzEzMzcwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAxMzI0MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Larry leaves New York City for London, where he unites favorite and new characters while embarking on a quest to save the magic before it is gone forever.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001774/","name":"Ben Stiller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000245/","name":"Robin Williams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0506613/","name":"Shawn Levy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0158853/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0295296/","name":"Mark Friedman"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Wyspa, która leży na Oceanie Indyjskim, przy wschodnim wybrzeżu Afryki, fascynuje nie tylko bogactwem flory, ale też niezwykłymi endemicznymi gatunkami zwierząt. Niestety, okazuje się, że nie ma ona nic wspólnego z rajem. Autorzy dwuczęściowego dokumentu pokazują, jak szybko człowiek ze swoją gospodarką doprowadza do zniszczenia tamtejszej przyrody, m.in. sporych połaci lasów deszczowych.</desc>

However the financials are way out of whack and ruins any true insight. The wandering path is done adequately enough but it feels half finished and leaves an unsatisfied feeling at the completion. Maybe it's just me, but if you're going to make a movie about preaching the dangers of drugs and wanting people to change I think you need to put an effort into making a good film.

Seduced by the money, but troubled by the hypocrisy, Utah must decide between what will make him rich, and what will save Opal.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12333318/","name":"Suzanne Wind","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342029/","name":"Frank Grillo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2129444/","name":"Alice Englert"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6461537/","name":"John Swab"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0320829/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0586673/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0474730/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6461537/","name":"John Swab"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The, relative innocence of Christian Dawkins?\n\nDespite not focusing on any given topic, the overall sensation is that The Scheme is lacking in a prerequisite for documentaries - objectivity.\n\nWhy take the viewpoint that Dawkins, who is obviously knee deep in a crooked system, should be the chosen voice to criticise said system?\n\nThere is an element of truth in the fact that he got hard done by in relation to his involvement - but a nuance of raw deal hardly makes for a great documentary.\n\nIf you're looking to criticise the system - do so. If you're using Dawkins to demonstrate a miscarriage of justice - there are thousands more deserving.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":784,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary","Crime"],"datePublished":"2020-03-31","keywords":"ncaa,professional basketball,hustler,bribery,fbi investigation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11465806/","name":"Christian Dawkins","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11465807/","name":"Sean Miller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11465808/","name":"Will Wade"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2897692/","name":"Pat Kondelis"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0462903/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008693/"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

He is an underrated talent most likely due to his lack of a prolific career, somewhat like director Terrence Malick. Here, Day-Lewis teams up with one of Hollywood's most prolific men, Steven Spielberg, who is coming off a stellar 2011, where he produced both Super 8 and Transformers: Dark of the Moon and directed both The Adventures of Tintin and War Horse, two acclaimed pictures.\n\nSpielberg mans the camera in one of the most exhilarating biopics in recent memory. Lincoln is a stunning humanization and coloring-book job of American politics, shedding a light on the skepticism and grayness of the government during that time. To simplify the story, Spielberg chooses to focus on the political interworkings of our sixteenth president's cabinet rather than the Civil War itself. It shows the long, grating process of amending the United States' constitution for the thirteenth time to abolish slavery and grant African Americans equality, and how that more than one men stood at the center of the action when the process was taking place, along with how he was incorruptibly confident that ending the practice of slavery will lead to ending the war.\n\nWhile titled "Lincoln," we get several other characters with a fairly surprising amount of screen time. Among them are Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing Lincoln's oldest son, Robert Todd, Tommy Lee Jones playing Thaddeus Stevens, the fiery Radical Republican leader who is strongly passionate about abolitionism, Sally Field as the president's devoted wife, Mary Todd, and David Strathairn as William Seward, the secretary of state. It could also be said that at times Abraham Lincoln is not writer Tony Kushner's (who also penned Spielberg's Munich, unseen by me) prime focus, as much as it is the backroom deals of the 1865 congress and the political battles and obstacles each member faced when their morals and ideology came forth in abolishing one of the most inhumane acts ever allowed in the United States.\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis is mesmerizing here, never overplaying or shortchanging Lincoln in one of his most reliable roles yet. Here, he seems much more cinematic than his previous works, and seems to be smitten with Lincoln's character and persona as he embodies him for one-hundred and fifty minutes. His voice is not stereotypically deep manly, and guttural as many other works have made him out to be, but reedy and poetically satisfying, boasting not much more than historical records claim. Day-Lewis is only assisted by the wealth of invaluable talent he is surrounded by, yet some of the most powerful work of his career comes out when Lincoln is reciting stories or parables to a group of bewildered, yet fascinated individuals who recall and cherish every word the man is saying.\n\nOne requirement upon seeing Lincoln is you must commit to two and a half hours of dialog and monologues from several characters about several different topics. One challenge faced by the filmmakers that is inherently difficult to overcome is the wealth of information, history, and knowledge of the period, and we see the struggle they face at attempting to sum it all up into a structured, disciplined film. I could've seen this as an HBO ten to fifteen part miniseries, elaborating on smaller characters, extending the work of the amendment, and even showing Lincoln's impact on a still vulnerable United States. But such an action may have proved too heavy for even history buffs.\n\nWith this film, there is a lot going on in terms of subtleties and there is a plethora of weight that rests on the film's script that at times makes this a challenging picture to watch. I'm reminded of my recent adventure to see the Wachowski's Cloud Atlas, and how that film was beautiful, striking, and increasingly ambitious, but also maddening and occasionally tedious. I wouldn't so much call Lincoln maddening or tedious as I would challenging to stay in-tuned with.\n\nBut that does not mean I couldn't see thousands of people emerging pleased and delighted with the film they just saw. This is a richly detailed and unsurprisingly intellectual picture that will go down as one of the greatest cinematic endeavors to ever focus on American politics. Kushner and Spielberg have gone on to make quite possibly the best film we'll ever see about the passage of an amendment through congress and the exhausting compromises and deals that go along with the process. Finally, I must note Spielberg's top notch use of subversive elements from Lincoln's voice, to the focus of the picture from a narrative point of view, to the inevitable conclusion that still leaves us impacted and shaken.\n\nStarring: Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, David Strathairn, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, James Spader, Hal Holbrook, Tommy Lee Jones, and Jackie Earle Haley.

In one scene, Glen Close's character thinks aloud about writing a book about the French and their strange ways, as if she were a Christian missionary or Imperialist, wanting to chronicle the quaint ways of the 'natives'. In another scene on a train someone asks "Is this the Middle Ages?", with the reply being, "No, this is France". Since Americans in general seem so intimidated by European culture and intelligence they feel they must deride all native Europeans in such a manner. \n\n Naomi Watts, someone whom I admire greatly, was so uninteresting and morose that I was glad whenever she left a scene.

It's as if the filmmakers seem to think that only Americans know what is truly right and wrong and everyone else is either backwards or dumb. \n\nThe American attitude to other cultures is so condescending that one feels physically sick. In one scene, Glen Close's character thinks aloud about writing a book about the French and their strange ways, as if she were a Christian missionary or Imperialist, wanting to chronicle the quaint ways of the 'natives'. In another scene on a train someone asks "Is this the Middle Ages?", with the reply being, "No, this is France". Since Americans in general seem so intimidated by European culture and intelligence they feel they must deride all native Europeans in such a manner. \n\n Naomi Watts, someone whom I admire greatly, was so uninteresting and morose that I was glad whenever she left a scene. Whenever someone voiced an opinion or idea that was not 'hip-PC' then her character would grumble.\n\n'Le Divorce' was tough going, it wasn't entertaining in any way, nor is it a film I would recommend to anyone else.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11339,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-08-29","keywords":"american,french,love,sex,france","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Le Divorce","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1636958489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODIxZDhmOTUtZDE5OS00M2RlLWJkM2ItYjQxMjE2YWE0MjE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODIxZDhmOTUtZDE5OS00M2RlLWJkM2ItYjQxMjE2YWE0MjE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pre","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005028/","name":"Kate Hudson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000330/","name":"Stockard Channing"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412465/","name":"James Ivory"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055367/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424956/","name":"Diane Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0695609/","name":"Ruth Prawer Jhabvala","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0412465/","name":"James Ivory"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

At last a straight up movie not relying on any gimmicks!\n\nRobin Hood delivers what it promises. Solid action, good narrative, and the inclusion of a bit of history with action between England and France gives the movie an added meat and almost realistic feel to it. The dialogue is a bit ropey at times, and Robin's "merry men" could have had a bit more screen time, but otherwise i see no major fault with this movie.\n\nAll in all a refreshing, exciting, fun, entertaining, nothing that you wouldn't expect from the pairing of Russel Crowe and Ridley Scott.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261207,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2010-05-12","keywords":"archer,robin hood character,england,1190s,king of england","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Robin Hood: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi73860121","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3ODEzMjMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU4MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY3ODEzMjMxMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDU4MzczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of an archer in the army of Richard Coeur de Lion who fights against the Norman invaders and becomes the legendary hero known as Robin Hood.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000128/","name":"Russell Crowe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000949/","name":"Cate Blanchett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532193/","name":"Matthew Macfadyen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000631/","name":"Ridley Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001338/","name":"Brian Helgeland","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0717550/","name":"Ethan Reiff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0903456/","name":"Cyrus Voris"],"duration":"PT2H20M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Rather than getting into the usual annoyances and uneasy relationships common with family in law, or old bones to pick between brothers and sisters, the weekend starts unproblematic. Plans have been made previously for a do-it-yourself form of euthanasia, which is illegal almost everywhere. Yet we learn that everyone involved has accepted the procedure. The timing is such that the mother can take the pills by herself, without help, something not possible anymore when her illness worsens, the latter due in 1 or 2 months. Her husband can say that she did it all by herself while he took a walk, particularly important as a precaution because as a doctor he certainly cannot be suspected of any active involvement in such a procedure.\n\nThe group of relatives assembled for the weekend in question is well chosen, from a plot perspective, with very diverse characters and attitudes, albeit that there are not so many family members that we lose track on the respective opinions and motives.

Now that she has more time on her hands, she welcomes the opportunity to renew the relationship with her mother, and to discuss matters of mutual interest. This is something that I can understand fully, as having similar ideas myself over having not spent sufficient time with my parents, in spite of them devoting ample time to me when I was young. A second argument of the daughter is that doctors can be wrong in their predictions, in other words that the planned euthanasia is much too soon, and that medicine can be invented in the meantime to prolong her life for many years to come. All this is just an example of aforementioned turns of events, everything just rational and understandable, yet endangering the plans that were so well thought through.\n\nIt is an achievement in itself that it all happened on screen within 97 minutes, in a limited time span in which not a second was wasted, letting events pass by in a logical order and evenly spread over time.

I haven't watched any Swiss film before, at least to my knowledge?\n\nIt's absolutely amazing. The acting from both Sarah Spale and Luna Mwezi is sublime and extremely believable. At times it's really hard to get through, since the story revolving around Mia and her mom is very sad and somewhat depressing. The daily struggle of the daughter Mia, trying to help her mother, is very touching, although very sad.\n\nI had to stop the movie a few times, just to get a break. Definitely cried through a lot of the tough scenes. I had to remind myself it's "just" a movie, but it felt very real.\n\nAnyways, if you get a chance to watch this movie - I thoroughly recommend you should.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":641,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-11-18","keywords":"mother daughter relationship,coming of age,drug addicted woman","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Platzspitzbaby","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1005371161","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRkYzQyZTEtM2Y4My00MTg3LWI4MWItNWVkNGQ3YWQzNzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRkYzQyZTEtM2Y4My00MTg3LWI4MWItNWVkNGQ3YWQzNzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3768173/","name":"Jerry Hoffmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1282623/","name":"Sarah Spale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10457412/","name":"Luna Mwezi"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1301190/","name":"Pierre Monnard"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075448/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1825205/","name":"André Küttel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10457413/","name":"Michelle Halbheer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11979752/","name":"Franziska K.

Apparently only ONE other recommended this? This is one of the best movies I've watched in a long time. I stumbled upon this movie by chance, and decided to give it a try. It was very much worth it!! I haven't watched any Swiss film before, at least to my knowledge?\n\nIt's absolutely amazing. The acting from both Sarah Spale and Luna Mwezi is sublime and extremely believable. At times it's really hard to get through, since the story revolving around Mia and her mom is very sad and somewhat depressing. The daily struggle of the daughter Mia, trying to help her mother, is very touching, although very sad.\n\nI had to stop the movie a few times, just to get a break. Definitely cried through a lot of the tough scenes. I had to remind myself it's "just" a movie, but it felt very real.\n\nAnyways, if you get a chance to watch this movie - I thoroughly recommend you should.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":641,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-11-18","keywords":"mother daughter relationship,coming of age,drug addicted woman","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Platzspitzbaby","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1005371161","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRkYzQyZTEtM2Y4My00MTg3LWI4MWItNWVkNGQ3YWQzNzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjRkYzQyZTEtM2Y4My00MTg3LWI4MWItNWVkNGQ3YWQzNzUyXkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3768173/","name":"Jerry Hoffmann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1282623/","name":"Sarah Spale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10457412/","name":"Luna Mwezi"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1301190/","name":"Pierre Monnard"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0075448/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1825205/","name":"André Küttel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm10457413/","name":"Michelle Halbheer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11979752/","name":"Franziska K.

A battle of the sexes comedy that has sex appeal but no romance, Intolerable Cruelty is a film that reaches for the golden age of Hollywood but only touches the bronze.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":95179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Romance"],"datePublished":"2003-12-24","keywords":"woman wears eyeglasses,strong female character,lake tahoe,reference to henry viii,deception","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Intolerable Cruelty","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi781320473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmYzNTk4NGUtZDQ5My00MDEzLTlkZGMtNDU3MzE3MDQ0ZmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmYzNTk4NGUtZDQ5My00MDEzLTlkZGMtNDU3MzE3MDQ0ZmI2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001876/","name":"Catherine Zeta-Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000671/","name":"Billy Bob Thornton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003687/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049706/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0709070/","name":"Robert Ramsey","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0832043/","name":"Matthew Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0738908/","name":"John Romano"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

"The Danish Girl" is also in its way a film about torture, but more akin to the mental torture seen in films like "Buried" or "Flightpath". What must it be like to be trapped with a sexual orientation that you feel is not your own? To possess physical body parts you don't believe you should have? And all in a time (the 1920's) when an exposed ankle was considered slightly daring.\n\nBased on a true story, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne ("The Theory of Everything") and Alicia Vikander ("Ex Machina") play a bohemian married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. Einar is a renowned landscape artist with his wife a struggling portrait artist living in his shadow. After taking part in a cross-dressing modelling session, strong feelings are awakened in Einar. As a bit of a 'game' Gerda encourages him to explore the character of his alter-ego "Lili" further: a big mistake, as Einar is swept into a spiral of confusion and self-doubt.\n\nEddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar-nomination for his brave performance as Einar/Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect and delivering a truly heart-rending performance. With all this said however, I never quite believed I was watching the character of Lili but more Redmayne acting the character. Perhaps this is unfair, as Einar/Lili is such a bizarrely multi-dimensional person no one could perhaps have played him/her to my satisfaction. But I suspect (particularly as Redmayne won last year) this won't bring Redmayne the Oscar double. \n\nFar more impressive for me was the delicious and delightful Alicia Vikander, once more turning in a fantastic performance as the increasingly desperate (both psychologically and sexually) Gerda. With Rooney Mara, Vikander must be one of the brightest actress talents in today's cinema. \n\nAlso turning in a strong performance, in what is a very limited cast list, is Matthias Schoenaerts ("Far from the Madding Crowd") as a Parisian art dealer with a link to Einar's past. The omni-present (sorry, that should read "hard-working") Ben Whishaw turns up again as a party guest with an unhealthy interest in Lili and Sebastian Koch (most recently seen in series 5 of "Homeland") plays Dr Warnekros who is a pioneer in the new and risky business of sexual reassignment surgery.\n\nAnother star of the film is the luscious Danish capital, filmed in vibrant colours, as if from the artists' palettes, by Danny Cohen, a Hooper favourite. Also a big surprise to me was the gloriously photographed Danish countryside, seen at the end of the film, with mountains and seascapes I never knew existed.\n\nAnother Hooper alumni, Alexandre Desplat, supplies the soupy but very fitting score.\n\nWhile the film features a compelling story and much impressive acting, I never personally felt as connected to the story as I was to "The King's Speech". This isn't helped by a rather stagy script by Lucinda Coxon that feels lightweight at times. Perhaps its because we are in Oscar- season but, to me, it all felt a tad pretentious and (no pun intended) could have done with a few snips in places to reduce the running time by 15 minutes or so. That being said, and as an alternative view, I should point out that my wife was in tears for a good proportion of the film and disagrees vehemently with my views. I say "my wife", but since watching the film she's started wearing braces and smoking cigars – so I'm rather confused as to WHAT exactly is going on. :-)\n\n(For the graphical version of this review, see bob-the-movie-man.com.

"The Danish Girl" is also in its way a film about torture, but more akin to the mental torture seen in films like "Buried" or "Flightpath". What must it be like to be trapped with a sexual orientation that you feel is not your own? To possess physical body parts you don't believe you should have? And all in a time (the 1920's) when an exposed ankle was considered slightly daring.\n\nBased on a true story, Oscar-winner Eddie Redmayne ("The Theory of Everything") and Alicia Vikander ("Ex Machina") play a bohemian married couple Einar and Gerda Wegener, apparently happily married and trying for a child in 1920's Copenhagen. Einar is a renowned landscape artist with his wife a struggling portrait artist living in his shadow. After taking part in a cross-dressing modelling session, strong feelings are awakened in Einar. As a bit of a 'game' Gerda encourages him to explore the character of his alter-ego "Lili" further: a big mistake, as Einar is swept into a spiral of confusion and self-doubt.\n\nEddie Redmayne is surely up for another Oscar-nomination for his brave performance as Einar/Lili, using his expressive eyes to great effect and delivering a truly heart-rending performance. With all this said however, I never quite believed I was watching the character of Lili but more Redmayne acting the character. Perhaps this is unfair, as Einar/Lili is such a bizarrely multi-dimensional person no one could perhaps have played him/her to my satisfaction. But I suspect (particularly as Redmayne won last year) this won't bring Redmayne the Oscar double. \n\nFar more impressive for me was the delicious and delightful Alicia Vikander, once more turning in a fantastic performance as the increasingly desperate (both psychologically and sexually) Gerda. With Rooney Mara, Vikander must be one of the brightest actress talents in today's cinema. \n\nAlso turning in a strong performance, in what is a very limited cast list, is Matthias Schoenaerts ("Far from the Madding Crowd") as a Parisian art dealer with a link to Einar's past. The omni-present (sorry, that should read "hard-working") Ben Whishaw turns up again as a party guest with an unhealthy interest in Lili and Sebastian Koch (most recently seen in series 5 of "Homeland") plays Dr Warnekros who is a pioneer in the new and risky business of sexual reassignment surgery.\n\nAnother star of the film is the luscious Danish capital, filmed in vibrant colours, as if from the artists' palettes, by Danny Cohen, a Hooper favourite. Also a big surprise to me was the gloriously photographed Danish countryside, seen at the end of the film, with mountains and seascapes I never knew existed.\n\nAnother Hooper alumni, Alexandre Desplat, supplies the soupy but very fitting score.\n\nWhile the film features a compelling story and much impressive acting, I never personally felt as connected to the story as I was to "The King's Speech". This isn't helped by a rather stagy script by Lucinda Coxon that feels lightweight at times. Perhaps its because we are in Oscar- season but, to me, it all felt a tad pretentious and (no pun intended) could have done with a few snips in places to reduce the running time by 15 minutes or so. That being said, and as an alternative view, I should point out that my wife was in tears for a good proportion of the film and disagrees vehemently with my views. I say "my wife", but since watching the film she's started wearing braces and smoking cigars – so I'm rather confused as to WHAT exactly is going on. :-)\n\n(For the graphical version of this review, see bob-the-movie-man.com.

She has never lost a case and she is about to continue that winning streak with her latest case. When she meets her opposing counsel she has no reason to think that this scruffy man poses any threat to her. When he hands her her ass she steps up the competition and so begins a tense relationship in the courtroom. However outside of the court, the couple find a certain chemistry growing between them but surrounded by so many divorces and arguments how could anything good come of it?\n\nBilled as a big name romantic comedy in the mould of sparky screwball romances of the forties and fifties this comedy at times is great fun but at others falls terribly flat. Given what it was basing itself of it should be no surprise that the first half is the best with energetic duelling between the two leads. Later on the script has to deliver a believable romance out of this and here is where it really falters. It suddenly becomes this twinkly affair in Ireland where love blooms, although it doesn't really although it might. It is a difficult hurdle to get over and the film doesn't really manage it and the final third is deeply unconvincing and hard to care about as it mugs its way towards the inevitable conclusion. It is strange that McKenna's script is so slick when it is in the "banter" stage but so heavy with syrup and silly cliché towards the end, almost like all the talent was put into the first half, leaving nothing for the latter stages.\n\nBrosnan and Moore do try hard to make it work and mostly they succeed, but the material does gradually leave them out in the open. It helps that together they do manage an easy chemistry but later in the film they do struggle to convince with the more emotional side of the characters that exist outside of the fizz and snappy exchanges. Brosnan does well for the majority as he charms his way through but Moore can't seem to slide between the film's levels  she works with the snappy comedy stuff but when the emotional stuff comes she seems to drift between rom-com level acting and trying to go deeper. Support from Sheen, Posey, Fisher and a few others add some limited value around the edges but none can stop the script falling apart the longer it goes on.\n\nOverall then what starts as a reasonable hark back to screwball romances gradually turns into an unconvincing, silly and sentimental affair that not even the big name stars can keep above the water. Not really worth a look for that reason."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22964,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-09-29","keywords":"neo screwball comedy,workplace romance,coworker relationship,using others,love","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Laws of Attraction","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2744451353","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYwNGRlNDQtNzljNS00ZGE5LWI5NWEtZjE0NGM3YTVmNDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYwNGRlNDQtNzljNS00ZGE5LWI5NWEtZjE0NGM3YTVmNDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from New Line Cinema"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000205/","name":"Parker Posey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0398185/","name":"Peter Howitt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054516/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088199/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011877/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0112459/","name":"Aline Brosh McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0363326/","name":"Robert Harling"}],"duration":"PT1H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Amidst a sea of litigation, two New York City divorce lawyers find love." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0323033/","name":"Laws of Attraction","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEzODg4MjM1NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNzQzNTI3._V1_.jpg","description":"Amidst a sea of litigation, two New York City divorce lawyers find love.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0323033/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"bob the moo","dateCreated":"2006-12-28","inLanguage":"English","name":"Starts well but gradually gets more unconvincing, slushy and annoying as it goes on","reviewBody":"Audrey Woods is one of the best, nay, THE best divorce attorney in town. She has never lost a case and she is about to continue that winning streak with her latest case. When she meets her opposing counsel she has no reason to think that this scruffy man poses any threat to her. When he hands her her ass she steps up the competition and so begins a tense relationship in the courtroom. However outside of the court, the couple find a certain chemistry growing between them but surrounded by so many divorces and arguments how could anything good come of it?\n\nBilled as a big name romantic comedy in the mould of sparky screwball romances of the forties and fifties this comedy at times is great fun but at others falls terribly flat. Given what it was basing itself of it should be no surprise that the first half is the best with energetic duelling between the two leads. Later on the script has to deliver a believable romance out of this and here is where it really falters. It suddenly becomes this twinkly affair in Ireland where love blooms, although it doesn't really although it might. It is a difficult hurdle to get over and the film doesn't really manage it and the final third is deeply unconvincing and hard to care about as it mugs its way towards the inevitable conclusion. It is strange that McKenna's script is so slick when it is in the "banter" stage but so heavy with syrup and silly cliché towards the end, almost like all the talent was put into the first half, leaving nothing for the latter stages.\n\nBrosnan and Moore do try hard to make it work and mostly they succeed, but the material does gradually leave them out in the open. It helps that together they do manage an easy chemistry but later in the film they do struggle to convince with the more emotional side of the characters that exist outside of the fizz and snappy exchanges. Brosnan does well for the majority as he charms his way through but Moore can't seem to slide between the film's levels  she works with the snappy comedy stuff but when the emotional stuff comes she seems to drift between rom-com level acting and trying to go deeper. Support from Sheen, Posey, Fisher and a few others add some limited value around the edges but none can stop the script falling apart the longer it goes on.\n\nOverall then what starts as a reasonable hark back to screwball romances gradually turns into an unconvincing, silly and sentimental affair that not even the big name stars can keep above the water. Not really worth a look for that reason.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":22964,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2004-09-29","keywords":"neo screwball comedy,workplace romance,coworker relationship,using others,love","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Laws of Attraction","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2744451353","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYwNGRlNDQtNzljNS00ZGE5LWI5NWEtZjE0NGM3YTVmNDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODYwNGRlNDQtNzljNS00ZGE5LWI5NWEtZjE0NGM3YTVmNDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from New Line Cinema","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000194/","name":"Julianne Moore","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000205/","name":"Parker Posey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0398185/","name":"Peter Howitt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054516/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088199/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0011877/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0112459/","name":"Aline Brosh McKenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0363326/","name":"Robert Harling"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In 'Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban', the trio are now thirteen and beginning their Third Year at Hogwarts, under the fear of an escaped criminal who played a part in the deaths of Harry's parents and seems to be stalking the school, preying on Harry.\n\nThe child acting in this film has improved slightly with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint probably faring the best in comparison to their young co-stars. Although he is lumbered with a Ron who has once again been reduced to a comic character, it's a sign of Grint's abilities that he does well without looking embarrassed or too clownish. Dan Radcliffe was still very poor, obviously struggling to portray Harry's darker emotions in a manner that isn't wooden and awkward and and this was very apparent in the scene where he makes an atrocious effort to cry when he finds out his godfather had betrayed his parents to their deaths. while Tom Felton was let down by poor scripting of Draco.\n\nThe adult cast were excellent. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were perfectly cast. Lupin was soft yet stern when needed and you could feel there was a parental rapport between him and Harry, and I couldn't imagine anyone other than David Thewlis in the role. And Gary Oldman was great in depicting Black's determination, mingled with an hysterical madness due to his incarceration in the hellish wizarding prison Azkaban. As for Michael Gambon, who was recast in the role of Dumbledore, I felt he was an improvement. Richard Harris was a gifted actor but his Dumbledore had a cold, aloofness to him whereas Gambon was able to portray the warm, eccentricity of the character without diminishing the power and wisdom of Dumbledore. And the rest of the regular cast, such as Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith, were perfect although we expect no better from them now!\n\nOne of the best aspects of this film is how it no longer pandered to kiddies like the previous two films did. There was a darker, moodier edge to the story and the characters. The wizarding world no longer seemed like a perfect haven and the characters had grown beyond being innocent children; this reflected the book itself since many feel PoA was a turning point in the series where it finally felt like Harry Potter- boy and book- were growing up. The Hogwarts' setting differed from the previous films yet not only was it definitely more faithful to the books but finally it felt as if the castle was in Scotland rather than perpetually sunny Disney Land and this enhanced the mood being set in the film. The clock was a nice touch, linking to the theme of time in the actual storyline, as was the bridge in being a place for Harry to mull over his problems. Also, in many ways, this film could have ended up a muddled mess in regards to the ending but Cuaron handled the Time Turner scenes well.\n\nHowever, there were flaws to the film, which let it down. The characters of Hermione and Draco were poorly scripted so they seemed like two completely different characters from the ones we know and love in the books. Although Watson as an actress has improved since CoS, the main problem with the script is that Hermione is being portrayed as being too cool and cocky compared to the bookworm who has no interest in fashion that we know Hermione to be in the books. Steve Kloves, the scriptwriter who admits he's responsible for the change, really needs to learn heroines don't need to be cool Buffy types to be admired; part of why Hermione is so popular as a character in the books is that she appeals to girls who are bookish themselves and easily identify with her. And as for Draco, he comes across as too much of a cowardly, weak girlie-boy rather than an insidious, vicious brat who can be a threat to Harry when he chooses to. \n\nAlso, there was no telling of what Black did to Snape in school that left him so bitter in his hatred and I wished they'd included the scene where he let slip what Lupin was, especially as this animosity between him, Black and Lupin plays a larger role as the books go on. And speaking of Lupin, the werewolf CGI was atrocious. He looked like an emaciated rat rather than the wolf-like creature who leaves even the more powerful wizards quivering in fear. I wished there was more in the ending too as I would have loved to see Vernon's face when he found out who Black was. Kloves needs to learn how to round the Harry Potter films off properly as this was also a sticking point in CoS.\n\nAt the end of the day, there were scenes left out, some of which we didn't mind skipping but others (an explanation to Harry of James Potter's friendship to Black and Lupin) were sorely missed. It was a great film but it could have done with being made longer or skipping on non-essential scenes (less of the Knight Bus and Hermione punching Malfoy in a manner that makes her out to be a thug) to make way for scenes which are more important. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting something along the lines of RotK but it's still great viewing. I'd give it a seven-and-a-half out of ten with the hopes Cuaron will return to the helm again although preferably not with Kloves as the scriptwriter. I think Cuaron would be excellent working with a script produced by someone who has a better handle on the darker aspects of the books and a deeper understanding of the HP characters.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":585447,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-06-03","keywords":"magic,wizard,werewolf,rat,school of magic","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007761177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

In 'Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban', the trio are now thirteen and beginning their Third Year at Hogwarts, under the fear of an escaped criminal who played a part in the deaths of Harry's parents and seems to be stalking the school, preying on Harry.\n\nThe child acting in this film has improved slightly with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint probably faring the best in comparison to their young co-stars. Although he is lumbered with a Ron who has once again been reduced to a comic character, it's a sign of Grint's abilities that he does well without looking embarrassed or too clownish. Dan Radcliffe was still very poor, obviously struggling to portray Harry's darker emotions in a manner that isn't wooden and awkward and and this was very apparent in the scene where he makes an atrocious effort to cry when he finds out his godfather had betrayed his parents to their deaths. while Tom Felton was let down by poor scripting of Draco.\n\nThe adult cast were excellent. Remus Lupin and Sirius Black were perfectly cast. Lupin was soft yet stern when needed and you could feel there was a parental rapport between him and Harry, and I couldn't imagine anyone other than David Thewlis in the role. And Gary Oldman was great in depicting Black's determination, mingled with an hysterical madness due to his incarceration in the hellish wizarding prison Azkaban. As for Michael Gambon, who was recast in the role of Dumbledore, I felt he was an improvement. Richard Harris was a gifted actor but his Dumbledore had a cold, aloofness to him whereas Gambon was able to portray the warm, eccentricity of the character without diminishing the power and wisdom of Dumbledore. And the rest of the regular cast, such as Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith, were perfect although we expect no better from them now!\n\nOne of the best aspects of this film is how it no longer pandered to kiddies like the previous two films did. There was a darker, moodier edge to the story and the characters. The wizarding world no longer seemed like a perfect haven and the characters had grown beyond being innocent children; this reflected the book itself since many feel PoA was a turning point in the series where it finally felt like Harry Potter- boy and book- were growing up. The Hogwarts' setting differed from the previous films yet not only was it definitely more faithful to the books but finally it felt as if the castle was in Scotland rather than perpetually sunny Disney Land and this enhanced the mood being set in the film. The clock was a nice touch, linking to the theme of time in the actual storyline, as was the bridge in being a place for Harry to mull over his problems. Also, in many ways, this film could have ended up a muddled mess in regards to the ending but Cuaron handled the Time Turner scenes well.\n\nHowever, there were flaws to the film, which let it down. The characters of Hermione and Draco were poorly scripted so they seemed like two completely different characters from the ones we know and love in the books. Although Watson as an actress has improved since CoS, the main problem with the script is that Hermione is being portrayed as being too cool and cocky compared to the bookworm who has no interest in fashion that we know Hermione to be in the books. Steve Kloves, the scriptwriter who admits he's responsible for the change, really needs to learn heroines don't need to be cool Buffy types to be admired; part of why Hermione is so popular as a character in the books is that she appeals to girls who are bookish themselves and easily identify with her. And as for Draco, he comes across as too much of a cowardly, weak girlie-boy rather than an insidious, vicious brat who can be a threat to Harry when he chooses to. \n\nAlso, there was no telling of what Black did to Snape in school that left him so bitter in his hatred and I wished they'd included the scene where he let slip what Lupin was, especially as this animosity between him, Black and Lupin plays a larger role as the books go on. And speaking of Lupin, the werewolf CGI was atrocious. He looked like an emaciated rat rather than the wolf-like creature who leaves even the more powerful wizards quivering in fear. I wished there was more in the ending too as I would have loved to see Vernon's face when he found out who Black was. Kloves needs to learn how to round the Harry Potter films off properly as this was also a sticking point in CoS.\n\nAt the end of the day, there were scenes left out, some of which we didn't mind skipping but others (an explanation to Harry of James Potter's friendship to Black and Lupin) were sorely missed. It was a great film but it could have done with being made longer or skipping on non-essential scenes (less of the Knight Bus and Hermione punching Malfoy in a manner that makes her out to be a thug) to make way for scenes which are more important. I think I was disappointed because I was expecting something along the lines of RotK but it's still great viewing. I'd give it a seven-and-a-half out of ten with the hopes Cuaron will return to the helm again although preferably not with Kloves as the scriptwriter. I think Cuaron would be excellent working with a script produced by someone who has a better handle on the darker aspects of the books and a deeper understanding of the HP characters.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":585447,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2004-06-03","keywords":"magic,wizard,werewolf,rat,school of magic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2007761177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA4OTU3ZjctYTBmNi00MTk2LTlhZTgtZWQyMmM1MmI5NmQ1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0705356/","name":"Daniel Radcliffe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0914612/","name":"Emma Watson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0342488/","name":"Rupert Grint"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046151/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

This film in my opinion is the best Pixar film.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":984844,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2009-06-03","keywords":"heartfelt,balloon,talking dog,child in jeopardy,south america","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UP Â– UK Trailer ","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2557280793","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NTQ0MTM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDY1NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE4NTQ0MTM3M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDY1NDgyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"UP Â– UK Trailer ","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000799/","name":"Ed Asner","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2973712/","name":"Jordan Nagai","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001652/","name":"John Ratzenberger"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0677037/","name":"Bob Peterson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0677037/","name":"Bob Peterson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565336/","name":"Tom McCarthy"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Not one dry eye in the place, it had a great tempo and didn't drag on or have any lulls in the story. We were both very pleased and are still engaging in conversations about the movie. It's my opinion to highly recommend to everyone go out and watch a great movie and a heartfelt movie that redefines love in this time and age we live in. That is my two cents, hope you enjoy as much as we have.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":359208,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-05","keywords":"alcoholism,tinnitus,rising star,singer songwriter,singer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi94288665","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","description":"A movie star helps a young singer and actress find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605792/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The score tends to be monotonous and irritating but in spite of all that I intend to see "Atonement" again and I would recommend it with just the above mentioned reservations.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":265210,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-01-23","keywords":"world war two,rape,false accusation,sex,loss of virginity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Atonement","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3836805401","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjUwMzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM3ODM4._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTM1MjUwMzgwMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDM3ODM4._V1_.jpg","description":"Atonement trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0564215/","name":"James McAvoy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000950/","name":"Brenda Blethyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942504/","name":"Joe Wright"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0568605/","name":"Ian McEwan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0358960/","name":"Christopher Hampton"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is not better than GoldenEye but it is good decent action movie with great explosions, dangerous stunts and great action. Who is my favorite James Bond 007? That will definitely be Pierce Brosnan no one else, since his first film GoldenEye. I saw this movie as a fifteen year old teen I even have a poster at home from this movie. I love this movie I thought Roger Spottiswoode did a good job directing it. I thought it had decent stunts, decent action, less humor than Roger Moore. If you agree with me good, if you disagree with me that is your opinion. Tomorrow Never Dies is the 18th entry in the official James Bond film series.\n\nPierce Brosnan makes his second appearance as Agent 007, James Bond heads to stop a media mogul's plan to induce war between China and the UK in order to obtain exclusive global media coverage. \n\nI love the opening scene in which in Russia Bond steals airplane with military missals and weapons who are been sold to international terrorist and brings them home. We see Pierce Brosnan flying an airplane. In real life Pierce Brosnan was scared of that airplane he thought the crew will killed him. You have a beautiful explosions from those airplanes. In Hamburg, Germany Bond breaks into the headquarters of Carver's media company and finds the office occupied by Henry Gupta, Carver's communications specialist and known techno-terrorist. He is been chased from security guys, because Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh) makes entry and she touches the alarm. Bond is being fired by machine guns in which he flees great action sequences.\n\nBond drives a new car BMW 7 Series with a remote control on a cell phone Ericson. I miss those times in which we used Ericsson cell phone. In 2004 I had that phone for a year until it got broken and I had to buy a new phone. Bond with cell phone drives with his cell phone as a remotely without touching the steering wheel. I did read a complaint about this scene on IMDb that is not realistic and it shouldn't have been in this movie. Listen folks it is a fiction not realistic, it James Bond so who cares. I never mind that scene it was great action sequence in which Bond eluded his attackers and he drove his car off the wall ha ha.\n\nJames Bond and Wai Lin in Saigon, Vietnam jumped off the building in Carver's HQ. They escaped Carver's henchman and the flee off the building. They slide down Carver's poster while been handcuffed. Great action sequence in which Pierce Brosnan and Michele Yeoh drove handcuff on a motorcycle. That was incredible dangerous stunt. I read Michelle Yeoh did her own stunt on the motorcycle and it was really painful too sit on that bike her legs and body hurt her. Cars and helicopter chased them until they hanker the helicopter and it explodes. Practical effect real explosion no CGI or shaky cam real action. Bond in Vietnam that was interested story well done acted. \n\nBond on the ship a stealth craft that is invisible on the radar uses hand grenade and he actives with his watch the grenade explodes and he makes the ship visible on the radar. Bond kick's ass and he kill's on the end Carver. He throws Carver in to the sea drill excellent. Bond is fired with machine guns and he fires back killing several Carver's man.\n\nJonathan Pryce plays a good memorable villain, 'the emperor of the air,' Elliot Carver who was prepared to go to any length to increase the power of his media empire. If you think actor Jonathan Pryce did not a good job playing a bad guy. Watch him Ronin (1998) with Robert De Niro a year after this movie he played another bad guy.\n\nGötz Otto plays Stamper, the loyal psychopath henchman who follows Carver's orders murdering a group of shipwrecked British sailors. He was a good second bad guy but he wasn't memorable like Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp.\n\nJudi Dench is once again as M and she is more handsome and awesome than she was in GoldenEye. She is a good heart person in this movie I thought the actress did her job well. Samantha Bond, Joe Don Baker and Desmond Llewellyn - all reprise their "GoldenEye" roles.\n\nMichelle Yeoh did a good job as Wai Lin the new Bond girl she was awarded for the role of Wai Lin. A martial artist of considerable skills, she preferred to work alone - until she begins to trust 007.\n\nCarver's wife Paris was played by the great beauty, Teri Hatcher was excellent as Paris Carver's wife. She was good in her role and her performance. After an assassin kill's Carver's wife here we seen Bond's remorse and feelings, not a stone killer like Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace.\n\nTomorrow Never Dies (1997) is the eighteenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the second to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, with the screenplay written by Bruce Feirstein.\n\n10/10 Great Bond theme, it is my seventh favorite James Bond 007 movie in top ten favorite Bond films. I love this film to death and in my opinion it is way underrated.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":188805,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-12-12","keywords":"official james bond series,megalomaniac,media tycoon,world war three,ex boyfriend ex girlfriend relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What to Watch While You Wait for 'No Time to Die'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3602956569","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"If the wait for 'No Time to Die' feels endless, we have three titles to make the time go by, including a heist film where Daniel Craig delivers both the action and delightful puns, a classic Bond title where the women don't pull any punches, and a trippy miniseries from 'No Time to Die' director Cary Joji Fukunaga."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006854/","name":"Roger Spottiswoode"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270761/","name":"Bruce Feirstein"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I read Michelle Yeoh did her own stunt on the motorcycle and it was really painful too sit on that bike her legs and body hurt her. Cars and helicopter chased them until they hanker the helicopter and it explodes. Practical effect real explosion no CGI or shaky cam real action. Bond in Vietnam that was interested story well done acted. \n\nBond on the ship a stealth craft that is invisible on the radar uses hand grenade and he actives with his watch the grenade explodes and he makes the ship visible on the radar. Bond kick's ass and he kill's on the end Carver. He throws Carver in to the sea drill excellent. Bond is fired with machine guns and he fires back killing several Carver's man.\n\nJonathan Pryce plays a good memorable villain, 'the emperor of the air,' Elliot Carver who was prepared to go to any length to increase the power of his media empire. If you think actor Jonathan Pryce did not a good job playing a bad guy. Watch him Ronin (1998) with Robert De Niro a year after this movie he played another bad guy.\n\nGötz Otto plays Stamper, the loyal psychopath henchman who follows Carver's orders murdering a group of shipwrecked British sailors. He was a good second bad guy but he wasn't memorable like Famke Janssen as Xenia Onatopp.\n\nJudi Dench is once again as M and she is more handsome and awesome than she was in GoldenEye. She is a good heart person in this movie I thought the actress did her job well. Samantha Bond, Joe Don Baker and Desmond Llewellyn - all reprise their "GoldenEye" roles.\n\nMichelle Yeoh did a good job as Wai Lin the new Bond girl she was awarded for the role of Wai Lin. A martial artist of considerable skills, she preferred to work alone - until she begins to trust 007.\n\nCarver's wife Paris was played by the great beauty, Teri Hatcher was excellent as Paris Carver's wife. She was good in her role and her performance. After an assassin kill's Carver's wife here we seen Bond's remorse and feelings, not a stone killer like Daniel Craig in Quantum of Solace.\n\nTomorrow Never Dies (1997) is the eighteenth spy film in the James Bond series to be produced by Eon Productions, and the second to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Roger Spottiswoode, with the screenplay written by Bruce Feirstein.\n\n10/10 Great Bond theme, it is my seventh favorite James Bond 007 movie in top ten favorite Bond films. I love this film to death and in my opinion it is way underrated.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":188805,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1997-12-12","keywords":"official james bond series,megalomaniac,media tycoon,world war three,ex boyfriend ex girlfriend relationship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What to Watch While You Wait for 'No Time to Die'","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3602956569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYzZGFiMzQtMjlkYy00MmU4LTlmZjctZDVmOWRjYmExZGEwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWplZmZscA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"If the wait for 'No Time to Die' feels endless, we have three titles to make the time go by, including a heist film where Daniel Craig delivers both the action and delightful puns, a classic Bond title where the women don't pull any punches, and a trippy miniseries from 'No Time to Die' director Cary Joji Fukunaga.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000112/","name":"Pierce Brosnan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000596/","name":"Jonathan Pryce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0006854/","name":"Roger Spottiswoode"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270761/","name":"Bruce Feirstein","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I like the fact that they kept the original songs. Unlike a LOT of people in here, I did not mind the autotune because I didn't want to hear the voices of the actors if they were bad. Now people will complain about choosing a different cast then. The cast was final, end of story, get over it.

It isn't high art, but it's an entertaining film that will hold your attention to the end.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":308336,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Horror"],"datePublished":"2016-03-30","keywords":"bunker,kidnapping,alien,minimal cast,alien invasion","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2229122329","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIxMTU4NTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkxMTMwODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzIxMTU4NTMzM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkxMTMwODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Waking up from a car accident, a young woman finds herself in the basement of a man who says he's saved her life from a chemical attack that has left the outside uninhabitable.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000422/","name":"John Goodman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935541/","name":"Mary Elizabeth Winstead","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0302330/","name":"John Gallagher Jr."],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0870469/","name":"Dan Trachtenberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0021593/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045450/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1061091/","name":"Josh Campbell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1173295/","name":"Matthew Stuecken","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3227090/","name":"Damien Chazelle"],"duration":"PT1H43M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Now people will complain about choosing a different cast then. The cast was final, end of story, get over it. Also unlike a lot of people in here I am really glad they did not change the story from the original. Since it is a remake I don't expect a whole new story that would totally ruin the original.

I like the fact that they kept the original songs. Unlike a LOT of people in here, I did not mind the autotune because I didn't want to hear the voices of the actors if they were bad. Now people will complain about choosing a different cast then. The cast was final, end of story, get over it. Also unlike a lot of people in here I am really glad they did not change the story from the original. Since it is a remake I don't expect a whole new story that would totally ruin the original. Besides, with the money Disney has made, a 2nd one is definitely coming, you'll get your different story. The visuals were OK but could have been better especially Belle's village.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":290795,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-03-17","keywords":"beast,fairy tale,heroine,beast's heart,remake of oscar winner","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"For Your Consideration Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi179222553","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjg2NWY5NjgtMDRhNS00OTNiLWFkZjMtYWFhYWJkZGY1YWExXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTkxNjUyNQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As punishment for his actions, a young prince is transformed into a monstrous beast by a mysterious enchantress.

I would say I had pretty low knowledge in films before I first saw Inside Out (not to say that I'm highly intelligent on films now). I only saw about 200 films prior. I hadn't seen a lot of classic films or even know that film can be an art form just through its camera work among other aspects. So you could say that I can't speak for everyone on my views of this film. And you may be right because opinions are subjective anyway.\n\nThis is my favourite film ever.\n\nLike I said above, I didn't see a lot of films that were deemed as masterpieces at that time. While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nYet this is still my favourite film of all-time.\n\n80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.\n\nEver since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).\n\nInside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.\n\nIn the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.\n\nYou can vote "not helpful" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway. This is a beautiful film that will resonate in me always.\n\nI will never forget Inside Out.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":660021,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-17","keywords":"joy,sadness,anger,memory,running away","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Theaters: June 19","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi203730969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inside Out is in theaters on June 19!"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688132/","name":"Amy Poehler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352778/","name":"Bill Hader"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085400/","name":"Lewis Black"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498834/","name":"Meg LeFauve"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable.

But when Laura, a mutant child pursued by scientists, comes to him for help, he must get her to safety.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt3315342/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"trublu215","dateCreated":"2017-02-23","inLanguage":"English","name":"If there was ever a comic book movie deemed worthy of perfect, Logan is it.","reviewBody":"The word 'perfect' is very objective especially when it comes to film. While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":695874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"],"duration":"PT2H17M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman &amp; Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze "You're not sending me to the cooler", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear.

Adam West hammed it up in what has to be the campest yet enjoyable version of batman. It was cheesy, it had the POW, WHACK, KABOOM, very very tongue-in-cheek which, brings me to my next point, is what batman eventually became. Batman, featuring Michael Keaton was a good film, keaton was a good batman, he portrayed the dark knight to a whole new army of fans, a darker batman, less camp, plus with a villain such as Jack Nicholson (turning in another great performance) as the Joker it was win win. Where from there? A sequel, Keaton yet again, Batman Returns, not as good as its predecessor but still a thoroughly enjoyable film with the villains being Penguin (Devito) and Catwoman (Pfeiffer) adding something different to the batman series. All is going well, then things start to go sour. Keaton is gone and in comes Kilmer who has to be the most wooden Batman ever, in come the clichés, the tongue in cheek one-liners and so on but Batman still has some credibility until, dare I mention it, Batman &amp; Robin. This ruined the Batman series with Clooney just being the eye-candy for the ladies, the addition of Batgirl (oh dear Lord) and the villains just coming out with the most tongue-in-cheek one liners ever, example Mr Freeze "You're not sending me to the cooler", wrong, oh so wrong. Something had to be done and this was Batman Begins. This film rescues the Batman series single-handedly, it's a shame it didn't start off this way as it might not of died on it's rear. Bale is an inspired choice as Batman bringing a more serious side to Batman, the story is well paced, it's not all talk or just mind-numbing action, it actually keeps you gripped as you want to find more about Bruce Wayne's past. The only reason it misses out on a 10 is the quite pitiful bad guy scarecrow If you've not seen it I don't want to give too much away about the story but throw away all your perceptions about Batman because Batman is back and Batman has truly begun.

I walked out impressed and touched, surprised by how much I really enjoyed it, and wondering if other people would give it a chance and enjoy it, as well. Time will tell.\n\nThe things that I liked about this movie are easy to feel but not so easy to describe. There were moments that really got to me, bits of scenes that touched me and caught in my memory, and time and again I found myself nodding and smiling and thinking, "I know exactly how he feels," or "I remember that feeling." Somehow, this story was good in a different way than Garden State was good. I loved Garden State, and the plot of Elizabethtown is enough like Garden State that it was hard not to have it in mind when I sat down in the theatre, but the two movies are really quite different. Crowe's Elizabethtown felt more real than Braf's Garden State, and somewhat less contrived.\n\nElizabethtown is the kind of movie you should see on a sunny autumn afternoon after a walk with an old friend. It has a joy to it, a basic sense of optimism and a light touch, so that it never crossed the line from sadness into tragedy and melodrama. Crowe doesn't let us fall into sentiment, but he deftly weaves a story that could have been corny and sentimental in lesser hands. I read critics who said he let the music play the emotions for us, but I can't agree, because I think that the cast did an excellent job portraying people I could really feel for and with, especially Orlando Bloom.\n\nOrlando Bloom's Drew Baylor is introduced in a moment of pain and panic, utterly emotionally blocked, repeating "I'm fine" while feeling suicidal and saying "My condolences" to strangers and distant relatives as if the loss of his father belongs to them and not to him. In the film, he relaxes and grows emotionally under the tutelage of Kirsten Dunst's Claire, and together they work their way through the American heartland into a tender relationship and a new perspective on the meaning and value of life and success. His American accent and her Southern drawl might both be a little off at times, but it was easy to forgive in the interest of watching what happened next.\n\nFrom the side stories of the secondary characters (Susan Sarandon is delightful, as always, in a turn as a widow whose reaction to her husband's death is to reach out and grab life with both hands) to the road trip into Americana, all the quirky little moments that felt real and sincere made this movie one that I enjoyed watching and will think about and remember.

Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.\n\nNot everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.\n\nFarming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous.

Unlike many apocalyptic sci-fi films that feature advanced technology as the source of our destruction (ala The Terminator movies), it instead asserts that technology will save us.\n\nNot everyone in Interstellar recognizes the potential of advanced technology. Most dismiss it as a waste of time and resources, and not just old curmudgeons feel this way. Thoughtful, intelligent young characters share this sentiment. This belief gained steam following a world-wide blight that wiped out the vast majority of life on earth—crops and humans.\n\nFarming became paramount while advanced technology was deemed frivolous.

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-23","keywords":"computer,father daughter relationship,apple computer,dialogue driven,1990s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424367385","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career -- beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 -- Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410596/","name":"Walter Isaacson"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to paint a portrait of the man at its epicenter. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt2080374/","name":"Steve Jobs","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE0NTA2MTEwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzg4NzU2NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution, to paint a portrait of the man at its epicenter. The story unfolds backstage at three iconic product launches, ending in 1998 with the unveiling of the iMac.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt2080374/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"AlsExGal","dateCreated":"2017-07-08","inLanguage":"English","name":"an abstract portrait of the man..","reviewBody":"... in that you can argue about almost every stroke in the painting, yet when you stand back a few feet from the work, you realize that this is a more accurate portrayal of Steve Jobs than any photograph could be.\n\nFor example, Michael Fassbender looks nothing like Steve Jobs did at any point in his adult life, sounds nothing like Steve Jobs did. Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why? Because every incident portrayed sounds EXACTLY like something Steve Jobs would have done or said even if the entire incident never happened.\n\nKate Winsett gave an Oscar worthy performance as Joanna Hoffman, Jobs' marketing expertise and confidante, if he had any confidante at all. She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-23","keywords":"computer,father daughter relationship,apple computer,dialogue driven,1990s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424367385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career -- beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 -- Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410596/","name":"Walter Isaacson"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This film was made to look cool, sound cool, and define cool. Yeah, okay, the MiG-28s are really F-5 Tigers; I've read the 'goofs' section before. And Tom Cruise's height. And about 'Maverick going supersonic - I'll be there in 30 seconds,' and the laws of physics preventing him from covering 200 or so miles from the carrier in that time. Whatever! So what! If Top Gun had tried to be accurate and true-to-life in every respect, it would have been some oh-so-serious flick like Courage Under Fire. Here's some examples of what I mean:\n\n1 - what's the best way to evade cannon fire? Do a snazzy barrel roll. Problem solved!\n\n2 - the MiG pilots have tinted visors. The good guys don't. Go figure.\n\n2.5 - Russian planes are actually grey or green. The MiG 28s are black. The Tomcats are... yeah, you guessed it... white! Good vs. Evil.\n\n3 - Modern air-to-air combat is usually fought at distances of tens of miles between aircraft. Top Gun uses much cooler spitting-distance WWI era tactics.\n\n4 - "It's too close for missiles. I'm switching to guns!" Enough said.\n\n5 - the generic guy carrying coffee who gets knocked over by the fuming air-control officer. We never see him get up. Classic.\n\n6 - even the edited TV version is a few steps above normal-cool. "... you'll be flying a cargo plane [edit]... out of Hong Kong!"\n\n7 - the way Iceman says, "Mayday, Mav's in trouble.

This film was made to look cool, sound cool, and define cool. Yeah, okay, the MiG-28s are really F-5 Tigers; I've read the 'goofs' section before. And Tom Cruise's height. And about 'Maverick going supersonic - I'll be there in 30 seconds,' and the laws of physics preventing him from covering 200 or so miles from the carrier in that time. Whatever! So what! If Top Gun had tried to be accurate and true-to-life in every respect, it would have been some oh-so-serious flick like Courage Under Fire. Here's some examples of what I mean:\n\n1 - what's the best way to evade cannon fire? Do a snazzy barrel roll. Problem solved!\n\n2 - the MiG pilots have tinted visors. The good guys don't. Go figure.\n\n2.5 - Russian planes are actually grey or green. The MiG 28s are black. The Tomcats are... yeah, you guessed it... white! Good vs. Evil.\n\n3 - Modern air-to-air combat is usually fought at distances of tens of miles between aircraft. Top Gun uses much cooler spitting-distance WWI era tactics.\n\n4 - "It's too close for missiles. I'm switching to guns!" Enough said.\n\n5 - the generic guy carrying coffee who gets knocked over by the fuming air-control officer. We never see him get up. Classic.\n\n6 - even the edited TV version is a few steps above normal-cool. "... you'll be flying a cargo plane [edit]... out of Hong Kong!"\n\n7 - the way Iceman says, "Mayday, Mav's in trouble. He's in a flat spin, and heading out to sea."\n\n8 - the graceful way Top Gun maintained a PG rating, without using the F-word once.\n\nTop Gun came out in 1986. That's 1986. Seventeen years ago.

When you're down and out, the best shot is, simply, to   Go for it!","reviewBody":"When a doctor or a family member tells you that the only life you have ever know is over, that can be a pretty bitter pill too swallow. In Rocky V, Rocky Balboa is faced with such a scenario. This movie proves to me that you need to have more than one string to your arrow, as you never know when it might come in handy one day. Rocky V also points out that money and possession are not the important things in life, but family and (true) friends are!\n\nLosing it all does not mean a thing unless you've got something to lose  And Rocky Balboa had it all. Times have changed, though, for former Heavyweight champion of the world. A lifetime of fighting has taken its toll, mentally and physically, and the maneuverings of an scrupulous accountant have left him financially strapped. But resiliency and the ability to come back have been trademarks of the Rocky legend. Just when it looks like the champ is down for the count, he discovers the raw talent of a young fighter named Tommy Gunn, who just might be Rocky's last chance for glory. In a world where achievement is marked by dollars and cents, and in a profession where success is measured in wins and losses, Rocky Balboa knows that, whatever the struggle, your only hope is to give it your best shot.\n\n This film is probably the weakest of the five films in the Rocky series. Yet there are some very good parts to it. The way we see Rocky get over bankruptcy was very good, as is the way he eventually makes his family the most important thing in his life. Again I found this story to be good, though I guess it lacked that real Rocky feel to it, mainly because the champ was unwilling or unable to get into the ring. Stallone has done a grand job in being the writer of all the Rocky films. \n\nThe cast make a final appearance, that is reasonably good. Stallone is good as Rocky once again. His character is still trying to make a contribution to fighting, after being told that he can no longer professionally fight in the ring. So he helps out fresh talent, Tommy Machine' Gunn, who is acted by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. I found this character to be just far to arrogant and stubborn, which in a way did not suit being a part of the Balboa corner. Tommy has had an interesting life, not only fighting wise, but in a personal way. He has been caught in drug rackets, drink driving and admitted to the world that he has contracted the fatal HIV virus. I am not so sure he is the greatest of actors though.\n\nThe normal cast members were good. Talia Shire's character Adrian, lets the world know that her husband is finished boxing and has nothing else to prove in the boxing ring. Making a special appearance was star from the first three films, that of Burgess Meredith. Just seeing him onscreen was really satisfying. Mickey was a favourite character of mine. I must mention that I liked seeing Stallone's very own son Sage, in Rocky as Rocky's son, Rocky Jnr. He was pretty good as the son that felt left out in the cold. He also has a mean punch like the old man as well. \n\nI found that all the Rocky films had terrific soundtracks. This is due to the great work by composer, Bill Conti. Bill has done a wonderful job in organising the music to go with all the fighting scenes and the poignant scenes which require that tune to set them off just nicely. Rocky five had probably the best song on any of the soundtracks, that being the Elton John hit Measure of a man'. I think it is a wonderful song, with some terrific lyrics. I have loved most of the music that the Rocky movies have given us.\n\nRocky V might not be the best movie ever made, but it certainly had some sort of impact on me. I believe if a movie only makes a slight impression on you, then it has achieved in a small way what it was meant to do. I heard that plans for Rocky VI were being made, with a script finished by Stallone just a few years ago. Personally, I feel that if it was to be made it would not be that great a film, because Balboa can no longer make a comeback in the ring, and if he does, he could well become  as his wife said disabled'. All things being said, these films are a terrific avenue of motivation and can help any person get the spark back to turn their luck around in any venture they pursue.\n\nRating 3 Stars or 6.5/10"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":132607,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1990-11-16","keywords":"rocky balboa jr character,rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,mickey goldmill character","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

When you're down and out, the best shot is, simply, to   Go for it!","reviewBody":"When a doctor or a family member tells you that the only life you have ever know is over, that can be a pretty bitter pill too swallow. In Rocky V, Rocky Balboa is faced with such a scenario. This movie proves to me that you need to have more than one string to your arrow, as you never know when it might come in handy one day. Rocky V also points out that money and possession are not the important things in life, but family and (true) friends are!\n\nLosing it all does not mean a thing unless you've got something to lose  And Rocky Balboa had it all. Times have changed, though, for former Heavyweight champion of the world. A lifetime of fighting has taken its toll, mentally and physically, and the maneuverings of an scrupulous accountant have left him financially strapped. But resiliency and the ability to come back have been trademarks of the Rocky legend. Just when it looks like the champ is down for the count, he discovers the raw talent of a young fighter named Tommy Gunn, who just might be Rocky's last chance for glory. In a world where achievement is marked by dollars and cents, and in a profession where success is measured in wins and losses, Rocky Balboa knows that, whatever the struggle, your only hope is to give it your best shot.\n\n This film is probably the weakest of the five films in the Rocky series. Yet there are some very good parts to it. The way we see Rocky get over bankruptcy was very good, as is the way he eventually makes his family the most important thing in his life. Again I found this story to be good, though I guess it lacked that real Rocky feel to it, mainly because the champ was unwilling or unable to get into the ring. Stallone has done a grand job in being the writer of all the Rocky films. \n\nThe cast make a final appearance, that is reasonably good. Stallone is good as Rocky once again. His character is still trying to make a contribution to fighting, after being told that he can no longer professionally fight in the ring. So he helps out fresh talent, Tommy Machine' Gunn, who is acted by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. I found this character to be just far to arrogant and stubborn, which in a way did not suit being a part of the Balboa corner. Tommy has had an interesting life, not only fighting wise, but in a personal way. He has been caught in drug rackets, drink driving and admitted to the world that he has contracted the fatal HIV virus. I am not so sure he is the greatest of actors though.\n\nThe normal cast members were good. Talia Shire's character Adrian, lets the world know that her husband is finished boxing and has nothing else to prove in the boxing ring. Making a special appearance was star from the first three films, that of Burgess Meredith. Just seeing him onscreen was really satisfying. Mickey was a favourite character of mine. I must mention that I liked seeing Stallone's very own son Sage, in Rocky as Rocky's son, Rocky Jnr. He was pretty good as the son that felt left out in the cold. He also has a mean punch like the old man as well. \n\nI found that all the Rocky films had terrific soundtracks. This is due to the great work by composer, Bill Conti. Bill has done a wonderful job in organising the music to go with all the fighting scenes and the poignant scenes which require that tune to set them off just nicely. Rocky five had probably the best song on any of the soundtracks, that being the Elton John hit Measure of a man'. I think it is a wonderful song, with some terrific lyrics. I have loved most of the music that the Rocky movies have given us.\n\nRocky V might not be the best movie ever made, but it certainly had some sort of impact on me. I believe if a movie only makes a slight impression on you, then it has achieved in a small way what it was meant to do. I heard that plans for Rocky VI were being made, with a script finished by Stallone just a few years ago. Personally, I feel that if it was to be made it would not be that great a film, because Balboa can no longer make a comeback in the ring, and if he does, he could well become  as his wife said disabled'. All things being said, these films are a terrific avenue of motivation and can help any person get the spark back to turn their luck around in any venture they pursue.\n\nRating 3 Stars or 6.5/10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":132607,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1990-11-16","keywords":"rocky balboa jr character,rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,mickey goldmill character","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

It is difficult to get into, but once the viewer gets into it, it is a funny, disturbing, and unique film. The plot is basically of a bellboy(played by the always good, Tim Roth) who has to take care of a hotel for the night on New Years Eve. He gets involved in some strange and off-color characters and slowly is driven insane by it all. There are four stories total. he first one is about a coven of witches who must find semen for their magic potion to resurrect a model. The second is about a suspicious husband who ties his wife up and holds a gun to the bellboy's face because he thinks she is cheating on him with the bellboy, only the bellboy soon discovers that this is just a weird trick. The third story(and by for the goriest) is about a rich man and his wife leaving his children alone at the hotel with the bellboy to babysit. And the forth is about a macabre bet involving a bunch of Hollywood yuppies, a car, a lighter, and removal of body parts.\n\nThe first story is really only for certain audiences. I didn't dig it, but I could see why certain people may. The jokes about sex and possible incest were tiresome, the witches were stereotypes and were poor ones, and the camera angles were terrible never allowing the audience to really get into the story. The reason why is because it is shown at a fly-on-the-wall distance and for a plot involving witches it helps to know what they are up to in a closer way. Normally this cinematic approach would work well, most noticeably the brilliant Peter Greenway film, THE COOK, THE THIEF, HIS WIFE, AND HER LOVER, which the movie strongly reminded me of for some reason and Tim Roth was also in it.\n\nThe second story was very perverse but didn't offer any way to involve the viewer in actually finding it interesting which it should have been. There is a sequence in which Tim Roth is put to inane stunt-work where he must get himself back into the apartment, even though he is falling out of it through the window. The stunt seems misguided and out of place in the drama of this story. The ideas are good, but the execution didn't quite work. Some pretty strange intensity by Jennifer Beals here.\n\nThe film takes a large jump forward into sharp comedy and independent ideas. The tone was mean-spirited and wicked. The children were appropriately mischievous and the father(Antonio Banderes) was nuts. The camera work was involving, and the comedic notes were hit correctly. The story worked and the viewer will have it stuck in their minds for days if they can't make it to the next story.\n\nThe best of the four is the last one, with quick and sensible dialog, an inspired plot, appropriate acting, and an off-kilter ending that is shocking, brutal, and brilliant.\n\nRated R for pervasive strong language, sexuality and some drug use."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":102070,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"1995-12-25","keywords":"gagged woman,tied to a chair,weapon,revolver,hotel room","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Four Rooms","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi821009945","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDYyNTFjNzktZDE0ZS00ZDE1LWFmOGUtZDczNmUxNDAzMzhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDYyNTFjNzktZDE0ZS00ZDE1LWFmOGUtZDczNmUxNDAzMzhiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0205423/","name":"Sammi Davis"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0025978/","name":"Allison Anders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734319/","name":"Alexandre Rockwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019267/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0025978/","name":"Allison Anders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0734319/","name":"Alexandre Rockwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is both.  The picture, shot on super 8 video and 16mm film displayed in a squared, documentary-like frame, is quirky, annoying, and spectacularly scary.  The scenes at night quite frankly scared the hell out of me.  The gimmick that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is created confusion and wonder over whether or not the footage shot was real life.  Now, we all know the truth, but the French term 'cinema verite' is defined by this grisly film.\n\nA guaranteed cult classic, BLAIR WITCH has "Heather, Mike, and Josh" heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills.  For most of the film, it is very unclear.  The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are a) experiencing the supernatural, b) being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople or c) just completely out of their minds.  Its up to the viewer to decide but my money is on option A.\n\nMost filmgoers know that the filmmakers Sanchez and Myrick used their MAC cards and cookie jars to put this phenom together and I commend them.  This is a tour-de-force thriller that does indeed seem real.  Its all improvised and 'verite' like and the best part about the movie's many chills are based on the basic premise that scares most of us:  We are generally frightened by what we cannot see.  Many times throughout the film, the screen is completely dark with sudden bursts of screams and grainy scenery.  For the sake of the suspense, the film may have been better if we did not know the gimmick.  The realism is sometimes smothering.\n\nTrue, the hand-held camera can make you achy in the head, but the way the actors play off each other is magic and not for the faint of heart.  I viewed the film on DVD with someone who was not feeling too well because of the dizzying camera, but somehow the black and white and color and rain blend together and allow Myrick and Sanchez to do what they were attempting to do.  Spooking an audience with unseen forces is so effective and I was reminded of Robert Wise's original THE HAUNTING from 1963 with the groans and the cries and the shrieks.  A baby's giggle can be heard during one spellbinding scene when the tent the 3 students sleep in takes on a life of its own.\n\nMuch has been made about a similar film made in similar fashion by some other young auteurs well before THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was released.  I never saw it and if it was as good as this film we would've seen it. Nonetheless, this past summer shocked and surprised me with the amount of good horror pictures around.  In the woods, no one can hear you scream either.\n\nRating: ***1/2","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":247148,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-11-24","keywords":"found footage,lost in the woods,supernatural horror,maryland,local legend","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Blair Witch Project","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi9044249","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ3MjNkNDMtMjA4Yy00OWI1LWE0YjktYzBlNmNlOWZjMWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ3MjNkNDMtMjA4Yy00OWI1LWE0YjktYzBlNmNlOWZjMWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Teaser Trailer for The Blair Witch Project"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231946/","name":"Heather Donahue"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0931321/","name":"Michael C.

It is both.  The picture, shot on super 8 video and 16mm film displayed in a squared, documentary-like frame, is quirky, annoying, and spectacularly scary.  The scenes at night quite frankly scared the hell out of me.  The gimmick that THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is created confusion and wonder over whether or not the footage shot was real life.  Now, we all know the truth, but the French term 'cinema verite' is defined by this grisly film.\n\nA guaranteed cult classic, BLAIR WITCH has "Heather, Mike, and Josh" heading off into the allegedly hexed woods of Maryland looking for the Blair Witch or whatever else may exist up in those hills.  For most of the film, it is very unclear.  The beginning excerpts ingeniously set up the three participants to believe they are a) experiencing the supernatural, b) being played like a fiddle by the suspicious townspeople or c) just completely out of their minds.  Its up to the viewer to decide but my money is on option A.\n\nMost filmgoers know that the filmmakers Sanchez and Myrick used their MAC cards and cookie jars to put this phenom together and I commend them.  This is a tour-de-force thriller that does indeed seem real.  Its all improvised and 'verite' like and the best part about the movie's many chills are based on the basic premise that scares most of us:  We are generally frightened by what we cannot see.  Many times throughout the film, the screen is completely dark with sudden bursts of screams and grainy scenery.  For the sake of the suspense, the film may have been better if we did not know the gimmick.  The realism is sometimes smothering.\n\nTrue, the hand-held camera can make you achy in the head, but the way the actors play off each other is magic and not for the faint of heart.  I viewed the film on DVD with someone who was not feeling too well because of the dizzying camera, but somehow the black and white and color and rain blend together and allow Myrick and Sanchez to do what they were attempting to do.  Spooking an audience with unseen forces is so effective and I was reminded of Robert Wise's original THE HAUNTING from 1963 with the groans and the cries and the shrieks.  A baby's giggle can be heard during one spellbinding scene when the tent the 3 students sleep in takes on a life of its own.\n\nMuch has been made about a similar film made in similar fashion by some other young auteurs well before THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT was released.  I never saw it and if it was as good as this film we would've seen it. Nonetheless, this past summer shocked and surprised me with the amount of good horror pictures around.  In the woods, no one can hear you scream either.\n\nRating: ***1/2","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":247148,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1999-11-24","keywords":"found footage,lost in the woods,supernatural horror,maryland,local legend","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Blair Witch Project","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi9044249","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ3MjNkNDMtMjA4Yy00OWI1LWE0YjktYzBlNmNlOWZjMWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDQ3MjNkNDMtMjA4Yy00OWI1LWE0YjktYzBlNmNlOWZjMWJkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Teaser Trailer for The Blair Witch Project","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0231946/","name":"Heather Donahue","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0931321/","name":"Michael C.

Since I love sword fighting movies/3 musketeer flicks, I just had to give it a try. Plus, I had seen the previews, and they looked interesting.  Well, let me tell you...from the opening scene to the ending credits, I was hooked with this film!  It grabbed my attention, and was just pure fun!! I don't know why this movie got such a low rating on IMDB.  It may not be a "masterpiece", but it's surely a great, fun, entertaining film!\n\nFirst of all, the cast is great.  I mean, have you seen so many good actors in one film?? Byrnes, Depardieu, Malcovich, DiCaprio, and Irons.  All such a WONDERFUL cast, with good acting.  I liked Leo's duel roles too.  At first I thought it would be cheesy, but Leo delivered it well!  He played both roles of Louis (bad king) and Phillipe (good king) so diversely!  I liked how he had you loving one king, and totally despising the other!  Someone also mentioned the way Leo totally changed characters with his "eyes".  THe "EYES" say a lot, and Leo nailed it.  I almost had to ask myself if this was the SAME actor playing Phillipe!\n\nThe plot was good (eh...might have been predictable, but still...great), the cinematagraphy was awesome, the music was moving, the sword fighting/action was cool! I absolutely loved Gabriel Byrnes in this movie.  He was so great as D'Artagnan (sp?).  John Malcovich was perfect for his role of Athos too. I really felt his pain.  I have both the VHS (older) and the DVD version (hey, it was on sale for 9 bucks!! lol) of The Man In The Iron Mask, and the DVD version (although not a whole lot of extras) has a nice directors commentary.  It really tells the director's vision for the film and all the behind the scene info.  I STILL can't believe that this movie was his FIRST film!!\n\nVery entertaining movie.  I really don't know why people dogged this movie so much.  It was SOOOO much better than that "OTHER" more RECENT musketeer movie that came out called "THE Musketeer".  UGghgh...what a dissapointment!\n\n But The Man In The Iron MASK is DEFINITELY a movie worth giving a try."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":162496,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1998-03-13","keywords":"17th century,france,twin,musketeer,three musketeers","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000460/","name":"Jeremy Irons"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000518/","name":"John Malkovich"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908824/","name":"Randall Wallace"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103797/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0241416/","name":"Alexandre Dumas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908824/","name":"Randall Wallace"}],"duration":"PT2H12M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Since I love sword fighting movies/3 musketeer flicks, I just had to give it a try. Plus, I had seen the previews, and they looked interesting.  Well, let me tell you...from the opening scene to the ending credits, I was hooked with this film!  It grabbed my attention, and was just pure fun!! I don't know why this movie got such a low rating on IMDB.  It may not be a "masterpiece", but it's surely a great, fun, entertaining film!\n\nFirst of all, the cast is great.  I mean, have you seen so many good actors in one film?? Byrnes, Depardieu, Malcovich, DiCaprio, and Irons.  All such a WONDERFUL cast, with good acting.  I liked Leo's duel roles too.  At first I thought it would be cheesy, but Leo delivered it well!  He played both roles of Louis (bad king) and Phillipe (good king) so diversely!  I liked how he had you loving one king, and totally despising the other!  Someone also mentioned the way Leo totally changed characters with his "eyes".  THe "EYES" say a lot, and Leo nailed it.  I almost had to ask myself if this was the SAME actor playing Phillipe!\n\nThe plot was good (eh...might have been predictable, but still...great), the cinematagraphy was awesome, the music was moving, the sword fighting/action was cool! I absolutely loved Gabriel Byrnes in this movie.  He was so great as D'Artagnan (sp?).  John Malcovich was perfect for his role of Athos too. I really felt his pain.  I have both the VHS (older) and the DVD version (hey, it was on sale for 9 bucks!! lol) of The Man In The Iron Mask, and the DVD version (although not a whole lot of extras) has a nice directors commentary.  It really tells the director's vision for the film and all the behind the scene info.  I STILL can't believe that this movie was his FIRST film!!\n\nVery entertaining movie.  I really don't know why people dogged this movie so much.  It was SOOOO much better than that "OTHER" more RECENT musketeer movie that came out called "THE Musketeer".  UGghgh...what a dissapointment!\n\n But The Man In The Iron MASK is DEFINITELY a movie worth giving a try.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":162496,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1998-03-13","keywords":"17th century,france,twin,musketeer,three musketeers","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000138/","name":"Leonardo DiCaprio","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000460/","name":"Jeremy Irons","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000518/","name":"John Malkovich"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908824/","name":"Randall Wallace"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103797/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0241416/","name":"Alexandre Dumas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908824/","name":"Randall Wallace"],"duration":"PT2H12M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When you're down and out, the best shot is, simply, to   Go for it!","reviewBody":"When a doctor or a family member tells you that the only life you have ever know is over, that can be a pretty bitter pill too swallow. In Rocky V, Rocky Balboa is faced with such a scenario. This movie proves to me that you need to have more than one string to your arrow, as you never know when it might come in handy one day. Rocky V also points out that money and possession are not the important things in life, but family and (true) friends are!\n\nLosing it all does not mean a thing unless you've got something to lose  And Rocky Balboa had it all. Times have changed, though, for former Heavyweight champion of the world. A lifetime of fighting has taken its toll, mentally and physically, and the maneuverings of an scrupulous accountant have left him financially strapped. But resiliency and the ability to come back have been trademarks of the Rocky legend. Just when it looks like the champ is down for the count, he discovers the raw talent of a young fighter named Tommy Gunn, who just might be Rocky's last chance for glory. In a world where achievement is marked by dollars and cents, and in a profession where success is measured in wins and losses, Rocky Balboa knows that, whatever the struggle, your only hope is to give it your best shot.\n\n This film is probably the weakest of the five films in the Rocky series. Yet there are some very good parts to it. The way we see Rocky get over bankruptcy was very good, as is the way he eventually makes his family the most important thing in his life. Again I found this story to be good, though I guess it lacked that real Rocky feel to it, mainly because the champ was unwilling or unable to get into the ring. Stallone has done a grand job in being the writer of all the Rocky films. \n\nThe cast make a final appearance, that is reasonably good. Stallone is good as Rocky once again. His character is still trying to make a contribution to fighting, after being told that he can no longer professionally fight in the ring. So he helps out fresh talent, Tommy Machine' Gunn, who is acted by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. I found this character to be just far to arrogant and stubborn, which in a way did not suit being a part of the Balboa corner. Tommy has had an interesting life, not only fighting wise, but in a personal way. He has been caught in drug rackets, drink driving and admitted to the world that he has contracted the fatal HIV virus. I am not so sure he is the greatest of actors though.\n\nThe normal cast members were good. Talia Shire's character Adrian, lets the world know that her husband is finished boxing and has nothing else to prove in the boxing ring. Making a special appearance was star from the first three films, that of Burgess Meredith. Just seeing him onscreen was really satisfying. Mickey was a favourite character of mine. I must mention that I liked seeing Stallone's very own son Sage, in Rocky as Rocky's son, Rocky Jnr. He was pretty good as the son that felt left out in the cold. He also has a mean punch like the old man as well. \n\nI found that all the Rocky films had terrific soundtracks. This is due to the great work by composer, Bill Conti. Bill has done a wonderful job in organising the music to go with all the fighting scenes and the poignant scenes which require that tune to set them off just nicely. Rocky five had probably the best song on any of the soundtracks, that being the Elton John hit Measure of a man'. I think it is a wonderful song, with some terrific lyrics. I have loved most of the music that the Rocky movies have given us.\n\nRocky V might not be the best movie ever made, but it certainly had some sort of impact on me. I believe if a movie only makes a slight impression on you, then it has achieved in a small way what it was meant to do. I heard that plans for Rocky VI were being made, with a script finished by Stallone just a few years ago. Personally, I feel that if it was to be made it would not be that great a film, because Balboa can no longer make a comeback in the ring, and if he does, he could well become  as his wife said disabled'. All things being said, these films are a terrific avenue of motivation and can help any person get the spark back to turn their luck around in any venture they pursue.\n\nRating 3 Stars or 6.5/10"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":132607,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1990-11-16","keywords":"rocky balboa jr character,rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,mickey goldmill character","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

In a world where achievement is marked by dollars and cents, and in a profession where success is measured in wins and losses, Rocky Balboa knows that, whatever the struggle, your only hope is to give it your best shot.\n\n This film is probably the weakest of the five films in the Rocky series. Yet there are some very good parts to it. The way we see Rocky get over bankruptcy was very good, as is the way he eventually makes his family the most important thing in his life. Again I found this story to be good, though I guess it lacked that real Rocky feel to it, mainly because the champ was unwilling or unable to get into the ring. Stallone has done a grand job in being the writer of all the Rocky films. \n\nThe cast make a final appearance, that is reasonably good. Stallone is good as Rocky once again. His character is still trying to make a contribution to fighting, after being told that he can no longer professionally fight in the ring. So he helps out fresh talent, Tommy Machine' Gunn, who is acted by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. I found this character to be just far to arrogant and stubborn, which in a way did not suit being a part of the Balboa corner. Tommy has had an interesting life, not only fighting wise, but in a personal way. He has been caught in drug rackets, drink driving and admitted to the world that he has contracted the fatal HIV virus. I am not so sure he is the greatest of actors though.\n\nThe normal cast members were good. Talia Shire's character Adrian, lets the world know that her husband is finished boxing and has nothing else to prove in the boxing ring. Making a special appearance was star from the first three films, that of Burgess Meredith. Just seeing him onscreen was really satisfying. Mickey was a favourite character of mine. I must mention that I liked seeing Stallone's very own son Sage, in Rocky as Rocky's son, Rocky Jnr. He was pretty good as the son that felt left out in the cold. He also has a mean punch like the old man as well. \n\nI found that all the Rocky films had terrific soundtracks. This is due to the great work by composer, Bill Conti. Bill has done a wonderful job in organising the music to go with all the fighting scenes and the poignant scenes which require that tune to set them off just nicely. Rocky five had probably the best song on any of the soundtracks, that being the Elton John hit Measure of a man'. I think it is a wonderful song, with some terrific lyrics. I have loved most of the music that the Rocky movies have given us.\n\nRocky V might not be the best movie ever made, but it certainly had some sort of impact on me. I believe if a movie only makes a slight impression on you, then it has achieved in a small way what it was meant to do. I heard that plans for Rocky VI were being made, with a script finished by Stallone just a few years ago. Personally, I feel that if it was to be made it would not be that great a film, because Balboa can no longer make a comeback in the ring, and if he does, he could well become  as his wife said disabled'. All things being said, these films are a terrific avenue of motivation and can help any person get the spark back to turn their luck around in any venture they pursue.\n\nRating 3 Stars or 6.5/10","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":132607,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1990-11-16","keywords":"rocky balboa jr character,rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,mickey goldmill character","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

For much of the film you only see Khary Payton's character Michael Forest, doing his day to day routine astronaut activities. What could be a boring concept is not and you are entertained by his performance making you care deeply about his character Michael. You'll be asking yourself how would I handle being all alone in space. I am sure I would not be able to do it. I have even more respect for astronauts after watching this movie. All in all I think Payton's performance anchors the film and allows it to build to a surprising ending. I recommend this film to all movie lovers out there.

For much of the film you only see Khary Payton's character Michael Forest, doing his day to day routine astronaut activities. What could be a boring concept is not and you are entertained by his performance making you care deeply about his character Michael. You'll be asking yourself how would I handle being all alone in space. I am sure I would not be able to do it. I have even more respect for astronauts after watching this movie. All in all I think Payton's performance anchors the film and allows it to build to a surprising ending. I recommend this film to all movie lovers out there. If you collect space movies, you will definitely want to add this one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1720,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-06-16","keywords":"accident,low budget sci fi movie","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Last Push","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi735054105","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjAwNjc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5MzM5Mw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMzMjAwNjc4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTA5MzM5Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A science fiction art film about an adventurous mission to Jupiter's moon that is cut short when disaster strikes, killing the co-pilot.

The dinosaurs don't steal the show as much as they should and their contributions not particularly memorable or well used. The human characters are underwritten and have little development or endearing personality, despite the actors' best efforts.\n\nAlso found too much of the dialogue on the wrong side of dumb and cheesy, complete with some soapy moments, and that it didn't flow very well. The film is extremely derivative, interesting premise with far too over-familiar execution that has nothing new. The lack of imagination and suspense also hurts the film, too much evokes cringing and the thrills are sporadic. The direction felt like they were not in control of the material and not at ease with the genre. \n\nOverall, not a disaster, not a thrill side.
