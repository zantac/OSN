The doomed effort " Elephants walk" (later replaced by Elizabeth Taylor)is also mentioned .\n\nShe always insisted that she would be free to play on stage and on screen ,that's why her filmography is rather small .\n\nMuch time is given over to her legendary love affair with Laurence Olivier (they were both married with children when they met); Leigh suffered from scathing critics by Kenneth Tynan who wrote that she spoiled her husband's playing .He was to revise his opinion later.\n\nAfter her divorce , actor Jack Merivale took good care of her (he knew of her health problems) The biopic ends with pictures of her last movie which featured French actress Simone Signoret who showed sympathy for her during the shooting.\n\nA legend.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":27,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5,"genre":["Documentary","Biography"],"datePublished":"2020-01-03","keywords":"vivien leigh,bipolar disorder","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0123933/","name":"Mathieu Buscatto","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000046/","name":"Vivien Leigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0503333/","name":"Elsa Lepoivre"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4891785/","name":"Priscilla Pizzato"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079103/"],"duration":"PT52M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

What's so unusual is that in the movie "Death Wish" he played a man who was a pacifist all of his life, he served in the Korean War as a conscientious objector, who then turned into the vigilante executioner! A role which Bronson has become known for and identified with more then any of the scores of actions roles that he made during his long film career.\n\nBronson as well as director Michael Winner and writer Brian Garfield touched a raw nerve in "Death Wish" with the American people in big cities under siege like no other movie ever did before and, now some 30 years later, after. Since "Death Wish" there must have been made over a hundred films with it's theme but none had the impact that "Death Wish" with Charles Bronson had. \n\nA group of tugs get Joanna Kersey's, Hope Lange, address from a delivery slip of a local grocery store and acting as if their delivering her groceries break into Joanna's apartment and savagely attack her and beat and rape her daughter Carol, Kathleen Tolan. Paul Kersey, Charles Bronson, comes home to learn that his wife and daughter are in the hospital rushes over to see how they are. Kersey finds out that his wife is dead and his daughter is mentally destroyed and needs to be institutionalized for life. \n\nThe whole world around Paul Kersey falls apart like a house of cards and he's left alone with everything that he loved dead or as good as dead. Some time later going to Arizona to do his job as a land developer for his firm in NYC he's given a .32 handgun as a gift by the person that he worked for Ames Janichill, Stuart Margolis, for the great job that he did for him.\n\nOne night back home in New York City taking a stroll in the park with the gun on him Kersey is accosted by a local junkie who pulls a handgun on him but Kersey draws first and shoots and kills him. Sick at first over what he did, killed a human being, Kersey like a wild beast from the jungle tasting blood for the fist time begins to roam the streets of New York at night for prey. A vengeful Kersey goes out looking for criminals to put out of commission, like those who killed and raped his wife and daughter, as some kind of revenge and retribution against them. In the process Kersey puts the criminals of the city of New York into a state of absolute terror and panic. In his guerrilla-like actions Kersey knocks off some dozen of them sending the the city's crime rate falling as much as 70%! All this with the ineffective, in stopping crime, police being more interested in stopping "The Vigilante" then stopping the criminals! \n\nThe movie "Death Wish" hit a raw nerve with the public as well as the local politicians and police because it showed how, in the movie at least, one man with a gun and knowing how to use it can make a difference when it comes to stopping crime. The story is not that unlikely as those against it would want the public to believe. There's been many times when average people took to protecting themselves, with firearms, and did a much better job then the police; which is just what Paul Kersey did in the movie. That may have been one of the reasons that those in authority were so much against the film. \n\nWhen Bernie Goetz in December 1984 gunned down four muggers, much like Charles Bronson did in the movie "Death Wish", who tried to attack him in the New York subway crime dropped a lot more then if one hundred policemen were put on the trains. Nobody can doubt now that Charles Bronson's "Death Wish" was not only a major milestone in films about urban crime but also a major milestone in what the public thinks about crime and what's best to do to stop it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37991,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1974-07-24","keywords":"vigilante,home invasion,gang rape,crime victim,vigilante justice","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192818457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg4ZTM0NTMtMjk0My00ZGY3LTg2OGYtYWNhZTVhOGY2YTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg4ZTM0NTMtMjk0My00ZGY3LTg2OGYtYWNhZTVhOGY2YTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000314/","name":"Charles Bronson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0486136/","name":"Hope Lange"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0306696/","name":"Vincent Gardenia"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935382/","name":"Michael Winner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0682093/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0670561/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307257/","name":"Brian Garfield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562606/","name":"Wendell Mayes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933449/","name":"Gerald Wilson"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Nobody can doubt now that Charles Bronson's "Death Wish" was not only a major milestone in films about urban crime but also a major milestone in what the public thinks about crime and what's best to do to stop it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37991,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1974-07-24","keywords":"vigilante,home invasion,gang rape,crime victim,vigilante justice","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192818457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg4ZTM0NTMtMjk0My00ZGY3LTg2OGYtYWNhZTVhOGY2YTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg4ZTM0NTMtMjk0My00ZGY3LTg2OGYtYWNhZTVhOGY2YTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000314/","name":"Charles Bronson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0486136/","name":"Hope Lange","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0306696/","name":"Vincent Gardenia"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935382/","name":"Michael Winner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0682093/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0670561/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307257/","name":"Brian Garfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562606/","name":"Wendell Mayes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933449/","name":"Gerald Wilson"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I for one cannot wait to see this film in theatres again soon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11370,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","History","War"],"datePublished":"2006-03-31","keywords":"africa,rwanda,genocide,faith,school","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Beyond the Gates (2005)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1334968601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTZmNDk5MTYtZjgzYy00YmM0LWExYWUtY2U1M2E1NzEyY2EwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTZmNDk5MTYtZjgzYy00YmM0LWExYWUtY2U1M2E1NzEyY2EwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from IFC Films","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000457/","name":"John Hurt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0199215/","name":"Hugh Dancy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0395850/","name":"Dominique Horwitz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001994/","name":"Michael Caton-Jones"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139826/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164664/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0938727/","name":"David Wolstencroft","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2017213/","name":"Richard Alwyn","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0069582/","name":"David Belton"],"duration":"PT1H55M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Major co-stars include Robert Englund (Freddy Krueger himself!), John Neville and an uncredited Brad Dourif, who features heavily in a powerful opening sequence where Blanks and Horta pull a major switcheroo on the audience (I'll say no more). Loretta Devine is amusing as the campus security guard who views herself as a modern-day Coffy/Pam Grier (her fantasy is rudely curtailed by a climactic encounter with the rampaging maniac), and there's a brief appearance by Danielle Harris, the former child star of HALLOWEEN 4: THE RETURN OF MICHAEL MYERS (1988) and HALLOWEEN 5 (1989), playing an adult character FAR removed from the angelic poppet of those earlier pictures!

What's so unusual is that in the movie "Death Wish" he played a man who was a pacifist all of his life, he served in the Korean War as a conscientious objector, who then turned into the vigilante executioner! A role which Bronson has become known for and identified with more then any of the scores of actions roles that he made during his long film career.\n\nBronson as well as director Michael Winner and writer Brian Garfield touched a raw nerve in "Death Wish" with the American people in big cities under siege like no other movie ever did before and, now some 30 years later, after. Since "Death Wish" there must have been made over a hundred films with it's theme but none had the impact that "Death Wish" with Charles Bronson had. \n\nA group of tugs get Joanna Kersey's, Hope Lange, address from a delivery slip of a local grocery store and acting as if their delivering her groceries break into Joanna's apartment and savagely attack her and beat and rape her daughter Carol, Kathleen Tolan. Paul Kersey, Charles Bronson, comes home to learn that his wife and daughter are in the hospital rushes over to see how they are. Kersey finds out that his wife is dead and his daughter is mentally destroyed and needs to be institutionalized for life. \n\nThe whole world around Paul Kersey falls apart like a house of cards and he's left alone with everything that he loved dead or as good as dead. Some time later going to Arizona to do his job as a land developer for his firm in NYC he's given a .32 handgun as a gift by the person that he worked for Ames Janichill, Stuart Margolis, for the great job that he did for him.\n\nOne night back home in New York City taking a stroll in the park with the gun on him Kersey is accosted by a local junkie who pulls a handgun on him but Kersey draws first and shoots and kills him. Sick at first over what he did, killed a human being, Kersey like a wild beast from the jungle tasting blood for the fist time begins to roam the streets of New York at night for prey. A vengeful Kersey goes out looking for criminals to put out of commission, like those who killed and raped his wife and daughter, as some kind of revenge and retribution against them. In the process Kersey puts the criminals of the city of New York into a state of absolute terror and panic. In his guerrilla-like actions Kersey knocks off some dozen of them sending the the city's crime rate falling as much as 70%! All this with the ineffective, in stopping crime, police being more interested in stopping "The Vigilante" then stopping the criminals! \n\nThe movie "Death Wish" hit a raw nerve with the public as well as the local politicians and police because it showed how, in the movie at least, one man with a gun and knowing how to use it can make a difference when it comes to stopping crime. The story is not that unlikely as those against it would want the public to believe. There's been many times when average people took to protecting themselves, with firearms, and did a much better job then the police; which is just what Paul Kersey did in the movie. That may have been one of the reasons that those in authority were so much against the film. \n\nWhen Bernie Goetz in December 1984 gunned down four muggers, much like Charles Bronson did in the movie "Death Wish", who tried to attack him in the New York subway crime dropped a lot more then if one hundred policemen were put on the trains. Nobody can doubt now that Charles Bronson's "Death Wish" was not only a major milestone in films about urban crime but also a major milestone in what the public thinks about crime and what's best to do to stop it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37991,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1974-07-24","keywords":"vigilante,home invasion,gang rape,crime victim,vigilante justice","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192818457","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg4ZTM0NTMtMjk0My00ZGY3LTg2OGYtYWNhZTVhOGY2YTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg4ZTM0NTMtMjk0My00ZGY3LTg2OGYtYWNhZTVhOGY2YTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000314/","name":"Charles Bronson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0486136/","name":"Hope Lange"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0306696/","name":"Vincent Gardenia"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935382/","name":"Michael Winner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0682093/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0670561/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307257/","name":"Brian Garfield"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562606/","name":"Wendell Mayes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933449/","name":"Gerald Wilson"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In his guerrilla-like actions Kersey knocks off some dozen of them sending the the city's crime rate falling as much as 70%! All this with the ineffective, in stopping crime, police being more interested in stopping "The Vigilante" then stopping the criminals! \n\nThe movie "Death Wish" hit a raw nerve with the public as well as the local politicians and police because it showed how, in the movie at least, one man with a gun and knowing how to use it can make a difference when it comes to stopping crime. The story is not that unlikely as those against it would want the public to believe. There's been many times when average people took to protecting themselves, with firearms, and did a much better job then the police; which is just what Paul Kersey did in the movie. That may have been one of the reasons that those in authority were so much against the film. \n\nWhen Bernie Goetz in December 1984 gunned down four muggers, much like Charles Bronson did in the movie "Death Wish", who tried to attack him in the New York subway crime dropped a lot more then if one hundred policemen were put on the trains. Nobody can doubt now that Charles Bronson's "Death Wish" was not only a major milestone in films about urban crime but also a major milestone in what the public thinks about crime and what's best to do to stop it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37991,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1974-07-24","keywords":"vigilante,home invasion,gang rape,crime victim,vigilante justice","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2192818457","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg4ZTM0NTMtMjk0My00ZGY3LTg2OGYtYWNhZTVhOGY2YTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTg4ZTM0NTMtMjk0My00ZGY3LTg2OGYtYWNhZTVhOGY2YTU1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000314/","name":"Charles Bronson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0486136/","name":"Hope Lange","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0306696/","name":"Vincent Gardenia"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0935382/","name":"Michael Winner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0682093/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0670561/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0307257/","name":"Brian Garfield","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0562606/","name":"Wendell Mayes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933449/","name":"Gerald Wilson"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's the movie itself.\n\nFirst off the bat are the laughable characters. A convict who then leads a team of firefighters? What were the producers smoking when somebody came up with the script? Not only is the premise obscenely stupid (and an insult of firefighters), the actress who plays the character clearly cannot deliver a decent line without sounding like she's reading off a cue card. Her screen presence is laughable, and the scenes where she tries to order people around are especially cringe-worthy...I've heard nails been dragged across a chalkboard that was more pleasing to the ears. Oh wait...ALL her lines sound like that. How does somebody without a smidgen of acting ability and a voice like a hyena(a hyena with a very bad sore throat) get into movies? Are they casting off the streets now?Also, how the hell would one believe she's the leader of a group of firefighters with a body like that? How's does she propose to put out a fire with her flabby physique? Rolling over them and hoping her monstrous bulk snuffs them out? \n\nOf course, that's the just beginning of how lame this movie is. Laughable special effects(fire that look as realistic as cardboard cutouts) make even movies don't in the 70s and 80s look cutting edge. Seriously, watch Clash of the Titans or Seven Voyages of Sinbad and then tell me that the SFX from those oldies don't outshine the insultingly bad ones found here.\n\nThen there's the overuse of stock footage. More than half the time, it feels like you're watching a news program or documentary. Hell, I wished that was the case...at least you might learn something from them. The only thing you'll learn from this fiasco is to avoid it at all costs.\n\nIf you don't have the budget to make a movie, don't. This is a prime reason why not.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":189,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-11-01","keywords":"psychotronic film","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0325097/","name":"Tracey Gold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910170/","name":"Alexander Walters"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0239294/","name":"Ellen Dubin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1028302/","name":"Jason Bourque"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086887/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086179/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045895/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2091795/","name":"Dana Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1433581/","name":"Keith Shaw"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's the movie itself.\n\nFirst off the bat are the laughable characters. A convict who then leads a team of firefighters? What were the producers smoking when somebody came up with the script? Not only is the premise obscenely stupid (and an insult of firefighters), the actress who plays the character clearly cannot deliver a decent line without sounding like she's reading off a cue card. Her screen presence is laughable, and the scenes where she tries to order people around are especially cringe-worthy...I've heard nails been dragged across a chalkboard that was more pleasing to the ears. Oh wait...ALL her lines sound like that. How does somebody without a smidgen of acting ability and a voice like a hyena(a hyena with a very bad sore throat) get into movies? Are they casting off the streets now?Also, how the hell would one believe she's the leader of a group of firefighters with a body like that? How's does she propose to put out a fire with her flabby physique? Rolling over them and hoping her monstrous bulk snuffs them out? \n\nOf course, that's the just beginning of how lame this movie is. Laughable special effects(fire that look as realistic as cardboard cutouts) make even movies don't in the 70s and 80s look cutting edge. Seriously, watch Clash of the Titans or Seven Voyages of Sinbad and then tell me that the SFX from those oldies don't outshine the insultingly bad ones found here.\n\nThen there's the overuse of stock footage. More than half the time, it feels like you're watching a news program or documentary. Hell, I wished that was the case...at least you might learn something from them. The only thing you'll learn from this fiasco is to avoid it at all costs.\n\nIf you don't have the budget to make a movie, don't. This is a prime reason why not.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":1,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":189,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Drama"],"datePublished":"2002-11-01","keywords":"psychotronic film","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0325097/","name":"Tracey Gold","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910170/","name":"Alexander Walters","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0239294/","name":"Ellen Dubin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1028302/","name":"Jason Bourque"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086887/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0086179/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0045895/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2091795/","name":"Dana Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1433581/","name":"Keith Shaw"],"duration":"PT1H40M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is a classical and well written robbery story, complex enough to catch the interest, simple enough for the spectator to follow and enjoy, and with the special twist at the end that makes a good script. The main character fits Nick Nolte like life, I can imagine only Humphrey Bogart doing better in this role. There are a few other memorable characters, with the Georgian (from the other Georgia) Nutza Kukhianidze promising to become soon a star if she has enough luck to continue to work with good directors and scripts. The cinematography has a special quality, with final stills after each shot, enhancing a good digital camera work. I also liked the soundtrack, it's a mix of classic, jazz and even Leonard Cohen sounds right for a change. 8/10 on my personal scale - certainly worth seeing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10380,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-02-28","keywords":"heist,casino,gambler,monte carlo,voyeur","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Good Thief","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi401801497","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0ZTNlZTItNWE5OS00NTZhLWExMzEtNGM2YThlYjBjZjY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0ZTNlZTItNWE5OS00NTZhLWExMzEtNGM2YThlYjBjZjY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000560/","name":"Nick Nolte"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000146/","name":"Ralph Fiennes"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0474333/","name":"Nutsa Kukhianidze"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001403/","name":"Neil Jordan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090341/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103900/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494138/","name":"Auguste Le Breton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578483/","name":"Jean-Pierre Melville"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001403/","name":"Neil Jordan"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is a classical and well written robbery story, complex enough to catch the interest, simple enough for the spectator to follow and enjoy, and with the special twist at the end that makes a good script. The main character fits Nick Nolte like life, I can imagine only Humphrey Bogart doing better in this role. There are a few other memorable characters, with the Georgian (from the other Georgia) Nutza Kukhianidze promising to become soon a star if she has enough luck to continue to work with good directors and scripts. The cinematography has a special quality, with final stills after each shot, enhancing a good digital camera work. I also liked the soundtrack, it's a mix of classic, jazz and even Leonard Cohen sounds right for a change. 8/10 on my personal scale - certainly worth seeing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10380,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2003-02-28","keywords":"heist,casino,gambler,monte carlo,voyeur","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Good Thief","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi401801497","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0ZTNlZTItNWE5OS00NTZhLWExMzEtNGM2YThlYjBjZjY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjY0ZTNlZTItNWE5OS00NTZhLWExMzEtNGM2YThlYjBjZjY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000560/","name":"Nick Nolte","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000146/","name":"Ralph Fiennes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0474333/","name":"Nutsa Kukhianidze"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001403/","name":"Neil Jordan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054762/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090341/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103900/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0494138/","name":"Auguste Le Breton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0578483/","name":"Jean-Pierre Melville","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001403/","name":"Neil Jordan"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Many seem to have preferred the raw look that 'El Mariachi' had and while 'Desperado' is more 'sophisticated' in the making and more polished, that doesn't prevent it from being an awesome action entertainer. For me, it was just as much fun as 'El Mariachi'. Rodriguez does what he does best. He already mentioned that his Mariachi films are a tribute to the western cinema that names like Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood defined and 'Desperado' works perfectly with its comic book story, quirky characters and over-the-top action sequences. Moving at a rapid pace, the direction and editing are top notch. The cinematography is brilliant too. Antonio Banderas does a good job taking over the role from Carlos Gallardo (who sort of plays his sidekick in this one). However, it is Salma Hayek that steals the show even though the story is dominated by El Mariachi. As Carolina, she is sensual, witty, charming and quite clever too. Hayek delivers a very natural performance and owns each and every one of her scenes. In addition, there are some wonderful cameos by Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino, Steve Buscemi and Danny Trejo. Overall, 'Desperado' is full throttle entertainment. This is what an action entertainer is supposed to be."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":179513,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1995-08-25","keywords":"contemporary western,mexican,one against many,lone wolf,musician","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Desperado","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3315663129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWI0MjU0YWQtZDgyZi00Y2NmLTliOGItNTEwZDg5OTc4YmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWI0MjU0YWQtZDgyZi00Y2NmLTliOGItNTEwZDg5OTc4YmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"text os"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0021835/","name":"Joaquim de Almeida"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0870559/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"}],"duration":"PT1H44M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Many seem to have preferred the raw look that 'El Mariachi' had and while 'Desperado' is more 'sophisticated' in the making and more polished, that doesn't prevent it from being an awesome action entertainer. For me, it was just as much fun as 'El Mariachi'. Rodriguez does what he does best. He already mentioned that his Mariachi films are a tribute to the western cinema that names like Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood defined and 'Desperado' works perfectly with its comic book story, quirky characters and over-the-top action sequences. Moving at a rapid pace, the direction and editing are top notch. The cinematography is brilliant too. Antonio Banderas does a good job taking over the role from Carlos Gallardo (who sort of plays his sidekick in this one). However, it is Salma Hayek that steals the show even though the story is dominated by El Mariachi. As Carolina, she is sensual, witty, charming and quite clever too. Hayek delivers a very natural performance and owns each and every one of her scenes. In addition, there are some wonderful cameos by Cheech Marin, Quentin Tarantino, Steve Buscemi and Danny Trejo. Overall, 'Desperado' is full throttle entertainment. This is what an action entertainer is supposed to be.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":179513,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1995-08-25","keywords":"contemporary western,mexican,one against many,lone wolf,musician","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Desperado","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3315663129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWI0MjU0YWQtZDgyZi00Y2NmLTliOGItNTEwZDg5OTc4YmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWI0MjU0YWQtZDgyZi00Y2NmLTliOGItNTEwZDg5OTc4YmE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"text os","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000104/","name":"Antonio Banderas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000161/","name":"Salma Hayek","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0021835/","name":"Joaquim de Almeida"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0870559/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001675/","name":"Robert Rodriguez"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If Anna Faris, most commonly known as the one portraying/making fun of the Neve Campbell "Scream" role in the "Scary Movies" was ever going to become the next big female comedienne the time would be now. She showed she was willing to make fun of herself in those movies but I still wonder if she can play a sincere, actual human being rather than a character meant to be the punch line most of the time. "Bunny" was written by "Blonde" screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and Kirsten Smith so that could be good news but a lot of the weight of this movie is going to rest on the shoulders of it star. Reese Witherspoon made that movie what it was and the big question here is, can Faris do the same? \n\nShe plays Shelley, a ditzy playboy bunny with big dreams of becoming the next centerfold who instead is tossed out on her ass by Hugh after her 27th birthday. Shelley went from the orphanage to the mansion so she never quite got the fill gist of the outside world. Now homeless and with very few survival skills, she has no idea what to do next. Just through happenstance, she encounters something that looks like a mini Playboy mansion but is in fact the best college sorority on campus. They decline her for house mother but she finds a home with the Zeta sorority, a group of misfit girls, led by Natalie (Emma Stone), who seriously need to improve their image and attract new members in order to stop the college from closing their house. Enter Shelley to give the girls make-overs.\n\nThis movie made me laugh out loud twice. One involved the manhole cover joke in the trailer, and the other was a really good jab at Bob Saget. The rest of the movie is likable and has a nice message but really can't seem to wring that many laughs out of a good premise. It's a parody against the bimbo ideology, first having Shelley turn the girls into mindless, skimpy-looking prostitutes only to realize later that you also have to have substance too. Sometimes it gets a few chuckles and other times it comes off looking embarrassingly sitcom-ish, like when Shelley tries to look brainy to impress a guy by wearing very thick glasses that make her dizzy, but overall the script isn't as smart or funny as "Legally Blonde" and that hurts its chances. The movie also treats some of the secondary characters in really bad taste, like a girl whose such a misfit she actually talks like Frankenstein and walks like Igor, and I was confused by some others, like a girl who supposedly is bad with boys and yet is pregnant.\n\nI was also confused by the mental abilities of the main character. At times she seems dumber than dirt and at other times she seems almost profound. That she works regardless of this has less to do with the script and more to do with Anna Faris. I don't think this will be the star-making role I thought it would be for her but she gives Shelley a very sweet, genial nature and she is willing to throw herself into silly situations with an innocent and goofy charm. Emma Stone is also pretty funny in this movie, dialing up the dorky meter to about an 8. I feel bad for Colin Hanks though. This kid just doesn't seem to be getting many chances to shine, and here he's wasted as the romantic lead in a movie that's pretty low on the romance.\n\n"The House Bunny" begins, middles, and ends like most college movies do, just unfortunately its not funny or clever enough to distract from the generic plotting. Most of the secondary characters are also wasted as well but maybe, it will put Anna Faris on some people's radars. She is a very funny comic actress and with the right script, its possible she could be the next big thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-10-15","keywords":"sorority,playboy bunny,playboy model,playboy mansion,female nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The House Bunny","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1305281305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAxYzc3ODQtMGZmMy00ZWVjLTlkODItYzBkNzVlMzE1NzFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAxYzc3ODQtMGZmMy00ZWVjLTlkODItYzBkNzVlMzE1NzFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"A romantic comedy film, directed by Fred Wolf"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267506/","name":"Anna Faris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004988/","name":"Colin Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527581/","name":"Karen McCullah"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0809006/","name":"Kirsten Smith"}],"duration":"PT1H37M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's a parody against the bimbo ideology, first having Shelley turn the girls into mindless, skimpy-looking prostitutes only to realize later that you also have to have substance too. Sometimes it gets a few chuckles and other times it comes off looking embarrassingly sitcom-ish, like when Shelley tries to look brainy to impress a guy by wearing very thick glasses that make her dizzy, but overall the script isn't as smart or funny as "Legally Blonde" and that hurts its chances. The movie also treats some of the secondary characters in really bad taste, like a girl whose such a misfit she actually talks like Frankenstein and walks like Igor, and I was confused by some others, like a girl who supposedly is bad with boys and yet is pregnant.\n\nI was also confused by the mental abilities of the main character. At times she seems dumber than dirt and at other times she seems almost profound. That she works regardless of this has less to do with the script and more to do with Anna Faris. I don't think this will be the star-making role I thought it would be for her but she gives Shelley a very sweet, genial nature and she is willing to throw herself into silly situations with an innocent and goofy charm. Emma Stone is also pretty funny in this movie, dialing up the dorky meter to about an 8. I feel bad for Colin Hanks though. This kid just doesn't seem to be getting many chances to shine, and here he's wasted as the romantic lead in a movie that's pretty low on the romance.\n\n"The House Bunny" begins, middles, and ends like most college movies do, just unfortunately its not funny or clever enough to distract from the generic plotting. Most of the secondary characters are also wasted as well but maybe, it will put Anna Faris on some people's radars. She is a very funny comic actress and with the right script, its possible she could be the next big thing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":82064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-10-15","keywords":"sorority,playboy bunny,playboy model,playboy mansion,female nudity","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The House Bunny","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1305281305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAxYzc3ODQtMGZmMy00ZWVjLTlkODItYzBkNzVlMzE1NzFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODAxYzc3ODQtMGZmMy00ZWVjLTlkODItYzBkNzVlMzE1NzFmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"A romantic comedy film, directed by Fred Wolf","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0267506/","name":"Anna Faris","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004988/","name":"Colin Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1297015/","name":"Emma Stone"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0937748/","name":"Fred Wolf"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0059609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0527581/","name":"Karen McCullah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0809006/","name":"Kirsten Smith"],"duration":"PT1H37M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I cannot make an honest opinion yet on the plots and direction of the series until I see more of it, but the imagery alone is a good start for this series.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71645,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-04-01","keywords":"sex scene,king,royalty,king henry viii,english court","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001667/","name":"Jonathan Rhys Meyers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0147147/","name":"Henry Cavill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0112390/","name":"Anthony Brophy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078130/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052980/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0082215/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0386694/","name":"Michael Hirst"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Tudors: Season 4: The Final Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3776092441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwY2E4Y2EtNmMyNy00MjFiLTg0ODgtNWVhMzhlYTQ0OTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwY2E4Y2EtNmMyNy00MjFiLTg0ODgtNWVhMzhlYTQ0OTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Tudors: The Final Season"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">The Dark Tower: Directed by Nikolaj Arcel. With Matthew McConaughey, Idris Elba, Tom Taylor, Dennis Haysbert. A boy haunted by visions of a dark tower from a parallel reality teams up with the tower's disillusioned guardian to stop an evil warlock known as the Man in Black who plans to use the boy to destroy the tower and open the gates of Hell." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1648190/","name":"The Dark Tower","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU3MjUwMzQ3MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjcwNjkxMjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A boy haunted by visions of a dark tower from a parallel reality teams up with the tower's disillusioned guardian to stop an evil warlock known as the Man in Black who plans to use the boy to destroy the tower and open the gates of H","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1648190/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"wileyschmitt"},"dateCreated":"2017-08-03","inLanguage":"English","name":"No Expectations = Enjoyable Experience","reviewBody":"I've been looking forward to seeing this movie for a few years, I've read all the books including the more recent one ('The Wind Thru the Keyhole') and other books that Walter appeared in. It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.\n\nI thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.\n\nBottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).\n\nIf you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-08-04","keywords":"gunslinger,based on novel,prophetic dream,another world,parallel dimension","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1690417433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, roams an Old West-like landscape where "the world has moved on" in pursuit of the man in black.

It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.\n\nI thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.\n\nBottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).\n\nIf you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-08-04","keywords":"gunslinger,based on novel,prophetic dream,another world,parallel dimension","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1690417433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, roams an Old West-like landscape where "the world has moved on" in pursuit of the man in black.

I think the most impressive thing about it was its commitment to building on the mythology set forth by the original. It managed to expand on the original and give us answers to what happened to characters after it in ways that felt clever, fresh, and still faithful to it. It manages to be about the continuation of certain events in the first film while creating a new fascinating character at its core and manages to tell the new character's arc brilliantly. To reiterate, it's very well written, managing to avoid the clichés that usually transpire in films like this. Villeneuve has quickly become one of the best filmmakers currently working and this is only another example of his talent. However, the original was much better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":513093,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-10-05","keywords":"female nudity,environmental damage,corporatist,capitalism,sex scene","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"At Cinemas Now","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3362371865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjY3MTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE0NjU3MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjY3MTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE0NjU3MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young blade runner's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0331516/","name":"Ryan Gosling"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1869101/","name":"Ana de Armas"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898288/","name":"Denis Villeneuve"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054452/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001799/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266684/","name":"Hampton Fancher"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001140/","name":"Philip K.

I think the most impressive thing about it was its commitment to building on the mythology set forth by the original. It managed to expand on the original and give us answers to what happened to characters after it in ways that felt clever, fresh, and still faithful to it. It manages to be about the continuation of certain events in the first film while creating a new fascinating character at its core and manages to tell the new character's arc brilliantly. To reiterate, it's very well written, managing to avoid the clichés that usually transpire in films like this. Villeneuve has quickly become one of the best filmmakers currently working and this is only another example of his talent. However, the original was much better.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":513093,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-10-05","keywords":"female nudity,environmental damage,corporatist,capitalism,sex scene","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"At Cinemas Now","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3362371865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjY3MTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE0NjU3MzI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjY3MTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE0NjU3MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young blade runner's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0331516/","name":"Ryan Gosling","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1869101/","name":"Ana de Armas"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898288/","name":"Denis Villeneuve"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054452/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001799/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266684/","name":"Hampton Fancher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001140/","name":"Philip K.

For that reason alone, I think it's sort of impressive when one works really well. Supposed to hit theatres, but now streaming on-demand to rent, The High Note is the prime example of a story that feels tired but works really well anyways. I enjoy underdog films, but I'm always worried I'll be able to predict everything. Well, this movie was an absolute catch-22 and here's why.\n\nMaggie (Dakota Johnson), being overlooked by her superstar boss Grace Davis (Tracee Ellis Ross), works on the side, trying to make a name for herself after finding a very talented singer in David Cliff (Kelvin Harrison Jr.). The two of them find passion in their music together and eventually form a romance as well. Not only does this shine a light on the fact that her attention is being taken away from Davis, but it also may lead to a promising future for everyone involved. Through the many trials and tribulations that these films offer the audience, it can feel very formulaic, but I feel that it works very well, and that's due to the characters all being well-rounded.\n\nIt does help when your character is written well for you, but Dakota Johnson has been on a roll lately in terms of roles and performances. Before her work on Fifty Shades of Grey made her a household name as an actress, her small roles in The Social Network and Need for Speed always stood out to me more. Once she started broadening her career by appearing in smaller films like The Peanut Butter Falcon, The Friend, and now The High Note, I need to keep an eye out for all of her films. I believe she is becoming a great actress if she's not there already. On top of that, Kelvin Harrison Jr. through film like Monsters and Men and Waves has been on my radar as well. Their chemistry here was really enjoyable and it made the movie worthwhile in the end.\n\nNow, here's where some viewers may take issue. Like many horror films, romantic comedies, and thrillers about kidnapping people these days, stories like this will always feel a little been-there-done-that now. Yes, The High Note plays out exactly as you think it would, but there's a nice emotional backbone to the story and it came to fruition by the end of the run time. I rolled my eyes at a few instances while watching, but this was ultimately a really satisfying and fun movie to watch. Especially right now, I think movies like this need to be watched.\n\nIn the end, The High Note is the type of film that's absolutely harmless in nature. A feel-good story about a likeable character trying to find their way. In times like the ones we are living in right now, you can't ask for a nicer story to watch. Is it perfect? Definitely not, but I honestly think most viewers can find enjoyment in this one. The subject matter of music may not entice everyone, but there's more to the story than that. I recommend giving this one a rent if you're looking to smile and have a good time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9077,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-05-29","keywords":"recording session,reference to taylor swift,reference to the weeknd,reference to the beatles,reference to jerry wexler","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The High Note - Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1053998617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdiNDY3ZmMtZGY0NS00NGM2LWJjOWItNjZjNTFhZDg4YTljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdiNDY3ZmMtZGY0NS00NGM2LWJjOWItNjZjNTFhZDg4YTljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424848/","name":"Dakota Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0743896/","name":"Tracee Ellis Ross"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5123156/","name":"Kelvin Harrison Jr."}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0304091/","name":"Nisha Ganatra"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346224/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5958525/","name":"Flora Greeson"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

For that reason alone, I think it's sort of impressive when one works really well. Supposed to hit theatres, but now streaming on-demand to rent, The High Note is the prime example of a story that feels tired but works really well anyways. I enjoy underdog films, but I'm always worried I'll be able to predict everything. Well, this movie was an absolute catch-22 and here's why.\n\nMaggie (Dakota Johnson), being overlooked by her superstar boss Grace Davis (Tracee Ellis Ross), works on the side, trying to make a name for herself after finding a very talented singer in David Cliff (Kelvin Harrison Jr.). The two of them find passion in their music together and eventually form a romance as well. Not only does this shine a light on the fact that her attention is being taken away from Davis, but it also may lead to a promising future for everyone involved. Through the many trials and tribulations that these films offer the audience, it can feel very formulaic, but I feel that it works very well, and that's due to the characters all being well-rounded.\n\nIt does help when your character is written well for you, but Dakota Johnson has been on a roll lately in terms of roles and performances. Before her work on Fifty Shades of Grey made her a household name as an actress, her small roles in The Social Network and Need for Speed always stood out to me more. Once she started broadening her career by appearing in smaller films like The Peanut Butter Falcon, The Friend, and now The High Note, I need to keep an eye out for all of her films. I believe she is becoming a great actress if she's not there already. On top of that, Kelvin Harrison Jr. through film like Monsters and Men and Waves has been on my radar as well. Their chemistry here was really enjoyable and it made the movie worthwhile in the end.\n\nNow, here's where some viewers may take issue. Like many horror films, romantic comedies, and thrillers about kidnapping people these days, stories like this will always feel a little been-there-done-that now. Yes, The High Note plays out exactly as you think it would, but there's a nice emotional backbone to the story and it came to fruition by the end of the run time. I rolled my eyes at a few instances while watching, but this was ultimately a really satisfying and fun movie to watch. Especially right now, I think movies like this need to be watched.\n\nIn the end, The High Note is the type of film that's absolutely harmless in nature. A feel-good story about a likeable character trying to find their way. In times like the ones we are living in right now, you can't ask for a nicer story to watch. Is it perfect? Definitely not, but I honestly think most viewers can find enjoyment in this one. The subject matter of music may not entice everyone, but there's more to the story than that. I recommend giving this one a rent if you're looking to smile and have a good time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9077,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-05-29","keywords":"recording session,reference to taylor swift,reference to the weeknd,reference to the beatles,reference to jerry wexler","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The High Note - Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1053998617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdiNDY3ZmMtZGY0NS00NGM2LWJjOWItNjZjNTFhZDg4YTljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdiNDY3ZmMtZGY0NS00NGM2LWJjOWItNjZjNTFhZDg4YTljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424848/","name":"Dakota Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0743896/","name":"Tracee Ellis Ross","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5123156/","name":"Kelvin Harrison Jr."],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0304091/","name":"Nisha Ganatra"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346224/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5958525/","name":"Flora Greeson"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.\n\nEvery single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.\n\nOverall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.\n\nPawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.\n\nHervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.\n\nThe scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.\n\nGreat film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":777302,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.5},"contentRating":"(Banned)","genre":["Biography","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2002-09-25","keywords":"pianist,holocaust,survival,nazi occupied poland,person in a wheelchair falls from height","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Pianist","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi988938521","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ4MWQzNDEtYmI4Zi00NmY0LWEwYTEtZTg4MmQ3MDM2YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmQ4MWQzNDEtYmI4Zi00NmY0LWEwYTEtZTg4MmQ3MDM2YmJlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Focus Features"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004778/","name":"Adrien Brody"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470981/","name":"Thomas Kretschmann"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0277975/","name":"Frank Finlay"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024473/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0030304/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053177/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0367838/","name":"Ronald Harwood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0844262/","name":"Wladyslaw Szpilman"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's not the most original or best film out there, but it was a romantic and beautiful story that was very delightful to watch.

Violette's view does bring some freshness to the movie.\n\nIt was a subtle comedy, at least by American standards, but it is very effective.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3971,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-10-28","keywords":"oedipal complex,breastfeeding a baby,breast feeding,breasts pulled out,paris france","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer for Lolo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi53064473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDY1MzcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE5MTQ3NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDY1MzcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE5MTQ3NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A film by Julie Delpy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200702/","name":"Dany Boon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3228320/","name":"Vincent Lacoste"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170513/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0261946/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3032208/","name":"Eugénie Grandval"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's more of a drama / thriller movie and within those genres it works very well. Drew Barrymore did an excellent job, she played two roles, this depressed, overwhelmed woman with severe problems and on the other hand there is this other character, who at first seems to be a happy girl with problems but innocent, although little by little she is showing her true essence. So if you are going to see this movie, I recommend you not to see it as a comedy, because you will not find jokes, funny scenes, etc. See this movie for what it is, a drama with touches of thriller. And I repeat, Drew Barrymore really did an excellent job here!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2980,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-12-11","keywords":"actress","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3136274713","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhmMGVhMzktMjQwNC00YWIyLWI0ZWEtMzU0ODQzNjcwOWU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhmMGVhMzktMjQwNC00YWIyLWI0ZWEtMzU0ODQzNjcwOWU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When ordered to serve a year in rehab, actress Candy (Drew Barrymore) hires her on set stand-in to take her place.

It's more of a drama / thriller movie and within those genres it works very well. Drew Barrymore did an excellent job, she played two roles, this depressed, overwhelmed woman with severe problems and on the other hand there is this other character, who at first seems to be a happy girl with problems but innocent, although little by little she is showing her true essence. So if you are going to see this movie, I recommend you not to see it as a comedy, because you will not find jokes, funny scenes, etc. See this movie for what it is, a drama with touches of thriller. And I repeat, Drew Barrymore really did an excellent job here!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2980,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-12-11","keywords":"actress","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3136274713","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhmMGVhMzktMjQwNC00YWIyLWI0ZWEtMzU0ODQzNjcwOWU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhmMGVhMzktMjQwNC00YWIyLWI0ZWEtMzU0ODQzNjcwOWU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When ordered to serve a year in rehab, actress Candy (Drew Barrymore) hires her on set stand-in to take her place.

To begin with, the farm's owners neither want nor need a custodian. Then his solitude is broken by one of his former students, a young girl who's had it with her materialistic parents. And by some con artists, some cyclists, at least one self-proclaimed poet, the girl's parents, the farm's owners, and ultimately the police. So much for lazy-ing around in the hazy countryside.

Andrzej Jaminowski, 87 m. When Jasiak, a retired school teacher, decides to act as custodian of a deserted farm in the Polish countryside, he finds the easy life more than he bargained for. To begin with, the farm's owners neither want nor need a custodian. Then his solitude is broken by one of his former students, a young girl who's had it with her materialistic parents. And by some con artists, some cyclists, at least one self-proclaimed poet, the girl's parents, the farm's owners, and ultimately the police. So much for lazy-ing around in the hazy countryside. You might call Squint Your Eyes a provocative, philosophical comedy.Nick Salerno","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":898,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2003-10-24","keywords":"farm,ex teacher,rural setting,unemployment,isolation","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0952498/","name":"Zbigniew Zamachowski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1437136/","name":"Olga Prószynska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435653/","name":"Rafal Guzniczak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109608/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109606/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0126437/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

When she feels a genre hasn't been explored to its full potential, she takes it further. When she notices women her age are typecast in boring roles, she writes her own. She's a visionary filmmaker with something to say and the talent and ambition to make sure she's heard - her second collaboration with director and co- writer Zal Batmanglij, The East, is no exception, and is perhaps the peak of her already illustrious career so far. \n\nThe film follows Jane Owen (Marling), an undercover security agent, as she leaves behind her doting boyfriend (Jason Ritter) to infiltrate an eco-terrorist group known as The East, who have publicly targeted massive corporations for their covered-up crimes against humans and nature. In between reports to her icy, amoral boss (Patricia Clarkson), Jane slowly grows fascinated with the group, its morals and goals, and its core (Alexander Skarsgard, Ellen Page, Shiloh Fernandez, Toby Kebbell), observing with a mix of horror and infatuation as they execute their violent "jams" on the corporations' key members. \n\nThe East will inevitably draw comparisons to Sean Durkin's Martha Marcy May Marlene because of the subject matter and its ingenue leading lady.The East is not as much of a psychological profile, but there are interesting similarities - like Durkin, Batmanglij and Marling never really villainize or condemn their subects; instead, they make a point of showing the East's appeal. We, the audience, begin to understand why these troubled young people would find solace and purpose in what is essentially a band of guerrilla terrorists, and, in turn, why Jane is so hypnotized by them. It makes for an uncomfortably provocative watch: as we learn more about the characters, their backgrounds, and the corporations' crimes (which are based in fact), it's hard to determine who the "bad guys" are. I saw the film at a festival where Batmanglij gave a short Q&amp;A after and he revealed that he, Marling, and Page had lived with similar groups (without the terrorism) before and were sympathetic with the East's cause, if not their methods. The sympathy shows in the writing and most of the time that's a good thing, but there are times when it gets closer to bias and muddies otherwise brilliant storytelling - but these are blips in the overall outstanding product. \n\nMarling is, as always, enigmatic and hypnotizing, but she is an observer and lets the other characters do the talking; it takes highly skilled actors to command empathy for villains and the cast doesn't disappoint. Alexander Skarsgard is incredibly charismatic and persuasive, and he fills in the blanks admirably whenever his development is cut short. Patricia Clarkson surprises in an unusual role for her - she hints that her character might be more evil than any of the terrorists she is hunting. Jason Ritter and Hillary Baack are affecting in their small roles, and Julia Ormond dominates her five minutes of screen time - her last scene is perhaps the most haunting in the film. Ellen Page gives a career-best performances and reminds us that she's a force to be reckoned with if only she were given the chance to show off more often. She commands the screen with intimidating animosity from the second she walks on screen and has some genuinely heartbreaking moments later on. \n\nIn spite of occasional misfires, the screenplay is exceptional especially in its efficiency: there is so much going on that there isn't much time to devote to individual characters or relationships - Marling and Ritter's suffers the most - but Marling and Batmanglij make every second count as each line is weighted with enough subtext to tell us the stories implicitly and thoroughly nevertheless. The major characters are very well-drawn; even though we only get glimpses into Skarsgard, Page and Kebbell's pasts, we feel we know them inside and out. The film moves along at a fluid, adrenaline-pumping pace and the tension is genuine and organic rather than forced - the audience's investment in the story grows from affection for the characters and connection with their ideals rather than cheap editing tricks, manipulative music and stylized lighting or sound. Music is used so sparsely that when The National's "About Today" plays over a silent montage of Marling's character breaking down, its emotional weight surprises and stuns. The ending is comparatively underwhelming, but the overall package is one of the best, most provocative thrillers in years and firmly establishes Batmanglij and Marling as a sensational and important pairing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":49676,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-06-28","keywords":"anarchist,ecoterrorism,environmental crime,nude swimming,male nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Version","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2067179033","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxMzg2NjU0OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODYzNzM0OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"An operative for an elite private intelligence firm finds her priorities irrevocably changed after she is tasked with infiltrating an anarchist group known for executing covert attacks upon major corporations.

    <title lang="pl">Miasta rytm: Zrabowane dzieła sztuki</title>
    <desc lang="pl">W trakcie II wojny światowej z Polski zniknęły setki tysięcy bezcennych dzieł sztuki. Zarówno niemieccy, jak i radzieccy okupanci masowo wywozili obrazy i rzeźby. Nie wszystkie udało się odzyskać. Obecnie wiele z tych polskich zbiorów rozsianych jest po całym świecie. Historyk sztuki Jerzy S. Majewski przybliża losy tych zrabowanych dóbr. Snuje opowieść o skradzionym dorobku wielu wspaniałych artystów i wyjaśnia, co się z nim dokładnie stało.</desc>

It was good to see what felt like a truthful docu-drama.\n\nAnd as my son said at the end of part 3, 'well, that was emotional.'","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4401,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-06-14","keywords":"poisoning,salisbury wiltshire,year 2018,nerve agent,british police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1245863/","name":"Rafe Spall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240359/","name":"Anne-Marie Duff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2118257/","name":"Annabel Scholey"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0645108/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2779562265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNlNGI3NzMtZDRkMC00MjdkLTgwYTUtY2ViZDcwYjJlMDJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNlNGI3NzMtZDRkMC00MjdkLTgwYTUtY2ViZDcwYjJlMDJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In March 2018, the eyes of the world turned to the British city of Salisbury when it became the epicenter of what has been described as one of the biggest political events of the 21st century -- but until now, the heroic acts behind the headlines have not been told. Within three days of the assassination attempt on double agent and spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, key agencies discovered that a lethal nerve agent called Novichok was used, just half a teaspoon of which could kill 20,000 people. Within four days, hundreds of traces were found across the city, and, just when things were finally thought to be under control, a perfume bottle containing the nerve agent was discovered, throwing the investigation into renewed chaos."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">Damian Urbańczyk wprowadza widzów w tajniki rynku nieruchomości i radzi, na co zwrócić uwagę kupując mieszkanie. Prowadzący wyjaśni m.in. zjawisko o nazwie house flipping. To sposób inwestowania, który wymaga wolnych zasobów gotówki i wiedzy w zakresie budownictwa. Polega na tym, by znaleźć lokal w niskiej cenie i po przeprowadzeniu remontu sprzedać go z zyskiem.</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">Damian Urbańczyk wprowadza widzów w tajniki rynku nieruchomości i radzi, na co zwrócić uwagę kupując mieszkanie. Prowadzący wyjaśni m.in. zjawisko o nazwie house flipping. To sposób inwestowania, który wymaga wolnych zasobów gotówki i wiedzy w zakresie budownictwa. Polega na tym, by znaleźć lokal w niskiej cenie i po przeprowadzeniu remontu sprzedać go z zyskiem.</desc>

I'll occasionally pick an obscure title with a no-name cast to watch when no other decent titles are out. And sometimes some of them are half-way watchable. But this title had me rolling my eyes five minutes in. \n\nSo I experimented and started muting the sound and turned on sound bites from various stand-up routines.

For that reason alone, I think it's sort of impressive when one works really well. Supposed to hit theatres, but now streaming on-demand to rent, The High Note is the prime example of a story that feels tired but works really well anyways. I enjoy underdog films, but I'm always worried I'll be able to predict everything. Well, this movie was an absolute catch-22 and here's why.\n\nMaggie (Dakota Johnson), being overlooked by her superstar boss Grace Davis (Tracee Ellis Ross), works on the side, trying to make a name for herself after finding a very talented singer in David Cliff (Kelvin Harrison Jr.). The two of them find passion in their music together and eventually form a romance as well. Not only does this shine a light on the fact that her attention is being taken away from Davis, but it also may lead to a promising future for everyone involved. Through the many trials and tribulations that these films offer the audience, it can feel very formulaic, but I feel that it works very well, and that's due to the characters all being well-rounded.\n\nIt does help when your character is written well for you, but Dakota Johnson has been on a roll lately in terms of roles and performances. Before her work on Fifty Shades of Grey made her a household name as an actress, her small roles in The Social Network and Need for Speed always stood out to me more. Once she started broadening her career by appearing in smaller films like The Peanut Butter Falcon, The Friend, and now The High Note, I need to keep an eye out for all of her films. I believe she is becoming a great actress if she's not there already. On top of that, Kelvin Harrison Jr. through film like Monsters and Men and Waves has been on my radar as well. Their chemistry here was really enjoyable and it made the movie worthwhile in the end.\n\nNow, here's where some viewers may take issue. Like many horror films, romantic comedies, and thrillers about kidnapping people these days, stories like this will always feel a little been-there-done-that now. Yes, The High Note plays out exactly as you think it would, but there's a nice emotional backbone to the story and it came to fruition by the end of the run time. I rolled my eyes at a few instances while watching, but this was ultimately a really satisfying and fun movie to watch. Especially right now, I think movies like this need to be watched.\n\nIn the end, The High Note is the type of film that's absolutely harmless in nature. A feel-good story about a likeable character trying to find their way. In times like the ones we are living in right now, you can't ask for a nicer story to watch. Is it perfect? Definitely not, but I honestly think most viewers can find enjoyment in this one. The subject matter of music may not entice everyone, but there's more to the story than that. I recommend giving this one a rent if you're looking to smile and have a good time.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9077,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-05-29","keywords":"recording session,reference to taylor swift,reference to the weeknd,reference to the beatles,reference to jerry wexler","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The High Note - Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1053998617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdiNDY3ZmMtZGY0NS00NGM2LWJjOWItNjZjNTFhZDg4YTljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODdiNDY3ZmMtZGY0NS00NGM2LWJjOWItNjZjNTFhZDg4YTljXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424848/","name":"Dakota Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0743896/","name":"Tracee Ellis Ross"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5123156/","name":"Kelvin Harrison Jr."}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0304091/","name":"Nisha Ganatra"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0346224/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057311/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5958525/","name":"Flora Greeson"}],"duration":"PT1H53M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.\n\nEvery single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.\n\nOverall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.\n\nPawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.\n\nHervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.\n\nThe scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.\n\nGreat film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars.

Overall, this isn't anything really new, but it's well made enough to keep you entertained.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8463,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2019-04-19","keywords":"singer,singing,bar singer,bar,horse","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3412245017","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUzYTJmNTItZGQ1Yi00Y2E0LWJkMDAtNDkwMjU2NDQ1MGY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTUzYTJmNTItZGQ1Yi00Y2E0LWJkMDAtNDkwMjU2NDQ1MGY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Violet (Elle Fanning) dreams of pop stardom to escape her small town and shattered family life.

A young man raised by a single mother does not like it when eligible suitors comes sniffing around his MILF. So when a IT tech becomes his mother's love interest, Lolo stops at nothing to break these two apart. \n\nThe french version of this story starts out as just a young man talking crap to convince his mom that this man is not right for her. Then it escalates to the extreme when Lolo makes The IT tech his victim. That's were the comedy comes it as well.\n\nIt's not different from an American comedy in how it escalates, except that the this french film realizes it does not need to got too over the top with the comedy to be laugh out loud funny. \n\nIf you ever seen such movie as Cyrus or Mr. Woodcock than you'll like this movie. It's the same style of comedy. \n\nOne exception is the focus on the perspective of Julie Delpy's character, Violette, a 40 year old woman who still in the dating game looking for love. I seen the movie done from Lolo's perspective as the selfish son who will do anything to keep the cord attached to his mother, and I've seen it from Jean-René's perceptive as a man dating a woman too good to be true, and then discovers she got some baggage she loves too much too see as baggage. Violette's view does bring some freshness to the movie.\n\nIt was a subtle comedy, at least by American standards, but it is very effective.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3971,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-10-28","keywords":"oedipal complex,breastfeeding a baby,breast feeding,breasts pulled out,paris france","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer for Lolo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi53064473","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDY1MzcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE5MTQ3NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDY1MzcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE5MTQ3NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A film by Julie Delpy"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200702/","name":"Dany Boon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3228320/","name":"Vincent Lacoste"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170513/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0261946/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3032208/","name":"Eugénie Grandval"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Lolo: Directed by Julie Delpy. With Dany Boon, Julie Delpy, Vincent Lacoste, Karin Viard.

A young man raised by a single mother does not like it when eligible suitors comes sniffing around his MILF. So when a IT tech becomes his mother's love interest, Lolo stops at nothing to break these two apart. \n\nThe french version of this story starts out as just a young man talking crap to convince his mom that this man is not right for her. Then it escalates to the extreme when Lolo makes The IT tech his victim. That's were the comedy comes it as well.\n\nIt's not different from an American comedy in how it escalates, except that the this french film realizes it does not need to got too over the top with the comedy to be laugh out loud funny. \n\nIf you ever seen such movie as Cyrus or Mr. Woodcock than you'll like this movie. It's the same style of comedy. \n\nOne exception is the focus on the perspective of Julie Delpy's character, Violette, a 40 year old woman who still in the dating game looking for love. I seen the movie done from Lolo's perspective as the selfish son who will do anything to keep the cord attached to his mother, and I've seen it from Jean-René's perceptive as a man dating a woman too good to be true, and then discovers she got some baggage she loves too much too see as baggage. Violette's view does bring some freshness to the movie.\n\nIt was a subtle comedy, at least by American standards, but it is very effective.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3971,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-10-28","keywords":"oedipal complex,breastfeeding a baby,breast feeding,breasts pulled out,paris france","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer for Lolo","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi53064473","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDY1MzcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE5MTQ3NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDY1MzcyMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE5MTQ3NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A film by Julie Delpy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200702/","name":"Dany Boon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3228320/","name":"Vincent Lacoste"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0170513/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056755/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0261946/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000365/","name":"Julie Delpy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3032208/","name":"Eugénie Grandval"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This film is so beautifully made and is very touching and moving. The story follows the young Syrian Omar (Amir El-Masry) who ends up in a remote Scottish island until he finds out if he's granted asylum. He lives with three other immigrants from other nationalities and they live in a small house in the middle of nowhere, while they attend cultural awareness sessions to develop their social skills. Omar doesn't say much, but his eyes says it all. He feels alone and out of place, while he's an aspiring musician who plays the oud, he never played since he left Syria, and due to a hand injury he remains unable to play. He calls his parents over the phone, where they tell him about their struggle as well, as they live in Turkey, while his brother Nabil remains in Syria to fight for his country. Omar feels that he's not good enough as his brave brother who wasn't afraid to stay in his war-torn country, while he's haunted by his father's words who keeps reminding him " a musician who doesn't play, is a dead man". Omar struggles with his memories of his life with his family back home, where they used to grow apricots and sing old songs, and he used to play oud in front of audience. But now he just wanders the open roads and fields, and he just talks with his roommate Farhad, who's been waiting for more than two years for his asylum claim. Omar walks everywhere with his oud case which was given to him by his grandfather, maybe because he doesn't want to lose it, as it's the only thing he has left that reminds him of his old life. The film has a lot of other moving stories related to the other immigrants and Omar's relationship with his brother, as all of them highlight how cruel it is for any refugee who's forced to leave his country and venture into the unknown, while leaving his loved ones behind and facing a world he doesn't recognize or belong to. The writer and director Ben Sharrock was able to capture the inner feelings of an Arab in a foreign country, and the Cinematography of the vast landscape with very beautiful. Also the depiction of Arab songs was lovely especially the song in the end titles by Magda El Romi. This is one of those rare films that is so human and it's brilliance lies in its simplicity yet it has such great emotional depth. Finally Amir El-Masry is such a talented actor, who could be the next Rami Malek, who knows.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2119,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-07-30","keywords":"one word title,musician as protagonist,separation from family,musician,scottish island","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2474754073","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q2ODMxMDYtODMzYi00MzIzLWJiMjYtZDVmMTlhZjlhZjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2Q2ODMxMDYtODMzYi00MzIzLWJiMjYtZDVmMTlhZjlhZjBjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Omar is a promising young musician.

Bank robber Frank Morris (Clint Eastwood) has tried too many escapes and is brought to Alcatraz where no one has ever escaped from. He befriends Litmus with his mouse and becomes Wolf's enemy. English (Paul Benjamin) runs the library. It turns out that English is the top among the blacks. Charley Butts moves into the next cell. Brothers Clarence Anglin and John Anglin (Fred Ward) join Frank in Alcatraz after a failed escape.\n\nIt's a nice prison movie with all the horrors that entails and an escape scheme. It's a bit slow and lacks a truly scary opponent. The warden is nothing special. Patrick McGoohan doesn't have enough threatening presence. Wolf is too soft and goes away for much of the movie. I wish more is done with the antagonists of the movie. Nevertheless, it's a good escape movie. Clint is at the top of his game.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":128098,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Biography","Crime"],"datePublished":"1979-06-22","keywords":"escape,prison,island,prison island,1960s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4045127193","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E5NjhiNWYtNThmYy00ZTA1LTg4ZWMtMWQ3YzA3NWFiMjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E5NjhiNWYtNThmYy00ZTA1LTg4ZWMtMWQ3YzA3NWFiMjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001526/","name":"Patrick McGoohan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089348/","name":"Roberts Blossom"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0796923/","name":"Don Siegel"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102264/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115431/","name":"J.

Bank robber Frank Morris (Clint Eastwood) has tried too many escapes and is brought to Alcatraz where no one has ever escaped from. He befriends Litmus with his mouse and becomes Wolf's enemy. English (Paul Benjamin) runs the library. It turns out that English is the top among the blacks. Charley Butts moves into the next cell. Brothers Clarence Anglin and John Anglin (Fred Ward) join Frank in Alcatraz after a failed escape.\n\nIt's a nice prison movie with all the horrors that entails and an escape scheme. It's a bit slow and lacks a truly scary opponent. The warden is nothing special. Patrick McGoohan doesn't have enough threatening presence. Wolf is too soft and goes away for much of the movie. I wish more is done with the antagonists of the movie. Nevertheless, it's a good escape movie. Clint is at the top of his game.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":128098,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Biography","Crime"],"datePublished":"1979-06-22","keywords":"escape,prison,island,prison island,1960s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4045127193","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E5NjhiNWYtNThmYy00ZTA1LTg4ZWMtMWQ3YzA3NWFiMjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2E5NjhiNWYtNThmYy00ZTA1LTg4ZWMtMWQ3YzA3NWFiMjA3XkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000142/","name":"Clint Eastwood","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001526/","name":"Patrick McGoohan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0089348/","name":"Roberts Blossom"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0796923/","name":"Don Siegel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0102264/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0115431/","name":"J.

Here, mad man Maximilian Largo steals two American nuclear warheads and demands millions of dollars in ransom from the world leaders. As a result, MI6 reactivates their "00" agents and James Bond comes out of retirement to carry on the mission.\n\nArmed with secret weapons and an armor of one-liners, Connery still shines once again as the suave 007, though, he does look rather emotionless and mellow portraying his character at times. There is lesser action in this movie than in previous Bond films, but some of the the thrills are still a little entertaining, especially the part where Bond attempts to dispatch the femme fatale Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera).\n\nSorely missing is John Berry's iconic James Bond theme and score, and what we have instead is a very 80s-sounding soundtrack from Michel Legrand. The acting was just OK for the most part - Connery had some good chemistry with the Bond Girls, but much of the other cast members were forgettable. Max von Sydow gave a mediocre performance as Blofeld, Edward Fox gave a very overzealous and pompous portrayal of M and Rowan Atkinson gave a rather unfunny role as Small-Fawcett. Klaus Maria Brandauer gave a convincing villain in Maximilian Largo - slimy and sly, making you want to punch him in the face.\n\nThe film its adventurous moments, but, it's not one of the best Bond movies out there - it's more like a stand alone action flick.\n\nGrade C+","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65450,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1983-10-07","keywords":"unofficial sequel,james bond character,tough girl,gun violence,spy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Never Say Never Again","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1906574617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYyYzlhNDktYTM1OS00YzI3LWIxZDUtYTA2MTA1NzI5NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYyYzlhNDktYTM1OS00YzI3LWIxZDUtYTA2MTA1NzI5NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from MGM/UA"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000107/","name":"Kim Basinger"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001970/","name":"Klaus Maria Brandauer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0449984/","name":"Irvin Kershner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033675/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078552/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035468/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565886/","name":"Kevin McClory"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926525/","name":"Jack Whittingham"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"}],"duration":"PT2H14M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Here, mad man Maximilian Largo steals two American nuclear warheads and demands millions of dollars in ransom from the world leaders. As a result, MI6 reactivates their "00" agents and James Bond comes out of retirement to carry on the mission.\n\nArmed with secret weapons and an armor of one-liners, Connery still shines once again as the suave 007, though, he does look rather emotionless and mellow portraying his character at times. There is lesser action in this movie than in previous Bond films, but some of the the thrills are still a little entertaining, especially the part where Bond attempts to dispatch the femme fatale Fatima Blush (Barbara Carrera).\n\nSorely missing is John Berry's iconic James Bond theme and score, and what we have instead is a very 80s-sounding soundtrack from Michel Legrand. The acting was just OK for the most part - Connery had some good chemistry with the Bond Girls, but much of the other cast members were forgettable. Max von Sydow gave a mediocre performance as Blofeld, Edward Fox gave a very overzealous and pompous portrayal of M and Rowan Atkinson gave a rather unfunny role as Small-Fawcett. Klaus Maria Brandauer gave a convincing villain in Maximilian Largo - slimy and sly, making you want to punch him in the face.\n\nThe film its adventurous moments, but, it's not one of the best Bond movies out there - it's more like a stand alone action flick.\n\nGrade C+","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":65450,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1983-10-07","keywords":"unofficial sequel,james bond character,tough girl,gun violence,spy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Never Say Never Again","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1906574617","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYyYzlhNDktYTM1OS00YzI3LWIxZDUtYTA2MTA1NzI5NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzYyYzlhNDktYTM1OS00YzI3LWIxZDUtYTA2MTA1NzI5NzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from MGM/UA","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000125/","name":"Sean Connery","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000107/","name":"Kim Basinger","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001970/","name":"Klaus Maria Brandauer"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0449984/","name":"Irvin Kershner"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033675/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078552/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0035468/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565886/","name":"Kevin McClory","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926525/","name":"Jack Whittingham","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001220/","name":"Ian Fleming"],"duration":"PT2H14M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The film opens slowly and my wife nearly lost interest before the story engrossed her. Perhaps given my "country cousin" roots, I was immediately taken in. As a writer I was astounded at how many times I could not predict what would happen next. Yet, every scene flows naturally into the next.\n\nWhile I found some of the dialog unintelligible, the "natural sound" so accentuated the film's atmosphere I didn't care. Certainly, I had no trouble understanding all the necessary interchanges.\n\nWhile all performances are "pitch perfect," Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes certainly deserved their Oscar nominations and numerous awards. Likewise, writer/director deserved her Oscar nomination for writing. She should have received one for directing. In any event, she is one to watch and, in my opinion, a much better director than Oscar winner Kathryn Bigelow.\n\nThere are no really "big" messages here. Nonetheless the "small" messages of humanity,community and personal honor shine like a beacon. I give "Winter's Bone" a "10"."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139844,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-07-16","keywords":"ozark mountains,family relationships,drug trade,family crisis,search for father","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winter's Bone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3239184153","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MTg3OTQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MTg3OTQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"17 year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) sets out to track down her father, who put their house up for his bail bond and then disappeared.

The film opens slowly and my wife nearly lost interest before the story engrossed her. Perhaps given my "country cousin" roots, I was immediately taken in. As a writer I was astounded at how many times I could not predict what would happen next. Yet, every scene flows naturally into the next.\n\nWhile I found some of the dialog unintelligible, the "natural sound" so accentuated the film's atmosphere I didn't care. Certainly, I had no trouble understanding all the necessary interchanges.\n\nWhile all performances are "pitch perfect," Jennifer Lawrence and John Hawkes certainly deserved their Oscar nominations and numerous awards. Likewise, writer/director deserved her Oscar nomination for writing. She should have received one for directing. In any event, she is one to watch and, in my opinion, a much better director than Oscar winner Kathryn Bigelow.\n\nThere are no really "big" messages here. Nonetheless the "small" messages of humanity,community and personal honor shine like a beacon. I give "Winter's Bone" a "10".","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139844,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2010-07-16","keywords":"ozark mountains,family relationships,drug trade,family crisis,search for father","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winter's Bone","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3239184153","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MTg3OTQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0MTg3OTQzNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjMxMTczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"17 year-old Ree Dolly (Jennifer Lawrence) sets out to track down her father, who put their house up for his bail bond and then disappeared.

New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.\n\nI'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.\n\nVALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).\n\nTom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...\n\nWhat makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.\n\nIt is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.\n\nIf the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that "I was on the edge of my seat" throughout the second half of the film.\n\nSo if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-01-21","keywords":"national socialism,near miss,dilettantism,incompetence,20 july plot","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Valkyrie: Featurette -- "Through Bryan Singer's Eyes"","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3544383513","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODczMTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODczMTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Valkyrie: Featurette -- "Through Bryan Singer's Eyes""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0631490/","name":"Bill Nighy"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0396924/","name":"Carice van Houten"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001741/","name":"Bryan Singer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057712/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1267492/","name":"Nathan Alexander"}],"duration":"PT2H1M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

New York Press The above is the usual negative commentary you'll see regarding this film. Critics bashed it for being insulting, unoriginal, and unmoving. Let me make some corrections for them so that they can save a little face.\n\nI'm no Tom Cruise fan. A buddy of mine, too, is so peeved at Cruise that he refuses to watch anything the man stars in. Mostly this has to do with Cruise's personal life and beliefs (just watch an episode of South Park to see how some people view him and you'll see what I mean). People have similar feelings toward Mel Gibson ...but I digress.\n\nVALKYRIE, as most of you probably now know, is the final of 15 attempts on Hitler's life. Shortly after this (about nine months) he committed suicide in his bunker. But this is about the one time where it almost succeeded. I'd heard about this attempt and read bits of it in history classes, but never really gave it much thought. I mean, the mustachioed murderer offed himself, so that was that. But what gives this film much of its umpf! is how true to history the story sticks (that and how closely many of the actors resemble their true-life counterparts). It is also riveting coming from director Bryan Singer (who did one of my all-time favorite films, THE USUAL SUSPECTS).\n\nTom Cruise did a great job (probably one of his best since COLLATERAL and MINORITY REPORT). His Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg character was spot-on ...with one exception that seems to be a sticking point for many: his accent. It is true that none of the actors attempts a German cadence in their speech. Did this bother me? No. I think it would have bothered me if they'd TRIED to do one and made it sound forced or ridiculous. So there's that...\n\nWhat makes the film a success was Cruise's rock solid performance and the amazing supporting cast: Kenneth Branagh, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson, Terrence Stamp, and Eddie Izzard just to sprinkle a few names.\n\nIt is also noteworthy to mention that they filmed nearly everything on-location and in the exact same spots where the original incidents took place, including the subsequent trials and executions of the conspirators. Phenomenal authenticity.\n\nIf the cadence of their speech bothered some, then I failed to see how the cadence of the film could. It was absolutely perfect. It gradually built up suspense (even though we knew how it would end for the conspirators), and never slowed, right up until the very end. I am forced to use a cliché here in that "I was on the edge of my seat" throughout the second half of the film.\n\nSo if you're looking to tear apart Tom Cruise, you might look at WAR OF THE WORLDS or LEGEND. But not here.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":235855,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-01-21","keywords":"national socialism,near miss,dilettantism,incompetence,20 july plot","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Valkyrie: Featurette -- "Through Bryan Singer's Eyes"","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3544383513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODczMTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQxODczMTg5Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE0NTYyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Valkyrie: Featurette -- "Through Bryan Singer's Eyes"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0631490/","name":"Bill Nighy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0396924/","name":"Carice van Houten"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001741/","name":"Bryan Singer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0057712/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003160/","name":"Christopher McQuarrie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1267492/","name":"Nathan Alexander"],"duration":"PT2H1M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Anyone familiar with some of Del Toro's other work will see a lot of his signature visual touches, which is far from being a bad thing, and the design of the ghosts was refreshingly innovative and blended into the overall visual style. The plot is interesting once it gets going, however slightly predictable. \n\nSadly, there are some noticeable downsides. The most obvious one is how slowly this film starts, with seemingly very little happening for the first twenty or so minutes. The focus is very heavily on the plot, and while some characters are developed more slowly because it ties in with the plot, others can feel underdeveloped. When this is combined with the slow start, it makes the first part of this film fairly boring. Some of the chronology of this film can seem slightly strange as well, when scrutinised. \n\nHowever, despite its faults, this is still a good film and worth watching. 7/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"incest,ghost,gothic,loss of mother,haunted mansion","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi924626969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1OTQ4ODgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjUwNTAwNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1OTQ4ODgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjUwNTAwNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the aftermath of a family tragedy, an aspiring author is torn between love for her childhood friend and the temptation of a mysterious outsider.

Anyone familiar with some of Del Toro's other work will see a lot of his signature visual touches, which is far from being a bad thing, and the design of the ghosts was refreshingly innovative and blended into the overall visual style. The plot is interesting once it gets going, however slightly predictable. \n\nSadly, there are some noticeable downsides. The most obvious one is how slowly this film starts, with seemingly very little happening for the first twenty or so minutes. The focus is very heavily on the plot, and while some characters are developed more slowly because it ties in with the plot, others can feel underdeveloped. When this is combined with the slow start, it makes the first part of this film fairly boring. Some of the chronology of this film can seem slightly strange as well, when scrutinised. \n\nHowever, despite its faults, this is still a good film and worth watching. 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":140545,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"incest,ghost,gothic,loss of mother,haunted mansion","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi924626969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1OTQ4ODgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjUwNTAwNjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU1OTQ4ODgxOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjUwNTAwNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the aftermath of a family tragedy, an aspiring author is torn between love for her childhood friend and the temptation of a mysterious outsider.

It seemed like the director wanted to show her husband's pack more than the character's addiction problems. Aaron Johnson made me feel insecure about my Johnson now. I thought it was fake. It was like watching Boogie Nights (1997) but without the prosthetic fact or a good story. I enjoyed this film, but I couldn't help having an existencial crisis about sizes after finishing it. Goddamnit that was some kick ass snake.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-06","keywords":"male full frontal nudity,title directed by female,shower,drugs,addiction","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"A Million Little Pieces","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3980442649","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjdhNGU1ZmMtMjVmNS00NjdmLWJkOTgtY2JkNzVkMDg4ZjY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjdhNGU1ZmMtMjVmNS00NjdmLWJkOTgtY2JkNzVkMDg4ZjY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1093951/","name":"Aaron Taylor-Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000671/","name":"Billy Bob Thornton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3747611/","name":"Odessa Young"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0853374/","name":"Sam Taylor-Johnson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0554532/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0583900/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1093951/","name":"Aaron Taylor-Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0853374/","name":"Sam Taylor-Johnson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0294580/","name":"James Frey"],"duration":"PT1H53M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is an almost forgotten film about a time and a youth nearly forgotten, as well. And I will say, as a writer, the novella that this film was based upon, "The Body" has and always will be the inspiration for my style of writing.\n\nFirst of all, I enjoy the title that was chosen for the film. "Stand By Me" fits what the characters in the story are facing.  I think that all who have seen this film will agree that the problems are all things that we can relate to.  All of us know someone like these characters. Most of us have met the boy down the road who had a brother with a bad name and a father with an alcohol problem, automatically being labeled as a "bad kid." And the boy with the military father, abusive and a little whacko. The fat kid, picked on and ridiculed for his weight.\n\nTo me, Gordy represents all of us. I found myself seeing a little of me in Gordy as I watched the film. I don't know if any one else shares this, but it was true. Gordy was not very strong, at first, and was not sure what he wanted, except to be with his friends. Still coping with the loss of his brother and the fact that his father was disrespectful to him, Gordy still stood up for what he believed in. And, in the end he surprised the characters and the viewers by standing up to the bullies that had plagued them all.\n\nThis film is certainly one of my top favorites. In fact, it lies in my top three, probably at #2 or #3. I feel that it is a film that everyone should see at some point in their life due to the fact it changes your look at youth and their trials. Few films are able to do that and I think that this one was an inspiration for others that will do the same in the future.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":382388,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"1986-08-22","keywords":"friendship,childhood,coming of age film,walking on train tracks,summertime","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Stand By Me","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2284829721","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1NmQ5YWUtMmU2OC00MzQ0LWE4YmYtYTFmNWM2ZmUxYWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzY1NmQ5YWUtMmU2OC00MzQ0LWE4YmYtYTFmNWM2ZmUxYWY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000696/","name":"Wil Wheaton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000203/","name":"River Phoenix"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000397/","name":"Corey Feldman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001661/","name":"Rob Reiner"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015549/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043140/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000175/","name":"Stephen King"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0317279/","name":"Raynold Gideon"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0262595/","name":"Bruce A.

That all makes for great drama, but it's not an exaggeration of the situation with U.S. health care.

Now, I'm always willing to give just about anything a try and judge for myself if something is good or not. I've certainly watched enough movies and shows that weren't nearly as bad as other critics made them out to be. I've also watched enough movies and shows that weren't nearly as good either.\n\nItunes had a "free episode" gimmick going with several new CBS shows. I guess CBS is trying to find a way to enhance their ratings. Perhaps they should focus on their racist decisions instead, such as giving Grace Park and Daniel Dae Kim inferior pay compared to the rest of the cast of Hawaii Five-O.\n\nNow, I've always liked Queen Latifah, but for this series, she's badly miscast. Even after watching the pilot episode, I just couldn't buy the fact that she's a former operative with "a special set of skills," which would almost certainly mean that she would have had to have been a member of special forces. Much of her dialogue exchange with Chris Noth is about "old times" on various missions. In short, we aren't given a plausible explanation that explains her skill set, especially given her age. By the way, only as of February 2020 has a woman been set to pass the Special Forces Qualification Course.\n\nThe writing isn't very good, which is evident in the overused number of times that cliched lines are given. Also, what is the point of blasting girlie hip-hop music everytime Latifah mixes it up?\n\nHowever, Latifah's performance is good, as is much of the rest of the cast. I also found her style of parenting refreshing as well.\n\nThe Equalizer would have been much more enjoyable had they focused on her intelligence of being able to out-think her opponents (which she does do a few times) and less on her--unbelievably--mixing it up like some Denzel Washington/Jason Bourne wannabe. In other words, make the show unique and give it its own identity instead of trying to imitate and copy everything that has already been done.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-02-07","keywords":"justice,fighter,woman warrior,action heroine,one woman army","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001451/","name":"Queen Latifah","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457796/","name":"Tory Kittles","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004965/","name":"Adam Goldberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022730/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0110950/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0448397/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0549256/","name":"Andrew W.

If you're a Star Wars geek this movie totally is for you. Basically it's a movie about Star Wars geeks made by Star Wars geeks for a target audience of Star Wars geeks. If you are not into all things Star Wars this movie may well miss the mark with you. And even the most rabid of Star Wars fans would have to concede that the movie is certainly not anything spectacular. It's fairly charming and reasonably amusing but never really riotously funny. But it works. More or less.\n\nThe movie is set in the autumn of 1998, a time before Jar Jar Binks had been foisted upon the world. Four friends, major Star Wars geeks all, decide to drive across the country, break into Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of The Phantom Menace. The major motivation for this journey is that one of the friends has cancer and will not live to see the movie released. But once that is established the cancer storyline is basically put on the back burner and this turns into a mostly predictable wacky road-trip comedy. Some of the wackiness works, some of it falls flat. There are a bunch of celebrity cameos thrown in, some of which are inspired and some of which are rather random and pointless. So it's a movie which has its ups and downs. But it's enjoyable more often than not and the movie breezes by in a nice, tight, well-paced 90 minutes.\n\nNone of the actors playing our gang of four really stand out in any memorable way. Dan Fogler's character is a little more outrageous than the others but that's about it. But the group works together well and they are ably supported by the varied cast of characters who pop up throughout. Seth Rogen's portrayal of a pimp is one of the standouts. Of course this ode to Star Wars fans wouldn't be complete without taking some shots at Trekkies. So there's room for another funny turn by an actor portraying Admiral Seasholtz, an uber-Trekkie. Who is the unrecognizable actor memorably bringing this character to life? You may have to wait until the closing credits roll to figure it out. And in this Star Wars geek universe there's room for one girl and Kristen Bell is both charming and funny in the role as her character gets swept along for the ride. Could the movie be a little more consistently funny? Most definitely. But the movie about Star Wars geeks will probably leave you with a smile on your face. Especially if you're a Star Wars geek yourself.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2009-02-13","keywords":"star wars fan film,blonde,princess lela bikini,white panties,scantily clad female","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fanboys","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3468690201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmODc3N2UtNzc0Ny00YWU4LTljYWEtMDNjNmQzNDJhY2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmODc3N2UtNzc0Ny00YWU4LTljYWEtMDNjNmQzNDJhY2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer: A group of anxious fans decide to break into Skywalker Ranch and steal an early print of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" for their friend who is suffering from cancer."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283945/","name":"Dan Fogler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059431/","name":"Jay Baruchel"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068338/","name":"Kristen Bell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1381100/","name":"Kyle Newman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148949/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0244605/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2094392/","name":"Ernest Cline"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1104057/","name":"Adam F.

If you're a Star Wars geek this movie totally is for you. Basically it's a movie about Star Wars geeks made by Star Wars geeks for a target audience of Star Wars geeks. If you are not into all things Star Wars this movie may well miss the mark with you. And even the most rabid of Star Wars fans would have to concede that the movie is certainly not anything spectacular. It's fairly charming and reasonably amusing but never really riotously funny. But it works. More or less.\n\nThe movie is set in the autumn of 1998, a time before Jar Jar Binks had been foisted upon the world. Four friends, major Star Wars geeks all, decide to drive across the country, break into Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of The Phantom Menace. The major motivation for this journey is that one of the friends has cancer and will not live to see the movie released. But once that is established the cancer storyline is basically put on the back burner and this turns into a mostly predictable wacky road-trip comedy. Some of the wackiness works, some of it falls flat. There are a bunch of celebrity cameos thrown in, some of which are inspired and some of which are rather random and pointless. So it's a movie which has its ups and downs. But it's enjoyable more often than not and the movie breezes by in a nice, tight, well-paced 90 minutes.\n\nNone of the actors playing our gang of four really stand out in any memorable way. Dan Fogler's character is a little more outrageous than the others but that's about it. But the group works together well and they are ably supported by the varied cast of characters who pop up throughout. Seth Rogen's portrayal of a pimp is one of the standouts. Of course this ode to Star Wars fans wouldn't be complete without taking some shots at Trekkies. So there's room for another funny turn by an actor portraying Admiral Seasholtz, an uber-Trekkie. Who is the unrecognizable actor memorably bringing this character to life? You may have to wait until the closing credits roll to figure it out. And in this Star Wars geek universe there's room for one girl and Kristen Bell is both charming and funny in the role as her character gets swept along for the ride. Could the movie be a little more consistently funny? Most definitely. But the movie about Star Wars geeks will probably leave you with a smile on your face. Especially if you're a Star Wars geek yourself.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":57869,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2009-02-13","keywords":"star wars fan film,blonde,princess lela bikini,white panties,scantily clad female","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fanboys","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3468690201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmODc3N2UtNzc0Ny00YWU4LTljYWEtMDNjNmQzNDJhY2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNThmODc3N2UtNzc0Ny00YWU4LTljYWEtMDNjNmQzNDJhY2QxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer: A group of anxious fans decide to break into Skywalker Ranch and steal an early print of "Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace" for their friend who is suffering from cancer.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283945/","name":"Dan Fogler","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0059431/","name":"Jay Baruchel","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0068338/","name":"Kristen Bell"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1381100/","name":"Kyle Newman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0150452/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0148949/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0244605/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2094392/","name":"Ernest Cline","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1104057/","name":"Adam F.

Now is that not what a kids film should be? Too many people out there think they are experts, just relax man and watch the movie.\n\nInstead of writing crap about every film, it's unfair as myself as a parent checked the reviews for this. I am pleased I ignored them as I have my suspicions about a lot of these reviewers. This is a long line now in poor reviews which turn out to be decent movies.

Violence and mayhem ensue after a hunter stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and more than two million dollars in cash near the Rio Grande." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0477348/","name":"No Country for Old Men","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjA5Njk3MjM4OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTc5MTE1MQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Violence and mayhem ensue after a hunter stumbles upon a drug deal gone wrong and more than two million dollars in cash near the Rio Grande.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0477348/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"DonFishies"},"dateCreated":"2007-11-26","inLanguage":"English","name":"A hauntingly flawed unconventional masterpiece","reviewBody":"Days after seeing it, I am still haunted by No Country for Old Men. There is just something so effectual and uncompromising about it, that mere words will only begin to skim the surface of the cinematic excellence on display.\n\nAt its most simplistic, the film is a game of cat and mouse. The mouse here is Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon two million in cash after a drug deal gone wrong, and takes it thinking nothing of it. He tries to cover his tracks, but ends up letting the group looking for the money, figure out his identity. The cat is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hit-man hired to find Moss and the money. But Chigurh is unconventional at best; he also happens to be bordering on mentally insane. And another man, a law man this time, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), is on the trail of both men as they criss-cross around Texas.\n\nRight up until its dénouement, the film is simply brilliant. Taut and thrilling, it blows right through the majority of its two hour runtime with ease. Even during moments of slowing down, the film stays right on track and never feels like it has run its course. It engages even when it appears that nothing is happening. The Coen Brothers truly crafted what appears at first glance to be a masterpiece, even if it is their first real shot at something that is not indelibly and inarguably their own. Even without reading Cormac McCarthy's novel, I know that the Coens have done it justice, even with their bitterly twisted and dark sense of humour scattered throughout the film.\n\nBut all of that comes to a standstill as the film concludes. The last twenty or so minutes feel like hours as the film wraps itself up, and it almost feels like these scenes belong to another movie entirely (one that borders on being pretentious and monotonous). I realize now that McCarthy's novel probably ends the same way, but it does not help provide closure to the fact that the movie is so break-neck paced right up until this happens. Its brilliance is shattered by what looks to be a series of tattered events thrown together to provide closure for all of the characters, alive or dead, and for its audience. It speaks volumes to the film's title, but it just does not feel satisfying compared to the rest of what we saw. Even with its enigmatic devices at play, I still cannot come to terms with how the film closes. It does haunt, and in a way, it may prove to be a significantly stronger ending as time rolls on. But as it stands now, it just feels weak.\n\nWhat is also a bit of a surprise, and only seems to appear as the film concludes, is the music. It is not so obvious at first, but the majority of the film is audibly shown with just the sounds the characters make and no background music to speak of. This element is brilliantly used, as it helps intensify every situation and makes the film downright terrifying in some cases. It just helps truly make the film come together, and only helps establish the quick pacing even more so. It was definitely a surprise, and one that will probably help the lasting impact of the film become even stronger.\n\nThe lush and bloodsoaked visuals also help to define the film. Despite the film taking place mainly in deserted areas, or the desert itself, the camera manages to capture just the right essence of what the writing and acting is conveying. The isolation and the terror almost become characters themselves through these visuals, and are sure to be recognized as the award season rolls in.\n\nThe film's acting is also very well done. Brolin anchors the film and even when it is just the audience reacting to his attempts at saving his life, he manages to deliver the best performance of his career. He breathes life into Moss, and truly brings a sense of pathos to the character. We feel for him and his greedy mistake, and as he develops into a man unwilling to go down without a fight, he only manages to up the ante for himself countlessly. Jones, as the law man stuck on the fringe of every event, also does very well for himself. Most of his work is simply delivering dialogue, but it is delivered in such a fashionable sense that you feel like he is speaking to the bigger picture of things, and not just himself. I would have liked a bit more development in his character, but what little there is helps his performance greatly.\n\nSupporting turns from Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald are also done well, but are overshadowed by the main cast by both Brolin and Jones.\n\nAnd even more of an overcast is Bardem as the ruthless Chigurh. He absolutely nails this character down to his very bones. If anyone is merely toying with the idea of seeing the film, it should be specifically for Bardem. His performance is calculating and plagued with petrifying silence. When he chooses to talk, his words sound like they are being given by the essence of evil. This is a man with a plan, but it is one that only belongs to him. His enigmatic presence is developed throughout the film, and never once does it feel particularly appropriate to understand where this menace comes from. Watching him on screen is a jolt to the heart, and will go down as one of the best performances of the decade. His terrible hair only helps to make his character that more scary and formidable.\n\nNo Country for Old Men is one of the best pictures of the year, even if it is flawed. Its brilliance and lasting impact with leave you haunted.\n\n8.5/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":909170,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-04-02","keywords":"sheriff,texas,contemporary western,cold blooded murder,desert","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi145883417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"No Country for Old Men Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000849/","name":"Javier Bardem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000982/","name":"Josh Brolin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565092/","name":"Cormac McCarthy"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: No Country for Old Men: Directed by Ethan Coen, Joel Coen. With Tommy Lee Jones, Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson.

There is just something so effectual and uncompromising about it, that mere words will only begin to skim the surface of the cinematic excellence on display.\n\nAt its most simplistic, the film is a game of cat and mouse. The mouse here is Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon two million in cash after a drug deal gone wrong, and takes it thinking nothing of it. He tries to cover his tracks, but ends up letting the group looking for the money, figure out his identity. The cat is Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), a hit-man hired to find Moss and the money. But Chigurh is unconventional at best; he also happens to be bordering on mentally insane. And another man, a law man this time, Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), is on the trail of both men as they criss-cross around Texas.\n\nRight up until its dénouement, the film is simply brilliant. Taut and thrilling, it blows right through the majority of its two hour runtime with ease. Even during moments of slowing down, the film stays right on track and never feels like it has run its course. It engages even when it appears that nothing is happening. The Coen Brothers truly crafted what appears at first glance to be a masterpiece, even if it is their first real shot at something that is not indelibly and inarguably their own. Even without reading Cormac McCarthy's novel, I know that the Coens have done it justice, even with their bitterly twisted and dark sense of humour scattered throughout the film.\n\nBut all of that comes to a standstill as the film concludes. The last twenty or so minutes feel like hours as the film wraps itself up, and it almost feels like these scenes belong to another movie entirely (one that borders on being pretentious and monotonous). I realize now that McCarthy's novel probably ends the same way, but it does not help provide closure to the fact that the movie is so break-neck paced right up until this happens. Its brilliance is shattered by what looks to be a series of tattered events thrown together to provide closure for all of the characters, alive or dead, and for its audience. It speaks volumes to the film's title, but it just does not feel satisfying compared to the rest of what we saw. Even with its enigmatic devices at play, I still cannot come to terms with how the film closes. It does haunt, and in a way, it may prove to be a significantly stronger ending as time rolls on. But as it stands now, it just feels weak.\n\nWhat is also a bit of a surprise, and only seems to appear as the film concludes, is the music. It is not so obvious at first, but the majority of the film is audibly shown with just the sounds the characters make and no background music to speak of. This element is brilliantly used, as it helps intensify every situation and makes the film downright terrifying in some cases. It just helps truly make the film come together, and only helps establish the quick pacing even more so. It was definitely a surprise, and one that will probably help the lasting impact of the film become even stronger.\n\nThe lush and bloodsoaked visuals also help to define the film. Despite the film taking place mainly in deserted areas, or the desert itself, the camera manages to capture just the right essence of what the writing and acting is conveying. The isolation and the terror almost become characters themselves through these visuals, and are sure to be recognized as the award season rolls in.\n\nThe film's acting is also very well done. Brolin anchors the film and even when it is just the audience reacting to his attempts at saving his life, he manages to deliver the best performance of his career. He breathes life into Moss, and truly brings a sense of pathos to the character. We feel for him and his greedy mistake, and as he develops into a man unwilling to go down without a fight, he only manages to up the ante for himself countlessly. Jones, as the law man stuck on the fringe of every event, also does very well for himself. Most of his work is simply delivering dialogue, but it is delivered in such a fashionable sense that you feel like he is speaking to the bigger picture of things, and not just himself. I would have liked a bit more development in his character, but what little there is helps his performance greatly.\n\nSupporting turns from Woody Harrelson and Kelly Macdonald are also done well, but are overshadowed by the main cast by both Brolin and Jones.\n\nAnd even more of an overcast is Bardem as the ruthless Chigurh. He absolutely nails this character down to his very bones. If anyone is merely toying with the idea of seeing the film, it should be specifically for Bardem. His performance is calculating and plagued with petrifying silence. When he chooses to talk, his words sound like they are being given by the essence of evil. This is a man with a plan, but it is one that only belongs to him. His enigmatic presence is developed throughout the film, and never once does it feel particularly appropriate to understand where this menace comes from. Watching him on screen is a jolt to the heart, and will go down as one of the best performances of the decade. His terrible hair only helps to make his character that more scary and formidable.\n\nNo Country for Old Men is one of the best pictures of the year, even if it is flawed. Its brilliance and lasting impact with leave you haunted.\n\n8.5/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":909170,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-04-02","keywords":"sheriff,texas,contemporary western,cold blooded murder,desert","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi145883417","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"No Country for Old Men Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000849/","name":"Javier Bardem","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000982/","name":"Josh Brolin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565092/","name":"Cormac McCarthy"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Yet, by the end of the film you feel that you are looking right at the man. Why?

She acts as his conscience, his anchor, yet she actually wasn't there for a third of the film. Hoffmann retired before Jobs went back to Apple. As for Seth Rogan as Steve Wosniak, what can I say. He blew me away as he stood toe to toe with Fassbender in a show down that took my breath away with its intensity, and he stole the entire scene from Fassbender, proving he is much more than just the comic relief of Judd Apatow films.\n\nJeff Daniels as the conventional CEO John Sculley, recruited by Jobs to deal with a most unconventional visionary in a pioneering industry, absolutely nails the part. The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-23","keywords":"computer,father daughter relationship,apple computer,dialogue driven,1990s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424367385","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career -- beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 -- Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410596/","name":"Walter Isaacson"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The scene towards the middle of the film where Sculley and Jobs have it out is a work of art in itself of dialogue, editing, and acting, and the time shifting between the present and various pasts of their relationship is expertly done.\n\nAs for the plot? It takes place entirely at three product launches - the Mac in 1984, the NeXT computer in 1988, and the iMac in 1998, and the central theme is Jobs' relationship with his daughter Lisa, the paternity of whom he did not come to terms with for years. Of course, if Jobs had even one product launch like the ones in the film with everybody he's ever known approaching and reproaching him, Jobs would have had security like the secret service at every launch afterwards.\n\nSo don't approach this like a documentary, instead approach it like the art it was meant to be and I think you'll enjoy it greatly. And regardless of what others say, I think it gives the most humane portrayal of Jobs I've seen on film. Strongly recommended.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":163294,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2015-10-23","keywords":"computer,father daughter relationship,apple computer,dialogue driven,1990s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3424367385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjEyODU3MTA0NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDc4NjE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set backstage in the minutes before three iconic product launches spanning Jobs' career -- beginning with the Macintosh in 1984, and ending with the unveiling of the iMac in 1998 -- Steve Jobs takes us behind the scenes of the digital revolution to paint an intimate portrait of the brilliant man at its epicenter.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1055413/","name":"Michael Fassbender","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0736622/","name":"Seth Rogen"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000965/","name":"Danny Boyle"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159111/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0815070/","name":"Aaron Sorkin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410596/","name":"Walter Isaacson"],"duration":"PT2H2M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Mission accomplished!!!","reviewBody":"For the avid Harry Potter reader the whole suspense leading up to HP Order of the Phoenix can be summed up in the word "how". How are they going to translate a nearly 900 page book to the screen, how are they going to tie together a storyline that in the 5th book breaks into dozens of streams like a mighty river coming to its delta.\n\nThis seemingly impossible task is well accomplished by astute summation of plot and concentration of action. Also, the heart and soul of the book, i.e. the thematic spirit of the story and Rowling's shining gift for characterization are given the fullest support in this film more so than in any previous HP movie.\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix basically involves Harry being persecuted by the government for telling a truth they refuse to believe all while dealing with the same feelings of teen angst and emerging love that any ordinary teen finds stressful and consuming. Only through the love and dedication of family and especially friends does Harry come across the means to fight back against the government, elude his enemies and make some sense of his emotional turmoil.\n\nMost reader's will come out of the theater saying "I wish they had shown this or that." However, all will leave satisfied that they have been treated to a faithful rendering brilliantly acted and directed. All the HP movies are a "good watch" but in this one we get a great movie.\n\nWe have the advantage of going to our HP movies with a non-reader and she was, to say the least, blown away and pronounced it a near classic. My daughter and myself have read and reread the books many times over and came out limp from exhilaration, our keen anticipation very much fulfilled.\n\nA few highlights: The acting is best ever. The three principles push themselves to a new level. My favorite new characters were Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge, excellent (you'll love to hate her) and Natalia Tena as Tonks. Natalia is sheer delight. She is the penultimate punk rock witch girl(think Dead Milkmen here). And Helena Bonham Carter is in her medium (she played the witch Morganna in the movie Merlin) as the dangerous and demented Bellatrix LeStrange.\n\nBattle scenes: breathtaking. Commraderie: The only HP that actually caused me to get teary so heartfelt are the portrayals of friendship and family.\n\nSee the film knowing that unless you want a 10hour movie some things are going to have to go.

Mission accomplished!!!","reviewBody":"For the avid Harry Potter reader the whole suspense leading up to HP Order of the Phoenix can be summed up in the word "how". How are they going to translate a nearly 900 page book to the screen, how are they going to tie together a storyline that in the 5th book breaks into dozens of streams like a mighty river coming to its delta.\n\nThis seemingly impossible task is well accomplished by astute summation of plot and concentration of action. Also, the heart and soul of the book, i.e. the thematic spirit of the story and Rowling's shining gift for characterization are given the fullest support in this film more so than in any previous HP movie.\n\nHarry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix basically involves Harry being persecuted by the government for telling a truth they refuse to believe all while dealing with the same feelings of teen angst and emerging love that any ordinary teen finds stressful and consuming. Only through the love and dedication of family and especially friends does Harry come across the means to fight back against the government, elude his enemies and make some sense of his emotional turmoil.\n\nMost reader's will come out of the theater saying "I wish they had shown this or that." However, all will leave satisfied that they have been treated to a faithful rendering brilliantly acted and directed. All the HP movies are a "good watch" but in this one we get a great movie.\n\nWe have the advantage of going to our HP movies with a non-reader and she was, to say the least, blown away and pronounced it a near classic. My daughter and myself have read and reread the books many times over and came out limp from exhilaration, our keen anticipation very much fulfilled.\n\nA few highlights: The acting is best ever. The three principles push themselves to a new level. My favorite new characters were Imelda Staunton as Delores Umbridge, excellent (you'll love to hate her) and Natalia Tena as Tonks. Natalia is sheer delight. She is the penultimate punk rock witch girl(think Dead Milkmen here). And Helena Bonham Carter is in her medium (she played the witch Morganna in the movie Merlin) as the dangerous and demented Bellatrix LeStrange.\n\nBattle scenes: breathtaking. Commraderie: The only HP that actually caused me to get teary so heartfelt are the portrayals of friendship and family.\n\nSee the film knowing that unless you want a 10hour movie some things are going to have to go. Leave having enjoyed a film that takes the beans and water and instead of a nice large coffee treats one to a perfectly concentrated, most artfully brewed and extremely tasty espresso.

Seldom have I seen such a fun programme. Yes, fun. This was funny, sexy, violent, bonkers and emotionally truthful in a way that other series fail to achieve.\n\nTo think that this was aiming for any kind of historical accuracy is mad. It was made as an entertainment riffing on possible historical events. The use of modern language, initially jarring, ends up working to its advantage. There's no more reason to dislike modern usage than there is to dislike cod medieval or cod turn of the millennia language. Any language choice is going to be inauthentic so you might as well go for modern vernacular which has the side effect of milking the dialogue for humour. Using Donovan's Hurdy Gurdy Man for the theme tune is as inspired as using Nick Cave for the theme tune of Peaky Blinders. \n\nYou might also like to note the satirical reference to other well-known franchises and the use of Shakespearian minor characters. The two centurions sampling the "stash" of the witch doctor was comedy gold.\n\nYes, how we all hunger for the certainty of the old days when you knew where you were. When Loved It or Hated It reviews could be searched on and all TV programmes followed the same rules and were as bland as each other. Now all we have left is "helpful" so please regard this review as a provocative Loved It review.

I think that's the most accomplished thing Eastwood does here. Making sure that the war at home is just as intense as the war in Iraq. Another major plus is that, on a technical level, the film is flawless as it contains some of the year's best cinematography, a touching music score and some of the best sound effects out there.\n\nThe wartime scenes are all shot extremely well and I think the best thing about them is the feeling the director shows in the fact that these men are really in a trap not knowing where the next bullet is going to come from. The scenes of Kyle doing his job were full of tension as were the scenes where we get more gunfire.

I'm not sure how many people could have predicted that Cooper, who was mostly playing comedy roles, would turn into such a fine dramatic actor but he's turning into one of the most dependable actors out there. He's simply wonderful here and manages to really come across as a tortured person. The film shows Kyle from various points in his life. His wild younger days. His rise through the Seals. Of course, some of the most talked about scenes deal with the depression and anxiety that starts to set in. We've seen many actors deal with the "struggling vet returning home" and Cooper manages to bring a real depth to the character.\n\nAmerican SNIPER isn't going to end up being the best movie on 2014 but it's certainly a very impressive film.

The division's ability to stop murders before they happen is based on the psychic ability of three people who were mutant byproducts of a failed genetic program designed to help babies born from drug-dependent mothers. Cruise's character, John Anderton, is motivated by the loss of his own son, who was abducted and murdered six years earlier. Accordingly, he's a strong supporter of the controversial program, whose opponents feel it could potentially make an error and people might be wrongfully convicted, if not potentially rehabilitated. That action begins when Anderton is identified as a future killer, and he hits the road running. This may sound a little like The Fugitive, but in this case, you don't know if the man on the run is--or, rather, will be--guilty.\n\nBased on a short story by futurist Phillip K. Dick, author of Blade Runner, the atmosphere of a dark world with high technology having gotten out of hand, almost as though it snuck up on us without our knowing, remains the theme. To remind us that we aren't controlled by technology, but are nonetheless overrun by it, there are frequent references to current-day familiarities, such as department stores and restaurants, such as The Gap and McDonalds, where impressively entertaining high-tech mass marketing gadgets know what you've purchased before and offer new suggestions for consideration. (Sounds like a visit to amazon.com?) Spielberg lightens up the tone with his signature wit and humorous quips and visuals now and then, as opposed to Ridley Scott's more serious and consistently dark visualization portrayed in Blade Runner.\n\nAs a plotline, Minority Report is intelligent, has a good consistent flow, isn't always predictable (at least not that long before it happens), has many twists and turns with legitimate dead-ends, and above all, tells a plausible story (even if the basic premise itself requires considerable suspension of disbelief). As Anderton begins to unravel the true story about the corruption behind the pre-crime program, he is lead even further towards his destination as predicted by the `pre-cognitives' who predicted his crime. To tell any more of the story would disclose too much; besides, it isn't necessary. You know all you need to know here.\n\nThe best parts of the movie are so good  from the high-tech special effects to the light-hearted humorous moments to the good, steady flow of the action and plotline  that the problems with the film are easily forgiven. That said, my main gripe is the presumption that, in the future, anyone convicted of a crime before it happens is immediately sent to a state of suspended animation, an alternative form of the death penalty. This is obviously one of the main sources of controversy within the storyline, but anyone can see that, in almost all cases, the predicted murders were not premeditated, if not potentially accidental, in which case, psychological counseling and some form of probation would be enough. There's nothing to suggest in the film that the context is a police state, which would allow the premise to make sense. Yet, so much of the movie is based on this premise, that may be bothersome to the discerning viewer. There are many such similar oversimplifications, each of which could be quite easily solved with a minor change or a quick dialog line or two, hence a mild sense of sloppiness in direction.\n\nStill, in the end, these didn't bother me that much.

There are many such similar oversimplifications, each of which could be quite easily solved with a minor change or a quick dialog line or two, hence a mild sense of sloppiness in direction.\n\nStill, in the end, these didn't bother me that much. I still had a great time, and enjoyed it as the frivolous and wonderfully playful action/thriller it was intended to be.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":529331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2002-09-18","keywords":"year 2054,future noir,neo noir,washington d.c.,psychic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Minority Report","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3333161241","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhMjlhYTItMzViYi00ODFiLTlhNTAtYzQyYzM5ZmM4MDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhMjlhYTItMzViYi00ODFiLTlhNTAtYzQyYzM5ZmM4MDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0608090/","name":"Samantha Morton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012382/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001140/","name":"Philip K.

It also has some crazily quirky characters and they all play along in a bigger plot which isn't that easy to predict, or should I say, not your typical Disney princess story. The film in my opinion is just about a very good one and here below is why I felt that about it.\n\nThe story as said is kind of a big adventure, not to ruin the main storyline for those of you planning to watch it but it contains a lot of different people and places which just make it generally good fun. It contains humour that can be for some very funny, typical animation style humour but without it the film would seem stale and unloved. One major part of the story and a reason I think so many people love this movie is the songs, the score and the lyrics then sung over are fantastic and really make this a movie to remember but also brings it out in a warm glow as well.\n\nThe voice work for the movie is nice and I think they picked the right people for the job(and not only for the singing). Kristen Bell is just one of the voices you may recognise and her portrayal as Ana is fun and different yet not so different from other Disney princesses. Idina Menzel as Elsa has by far the most powerful voice in the movie and her singing is really brought out in possibly the most famous song from this movie "Let it Go". I liked Josh Gad as Olaf, his little voice matches Olaf perfectly and you will see why, and he also provides a lot of the humour.\n\nOf course adapting a Hans Christian Andersen story is going to be difficult, but I think Chris Buck and Jennifer Lee bring it well to the screen and there safe handed direction really works. The writers also do well, not sure how much of the original story is there but in any case the writers seem to do it some great justice. The look of this film is amazing, such slick animation with a beautiful flow of things, and when any things like ice is involved, the detail put into every little bit is immensely done well and just wonderful to look at among everything going on too.\n\nMain criticisms, well it has to be said the film probably isn't as good as certain people may have you believe, yes it's a fun Disney animation but that can also be the problem, over the top drama which can after a while annoy but it may not also. I said it has animation like humour before and that is also why I didn't think this was the perfect animation film, there aren't a lot of laughs to be had and even when characters such as Olaf try to provide that comic relief, the jokes aren't delivered that well, I will add though that kids will probably laugh a lot at this.\n\nOf course I will recommend this to any Disney fan, you can't get much more than this in there long line of films and is fast becoming one of the best known modern Disney films as well. I think this is definitely one for the children and don't tell boys they can't enjoy it, I think anyone of age or gender can have a great time with this film. If you dislike a good old sing song and a melodramatic kind of story then really, this isn't at all for you, some people will absolutely hate this but I think it depends on why you watch movies.\n\nOverall a Just About Very Good movie and one film that was hard to give a score. I think it may be so hard to rate because of the amount of people who say it is the best thing they have ever seen but then many also have heard people say that and feel it is overrated. Just go along with it, and even if you feel this isn't your type of movie then just try to enjoy it, don't hate it because of the characters or songs and you may just have found a gem of an animation movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":595388,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2013-11-27","keywords":"magic,snowman,sister sister relationship,ice,snow","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""First Time in Forever" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2482677785","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2Nzk4NTg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzMTc0MDE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE2Nzk4NTg4MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzIzMTc0MDE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Fearless optimist Anna teams up with Kristoff in an epic journey, encountering Everest-like conditions, and a hilarious snowman named Olaf in a race to find Anna's sister Elsa, whose icy powers have trapped the kingdom in eternal winter.

    <title lang="en">The Right One</title>
    <desc lang="pl">The Right One: Directed by Ken Mok. With Cleopatra Coleman, Iliza Shlesinger, Leanne Lapp, David Koechner.

Cashing in is okay, but I think his serious experiments say a lot about his intuitions and intents. They aren't the most intelligent experiments, but possibly the cream of the mainstream Hollywood director's establishment.\n\nHere we get both rolled into one. Its not as edgy or visually intelligent as 'Good Thief,' but it has some elements.\n\nFirst the bad: Soderbergh's notion of structure is the vignette. He'll shape a segment as if it were a skit with all else just backstory. For instance he has here a terrific piece where Pitt and Clooney as veterans and Damon as novice go to visit a Dutch heist coordinator. They converse in a highly abstract and idiosyncratic parablese which amuses us and flummoxes Damon. Damon inadvertently calls the boss's young niece a slut, and we are never sure who is putting on whom.\n\nIt is a wonderful orchestration of clever writing, spontaneous acting and intimate camera-work. These last two are a particular concern of Soderbergh's, but with a well-written shape it both confused and clarified in different directions. This one segment is the soul of the whole project: it amuses, it has a lot of collaborative, seemingly ad hoc acting, and it makes no sense.\n\nThis was never a heist film, instead it is in the con genre. That genre derives from the detective story where the writer is trying to fool the viewer (and some characters). In the con, some characters try to fool some other characters and the writer selectively covers and uncovers narrative so that the viewer is fooled as well.\n\nInteresting twists happen when the viewer is fooled differently than the sucker character, or when there are multiple and parallel cons. The narrative folding comes in the parallel, warring realities that the viewer must surf. But always there is a resolution of the 'real' narrative, just as in the detective story. You always find out who is the fooler and who the foolee (including ourselves).\n\nAnd as with the detective story, we are told just _how_ it is done. We expect this and have to be given some special reward if this doesn't happen.\n\nIt doesn't happen here. There is no way to go back and put together a story that makes any sense at all. Surely this could have been done, but the plain fact is that Soderbergh doesn't care and he wants us to know he doesn't.\n\nInstead, he wants us to focus on his folding. He folds all his 'serious' films: movies about movies (more than four levels deep in 'Full Frontal') or about imagined reality. 'Limey' overlaid scattered intent with parallel jumpcuts.\n\nIn this case, he has Julia acting a character who pretends to be Julia. In an homage to 'The Player' he has Bruce Willis as her companion when Julia com Julia. You can just imagine him cackling with his players over this bit.\n\nBut it is all clever bits like this in the small: nothing clever at the scale of a real movie. For that, we'll have to wait until he stumbles away from his enchantment with the miracle of acting and discovers the miracle of long form writing.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":374795,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2004-12-15","keywords":"heist,sequel,pretending to be pregnant,father daughter relationship,reference to spongebob squarepants","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Twelve","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1989804313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxNzQ0NjAtNmI0MS00NzQ5LTkxNzItMjExMWU0M2Q0MTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNmYxNzQ0NjAtNmI0MS00NzQ5LTkxNzItMjExMWU0M2Q0MTE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000093/","name":"Brad Pitt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000210/","name":"Julia Roberts"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001752/","name":"Steven Soderbergh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0108864/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024560/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1079776/","name":"George Nolfi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425138/","name":"George Clayton Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0751207/","name":"Jack Golden Russell"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But will mankind's new space defenses be enough?","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1628841/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"nalandy"},"dateCreated":"2016-06-23","inLanguage":"English","name":"Today I learned that a big action movie can be boring","reviewBody":"TL;DR: It was actually boring. There was a story here that had potential but it was let down by terrible acting, bad dialog, no story or character development at all and, ultimately, no soul to this one. \n\n3 points for above average special effects, -7 for just an awful movie. Netflix this one.\n\nEdition watched: 3D IMAX\n\nIn 1996's Independence Day, Bill Pullman's speech hit you emotionally somewhere. Even if that emotion was disgust, you had a reaction. All of Will Smith's one liners made you cringe or laugh. No matter how much you may deny it publicly, Randy Quaid's end put a lump in your throat the first time you saw it. There was soul to that movie, even though it was an ensemble cast, characters were developed, the story progressed and there were heroes you cheered for and aliens you despised.\n\nNone of that was present in 2016's Independence Day. All the new actors were either bad or terrible. I didn't care if the aliens won or lost. Not only were the new actors bad but some of the dialog they were forced to work with was just terrible. Jessie T. Usher's character has a few key lines that are supposed to hearken back to those emotional one liners from Will Smith in 1996, such as: "Welcome to Earth!". Yet Usher delivered those lines in such a deadpan, soulless way that made me wonder if he thought he was supposed to be playing an emotionless android. Then you have my favorite emotionless android actor Brent Spiner, who is someone I know to be a quality actor, yet the dialog and scenes with him were so bad I had to wonder for a second if all his previous work was done by a twin. \n\nI could go on, but the acting and dialog were just parts of the problem. There was no character development at all. They simply tried to cram too much into this movie. From the constant pandering to a Mainland Chinese audience (unnecessary scenes that should have been used for any kind of plot or character development) to Vivica A. Fox's minuscule screen time, there was too much shoved into this 120 min movie which ended up making it a big mess that went nowhere. In the end, I formed no attachment to any of the new characters and was detached from old characters that I once cheered for.\n\nThe most damning thing though is, despite all the explosions and this alien invasion, there was no excitement. I was bored. There was a girl in front of me texting and using FB messenger and I found myself involuntarily lifting my 3D glasses and reading her text chain and messenger thread till I caught myself and put my glasses back on. Her inane chatter about how boring this movie was, her cat, the guy she was sitting next to and so forth were more interesting to me than the movie on the huge IMAX screen was.\n\nAs a huge fan of alien invasion movies, I walked out feeling like this was such a huge opportunity wasted. If you told me the basic story of this move yesterday, I would've been ecstatic to see a trilogy. Now I hope the 3rd one dies in production and they put the money to a Battle Los Angeles 2."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":173615,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-07-19","keywords":"alien,alien invasion,mothership,independence day,human versus alien","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3946558489","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3ODE5MDM2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAyMDk5ODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3ODE5MDM2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAyMDk5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Using recovered alien technology, the nations of Earth have collaborated on an immense defense program to protect the planet.

But will mankind's new space defenses be enough?","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1628841/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"nalandy","dateCreated":"2016-06-23","inLanguage":"English","name":"Today I learned that a big action movie can be boring","reviewBody":"TL;DR: It was actually boring. There was a story here that had potential but it was let down by terrible acting, bad dialog, no story or character development at all and, ultimately, no soul to this one. \n\n3 points for above average special effects, -7 for just an awful movie. Netflix this one.\n\nEdition watched: 3D IMAX\n\nIn 1996's Independence Day, Bill Pullman's speech hit you emotionally somewhere. Even if that emotion was disgust, you had a reaction. All of Will Smith's one liners made you cringe or laugh. No matter how much you may deny it publicly, Randy Quaid's end put a lump in your throat the first time you saw it. There was soul to that movie, even though it was an ensemble cast, characters were developed, the story progressed and there were heroes you cheered for and aliens you despised.\n\nNone of that was present in 2016's Independence Day. All the new actors were either bad or terrible. I didn't care if the aliens won or lost. Not only were the new actors bad but some of the dialog they were forced to work with was just terrible. Jessie T. Usher's character has a few key lines that are supposed to hearken back to those emotional one liners from Will Smith in 1996, such as: "Welcome to Earth!". Yet Usher delivered those lines in such a deadpan, soulless way that made me wonder if he thought he was supposed to be playing an emotionless android. Then you have my favorite emotionless android actor Brent Spiner, who is someone I know to be a quality actor, yet the dialog and scenes with him were so bad I had to wonder for a second if all his previous work was done by a twin. \n\nI could go on, but the acting and dialog were just parts of the problem. There was no character development at all. They simply tried to cram too much into this movie. From the constant pandering to a Mainland Chinese audience (unnecessary scenes that should have been used for any kind of plot or character development) to Vivica A. Fox's minuscule screen time, there was too much shoved into this 120 min movie which ended up making it a big mess that went nowhere. In the end, I formed no attachment to any of the new characters and was detached from old characters that I once cheered for.\n\nThe most damning thing though is, despite all the explosions and this alien invasion, there was no excitement. I was bored. There was a girl in front of me texting and using FB messenger and I found myself involuntarily lifting my 3D glasses and reading her text chain and messenger thread till I caught myself and put my glasses back on. Her inane chatter about how boring this movie was, her cat, the guy she was sitting next to and so forth were more interesting to me than the movie on the huge IMAX screen was.\n\nAs a huge fan of alien invasion movies, I walked out feeling like this was such a huge opportunity wasted. If you told me the basic story of this move yesterday, I would've been ecstatic to see a trilogy. Now I hope the 3rd one dies in production and they put the money to a Battle Los Angeles 2.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":173615,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2016-07-19","keywords":"alien,alien invasion,mothership,independence day,human versus alien","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3946558489","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3ODE5MDM2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAyMDk5ODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ3ODE5MDM2OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAyMDk5ODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Using recovered alien technology, the nations of Earth have collaborated on an immense defense program to protect the planet.

Rosario Dawson plays the yardmaster that assists from headquarters while Jessy Schram plays the separated wife of the newbie conductor.\n\nThe movie's based on the real-life CSX 8888 Incident, otherwise known as the Crazy Eights Incident, which involved a runaway freight train in northwestern Ohio in 2001. Locomotive #8888 was pulling 47 cars, including some with hazardous chemicals, and ran unmanned for two hours and 66 miles at speeds of up to 51 mph. (***Don't read the rest of this paragraph if you don't want to know how the real-life incident ended before seeing the movie***). Attempts to derail the train using a portable derailer failed, as did an attempt by police to shoot at an emergency fuel cutoff switch, which didn't work because the button has to be pressed for several seconds before the engine shuts down due to lack of fuel. A northbound freight train took succor in a siding area where the crew released its locomotive and waited for the runaway to pass. Like in the movie, they had a crew of two: Jess Knowlton, an engineer with 31 years of service; and Terry L. Forson, a relative neophyte conductor. They proceeded to chase the runaway train and successfully locked on to the rear car of the runaway, then slowing it by applying the dynamic brakes or their locomotive. Once the runaway had slowed to 11 miles per hour, trainmaster Jon Hosfeld ran alongside the train, jumped on, and shut down the engine.\n\nWhile the movie starts somewhat bland it quickly picks up momentum for a realistic non-stop thrill ride. The realism is refreshing in this day and age of cartoony action blockbusters and their multiple "yeah, right" action scenes (not that there's anything wrong with those movies, as long as you're in the right mode). Washington and Pine make for good protagonists and you start to care about them as the story progresses. Moreover, the movie doesn't overstay its welcome at a mere 98 minutes.\n\nThe film was shot in numerous locations extending from central Pennsylvania to eastern Ohio, which serve up a nice rolling hills backdrop with the occasional river. Minor note: You'll observe a woodchuck scamper across the tracks in one scene where he/she thankfully DOESN'T become ground chuck.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: "Unstoppable" is worthwhile as a believable disaster thriller. While it lacks the potent subtext and overall greatness of 1985's "Runaway Train," it makes up for it with its realistic and kinetic tone, not to mention the fact that it's based on a true incident.\n\nGRADE: B","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":191909,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2010-11-10","keywords":"train,runaway train,train engineer,freight train,train movie","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unstoppable: Trailer #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3068790297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQzNDI1OTk1Nl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDg1NDYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A rail company frantically works to prevent an unmanned, half-mile-long freight train carrying combustible liquids and poisonous gas from wiping out a city."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000243/","name":"Denzel Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1517976/","name":"Chris Pine"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0276484/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0093560/","name":"Mark Bomback"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <desc lang="pl">The Lego Batman Movie: Directed by Chris McKay. With Will Arnett, Michael Cera, Rosario Dawson, Ralph Fiennes. A cooler-than-ever Bruce Wayne must deal with the usual suspects as they plan to rule Gotham City, while discovering that he has accidentally adopted a teenage orphan who wishes to become his sidekick." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt4116284/","name":"The Lego Batman Movie","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcyNTEyOTY0M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTAyNzU3MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A cooler-than-ever Bruce Wayne must deal with the usual suspects as they plan to rule Gotham City, while discovering that he has accidentally adopted a teenage orphan who wishes to become his sidekick.","review":{"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":{"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt4116284/"},"author":{"@type":"Person","name":"dave-mcclain"},"dateCreated":"2017-02-12","inLanguage":"English","name":"This Lego movie is even better than the original and leaves me anxious for what's next.","reviewBody":"In 2014, we became acquainted with an ignorant but arrogant billionaire with orange hair who wanted to rule the world. Call him President Business. Well, that's what they called him in "The Lego Movie". (What? Who did you think I was talking about?) The process of defeating that cartoonish villain involved joining together a vast array of different characters who had to learn to put aside their differences and work together to wrest power from that evil businessman-turned-politician. (Yes, of course I'm still talking about the first Lego movie.) All this may sound scary, but the animated feature film that I've been describing since the very beginning of this paragraph had some important lessons to teach about teamwork and the specialness of all people – whether they're made out of plastic or just look and act plastic on screen. Ignorant arrogance like this can also be very funny (as long as it's fictional) and "The Lego Movie" delivered on that promise. Doubling down on that kind of humor is that movie's 2017 spin-off "The Lego Batman Movie" (PG, 1:44), an inspired mashup of Danish toys and American comic books.\n\nTo simply say that Lego Batman is a loner is like referring to the Unabomber as anti-social. Batman / Bruce Wayne (voiced by Will Arnett) lives in Wayne Manor with his devoted butler and father figure Alfred (Ralph Fiennes), but still chooses to spend all his time alone, watching movies or staring wistfully at a photo of him with his long-dead parents. Even when he's in public (whether as Batman or as Bruce Wayne), he treats the citizens of Gotham as his subjects and only wants their adulation. Batman gives himself full credit for keeping Gotham crime-free and is convinced that he's the only one who can do it – and that he doesn't need help or advice from anyone. This Batman probably thinks that the first film's Oscar-nominated original song "Everything is Awesome" was written for and about him and his life. (The character could have also written the film's tagline: "Always be yourself. Unless you can be Batman.") A high-class gala thrown to honor the retiring Commissioner Gordon turns out to be an extremely consequential gathering. As Bruce Wayne struts through the crowd, the original Commissioner Gordon's daughter, Barbara (Rosario Dawson), who is taking over for her father, begins making a speech in which she calls for the police to work more closely with Batman – as a team (an idea which makes him spit out his drink) – and to limit Batman's autonomy (think, the setup for "Captain America: Civil War"). Just then, the Joker (Zach Galifianakis) shows up. The day before, as Batman was foiling the Joker's latest plan to take over the city, the two argued about how important they are in each other's lives. When Batman refused to admit that the Joker is his main nemesis (saying, "I fight with a lot of people. I like to fight around."), the Joker's feelings were hurt. Now, at the gala, Joker suddenly switches tactics. He surrenders to the new Commissioner Gordon, confesses to his crimes and asks to be sent to prison. Oh, and earlier at this same gala, Wayne accidentally adopts young orphan Dick Grayson (Michael Cera).\n\nBatman decides that the Joker is up to something, but he's not sure what it is, so he comes up with a plan to get rid of him for good. Batman includes his new ward Dick Grayson (now called Robin) because he considers Dick expendable. The two of them go to Superman's Fortress of Solitude where they see Superman throwing a party for the rest of the Justice League's super angular superheroes. Nevertheless, Batman takes advantage of his fellow heroes being distracted by the party to steal Superman's Phantom Zone projector so he can send the Joker into the Phantom Zone. The problem with that plan is that it would put the Joker in the company of some of the world's greatest villains, a situation which could end up unleashing untold evil on the world, and forcing Batman to enlist the help of his fellow members of the Justice League (and others) as he confronts his biggest challenge ever. Just don't expect Batman's ego to go quietly into the sunset (or the Bat Signal) – or for the Joker to be so easily defeated.\n\n"The Lego Batman" movie is an inspired and extremely enjoyable crossover between Lego's growing animation efforts and established DC Comics characters  plus a long and diverse list of others. The plot makes full use of the potential inherent in combining such diverse and storied properties – and effectively builds upon what made the first Lego movie so popular. The script (which combines the efforts of five different writers), along with Chris McKay's direction is both funny and just plain fun, a lot of that due to the juxtaposition of Batman's self-centered intensity with Robin's innocent earnestness. All of the voice work is top-notch, but Will Arnett's ignorant arrogance as Batman is really what makes the movie. He's as humorous as any of Will Farrell's similarly pompous live action characters (e.g., as Ron Burgundy in the "Anchorman" movies or as race car driver Ricky Bobby in "Talladega Nights") and –whether intentionally or not – reminds us of the attitudes, words and conduct of some American politicians. This Lego movie is even better than the original and leaves me anxious for what's next.

This story follows how Charlie had been hexxed by one of his acquaintances in Junior high, the hexx was that Charlie will never be happy and that if he has sex with somebody, that person will find their one and only right after that. Charlie finds his one and only but he is afraid of losing her because of his hexx. this story was very explicit but it had a happy ending, and it did what a comedy should do, make you laugh. if you turn of your mind and sit and enjoy, you will enjoy this movie.i rate this a 7 out of 10 because even know it wasn't meant to be this big landmark in cinematic achievement, it made me do what i like to do, sit down and ENJOY a movie.\n\n7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":88543,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-09-21","keywords":"sex,breasts,true love,leg spreading,sex on stairs","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Good Luck Chuck Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2981167385","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyMzY2OTU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDkzNjUy._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIyMzY2OTU4NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDkzNjUy._V1_.jpg","description":"In order to keep the woman of his dreams from falling for another guy, Charlie Logan has to break the curse that has made him wildly popular with single women: Sleep with Charlie once, and the next man you meet will be your true love.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0176981/","name":"Dane Cook","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004695/","name":"Jessica Alba","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283945/","name":"Dan Fogler"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0375068/","name":"Mark Helfrich"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026937/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0831457/","name":"Josh Stolberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2521593/","name":"Steve Glenn"],"duration":"PT1H41M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A wonderful actor.\n\nWhat struck me right away was the extremely good, scored intro, the music throughout Dystopia is of I am a genuine fan of classic horror, so I was a bit suspicious when I heard VIAPLAY was doing Dystopia but boy was I surprised for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that it truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is. The Director of Dystopia is Richard Jarnhed and I need to keep an eye out for his future endeavors as he is madly talented.\n\nAnd secondly this was directed by just one director. Richard directed all 8 episodes and that's not normal in Scandinavia.\n\nAnd lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.\n\nThe acting is wonderful and directing is amazing.

All of Matthew Vaughn's movies have been good, and he was able to push it further with this one. I would call it an action comedy, but there is more of an emphasis on the action than the genre usually has. \n\nThere are cool POV shots, and it gets you right into the thick of it. It mixes it up with some short moments where it doesn't cut so quickly, as well as a few long takes that are particular nice. The violence and comedy has a guttural component, which a person like me really enjoys, but it will throw some off. \n\nThe film is a throwback to old spy flicks, while at the same time being a sort of parody. It is humorous throughout. Samuel L. Jackson plays an odd megalomaniac who makes you laugh more than shiver, which goes with the tone of the movie. It is nice to see Samuel L. in the role of a bad guy. I have no doubt that many will enjoy the henchwoman, who has a different element to her. Colin Firth fits in with the particularly suave spying; and, the newcomer playing the protagonist, Taron Egerton, handles both the action and comedy well. Mark Strong is always a good actor for movies with dark humor. It is fun, however those who are sensitive may have trouble enjoying it. It is not a film for everyone, but that makes it better for others. I personally think it is Vaughn's best work.\n\n8.75","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":621422,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-29","keywords":"spy,female rear nudity,training,class differences,secret organization","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1901244185","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A super-secret spy organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5473782/","name":"Taron Egerton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

All of Matthew Vaughn's movies have been good, and he was able to push it further with this one. I would call it an action comedy, but there is more of an emphasis on the action than the genre usually has. \n\nThere are cool POV shots, and it gets you right into the thick of it. It mixes it up with some short moments where it doesn't cut so quickly, as well as a few long takes that are particular nice. The violence and comedy has a guttural component, which a person like me really enjoys, but it will throw some off. \n\nThe film is a throwback to old spy flicks, while at the same time being a sort of parody. It is humorous throughout. Samuel L. Jackson plays an odd megalomaniac who makes you laugh more than shiver, which goes with the tone of the movie. It is nice to see Samuel L. in the role of a bad guy. I have no doubt that many will enjoy the henchwoman, who has a different element to her. Colin Firth fits in with the particularly suave spying; and, the newcomer playing the protagonist, Taron Egerton, handles both the action and comedy well. Mark Strong is always a good actor for movies with dark humor. It is fun, however those who are sensitive may have trouble enjoying it. It is not a film for everyone, but that makes it better for others. I personally think it is Vaughn's best work.\n\n8.75","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":621422,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-01-29","keywords":"spy,female rear nudity,training,class differences,secret organization","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1901244185","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzk1MTc4NDE2NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzQxMjY1MzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A super-secret spy organization recruits an unrefined but promising street kid into the agency's ultra-competitive training program just as a global threat emerges from a twisted tech genius.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000147/","name":"Colin Firth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5473782/","name":"Taron Egerton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

The story, acting, pacing, editing, etc. was just fantastic. Affleck's directing was solid, and the suspense will keep you entertained right through to the last seconds. I loved it. \n\nIt did have one irritating thing, though, kind of a big one. It pointed most of the accolades to Affleck's character and the CIA. This really was not true. It was Ken Taylor and the Canadians who really pulled 'the Canadian Caper' off so successfully.\n\n"When Taylor heard a few years ago that Mendez had sold movie rights to his book (which, to be fair, is much more generous than the movie about Canada's role), "I said, 'Well, that's going to be interesting.'...."The movie's fun, it's thrilling, it's pertinent, it's timely," he said. "But look, Canada was not merely standing around watching events take place. The CIA was a junior partner."\n\n"The old postscript sent the message that, for political reasons, Canada took the credit. A sarcastic kicker noted that Taylor received 112 citations. The clear implication was that he did not deserve them."(Sept/Oct., 2012, thestar.com)".\n\nSo the USA does another revision on history here. I believe 'Argo' goes this far. Yes, it's based on a true story - the movie does it's best to allude that it sticks to technical accuracy. And it really does, in some ways. Historical pictures of flag burners, rioters, gate climbers, etc.. up against Argo film stills run by during the credits make it seem that the facts were adhered to down to the tiniest detail. In reality, it wasn't Tony Mendez or the CIA who were responsible for the success of this operation; actually they were barely there. \n\nSince the movie premiered, Ben Affleck has added emphasis on the movie postscripts since then that gives kudos to the Canadians' role. This was after Ken Taylor politely complained, as a Canadian would tactfully do. But Affleck did this only after pressure from Taylor himself.\n\nI can understand the need to spice up events to make them as exciting and entertaining as possible, don't get me wrong. But this film needs to let the audience know that more explicitly than it does, even after the changed postscripts.\n\nStill, a really entertaining and riveting film, very well done, and easily worth seeing. As a matter of fact, don't miss it."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":593452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-11-21","keywords":"iran,hostage,u.s. embassy,escape,american embassy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winner: Best Picture","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1537319449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As the Iranian revolution reaches a boiling point, a CIA 'exfiltration' specialist concocts a risky plan to free six Americans who have found shelter at the home of the Canadian ambassador.

The story, acting, pacing, editing, etc. was just fantastic. Affleck's directing was solid, and the suspense will keep you entertained right through to the last seconds. I loved it. \n\nIt did have one irritating thing, though, kind of a big one. It pointed most of the accolades to Affleck's character and the CIA. This really was not true. It was Ken Taylor and the Canadians who really pulled 'the Canadian Caper' off so successfully.\n\n"When Taylor heard a few years ago that Mendez had sold movie rights to his book (which, to be fair, is much more generous than the movie about Canada's role), "I said, 'Well, that's going to be interesting.'...."The movie's fun, it's thrilling, it's pertinent, it's timely," he said. "But look, Canada was not merely standing around watching events take place. The CIA was a junior partner."\n\n"The old postscript sent the message that, for political reasons, Canada took the credit. A sarcastic kicker noted that Taylor received 112 citations. The clear implication was that he did not deserve them."(Sept/Oct., 2012, thestar.com)".\n\nSo the USA does another revision on history here. I believe 'Argo' goes this far. Yes, it's based on a true story - the movie does it's best to allude that it sticks to technical accuracy. And it really does, in some ways. Historical pictures of flag burners, rioters, gate climbers, etc.. up against Argo film stills run by during the credits make it seem that the facts were adhered to down to the tiniest detail. In reality, it wasn't Tony Mendez or the CIA who were responsible for the success of this operation; actually they were barely there. \n\nSince the movie premiered, Ben Affleck has added emphasis on the movie postscripts since then that gives kudos to the Canadians' role. This was after Ken Taylor politely complained, as a Canadian would tactfully do. But Affleck did this only after pressure from Taylor himself.\n\nI can understand the need to spice up events to make them as exciting and entertaining as possible, don't get me wrong. But this film needs to let the audience know that more explicitly than it does, even after the changed postscripts.\n\nStill, a really entertaining and riveting film, very well done, and easily worth seeing. As a matter of fact, don't miss it.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":593452,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2012-11-21","keywords":"iran,hostage,u.s. embassy,escape,american embassy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Winner: Best Picture","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1537319449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxODY4NDUyM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMDk1Nzg3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As the Iranian revolution reaches a boiling point, a CIA 'exfiltration' specialist concocts a risky plan to free six Americans who have found shelter at the home of the Canadian ambassador.

I know everyone is going to hate this review to pieces, so many "Jacksoners" are following every bit of film he creates trampling in their wake over all those who dare oppose him. But I personally think that had he kept himself closer to the original, he would've ended with a better movie.

In fall of 1991 Thurgood Marshall retired from SCOTUS, and, feeling the pressure to nominate a black man to the court, Bush picked Clarence Thomas, a man who many felt wasn't qualified for the court (as Jeffrey Wright's character says at one point, "I have students who are better qualified than Clarence Thomas"). But when asked by someone from Senator Biden's office about whether or not he should be confirmed, Anita Hill couldn't hold back and be silent and told the truth: she was sexually harassed, as far as having to hear vulgar talk about sex (i.e. "Long Dong Silver" is a thing in a court of public record, I mean Jesus), and asked out on multiple occasions. It got out to the press, she had to go testify, as did Thomas, and all this before a seemingly immovable date for the man's confirmation.\n\nThis all could have made for a compelling mini-series, or an even longer movie. What is a little disappointing about is that this is probably the best this kind of movie could be, but it's still not quite good enough, or I should say that the detail isn't exactly strong enough. Mostly I found that the depiction of Clarence Thomas not exactly weak but basic: for such a man who I may find reprehensible (from before and during his 25 past years on the court), Wendell Pierce gives Thomas as a person, and character in this story, some dignity, and Anita Wright as Clarence Thomas' wife as well. But what about anything else aside from his indignation and sad faces? What else was/is there to Thomas? \n\nMaybe that just wasn't the focus, and director Fumiyama (of last year's surprise critical hit Dope), wanted to keep it on the politics and especially the media - many figures who you might recognize from CNN and elsewhere in cable news pop up as younger selves - certainly keeps a good eye on that. But what does make an impact and what is certainly good to look past the flaws here, are a) Kerry Washington's performance, which is so unwavering in making Anita Hill a figure of sympathy but also aching empathy, completely stripping anything else except this woman and having to put up being solid in front of the committee. And b) how the story and movie treats the whole aspect of how equal rights were not there in 1991, and may still not be (or, to put it another way, despite the changes the struggle is ongoing), for women in this country.\n\nLike the recent People vs OJ series, we get a story that seems to deal a lot in race - Thomas' "High tech lynching" comment that struck an emotional chord for some but was seen as being disingenuous by others - and yet it's really about how women fit it, or certainly do not, in a world full of men. Images of women and how they talk and react, every little thing that they say, is under the kind of scrutiny here that men just don't have to face, at least not to this level. Confirmation is about the representation of a woman's image in politics, in the media, in the public at large, and what that does when up against a "street fight" as one of the raging white male Republican senators says. You can read a lot into what the hearings, as seen in this story, say about the national public character, and yet it's displayed for us to see in those hearings, and the behind-the-scenes fights and digging for dirt via the Republican senators, as opposed to spelled out all the time.\n\nConfirmation doesn't stretch entirely too far for it to be great, or quite on the level of Recount or Game Change as far as HBO original movies about hot-button/controversial political stories in this country from the modern age, but within what it tries to do, and from the acting from all the players that is never less than convincing (Kinnear, who plays a rather unsympathetic Senator Biden, who screwed up things in the hearing just as far as scheduling people to testify, is one of those), it works. I'd even watch it again if just to see how Washington pulls off the majority of her scenes.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5141,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2016-04-16","keywords":"supreme court,1990s,reference to anita hill,african american judge,black male judge","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3610293529","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDk5NzY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwODAxODE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDk5NzY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwODAxODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the United States' Supreme Court is called into question when former colleague, Anita Hill, testifies that he had sexually harassed her."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913488/","name":"Kerry Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0682495/","name":"Wendell Pierce"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266622/","name":"Rick Famuyiwa"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173527/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005861/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0335666/","name":"Susannah Grant"}],"duration":"PT1H50M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In fall of 1991 Thurgood Marshall retired from SCOTUS, and, feeling the pressure to nominate a black man to the court, Bush picked Clarence Thomas, a man who many felt wasn't qualified for the court (as Jeffrey Wright's character says at one point, "I have students who are better qualified than Clarence Thomas"). But when asked by someone from Senator Biden's office about whether or not he should be confirmed, Anita Hill couldn't hold back and be silent and told the truth: she was sexually harassed, as far as having to hear vulgar talk about sex (i.e. "Long Dong Silver" is a thing in a court of public record, I mean Jesus), and asked out on multiple occasions. It got out to the press, she had to go testify, as did Thomas, and all this before a seemingly immovable date for the man's confirmation.\n\nThis all could have made for a compelling mini-series, or an even longer movie. What is a little disappointing about is that this is probably the best this kind of movie could be, but it's still not quite good enough, or I should say that the detail isn't exactly strong enough. Mostly I found that the depiction of Clarence Thomas not exactly weak but basic: for such a man who I may find reprehensible (from before and during his 25 past years on the court), Wendell Pierce gives Thomas as a person, and character in this story, some dignity, and Anita Wright as Clarence Thomas' wife as well. But what about anything else aside from his indignation and sad faces? What else was/is there to Thomas? \n\nMaybe that just wasn't the focus, and director Fumiyama (of last year's surprise critical hit Dope), wanted to keep it on the politics and especially the media - many figures who you might recognize from CNN and elsewhere in cable news pop up as younger selves - certainly keeps a good eye on that. But what does make an impact and what is certainly good to look past the flaws here, are a) Kerry Washington's performance, which is so unwavering in making Anita Hill a figure of sympathy but also aching empathy, completely stripping anything else except this woman and having to put up being solid in front of the committee. And b) how the story and movie treats the whole aspect of how equal rights were not there in 1991, and may still not be (or, to put it another way, despite the changes the struggle is ongoing), for women in this country.\n\nLike the recent People vs OJ series, we get a story that seems to deal a lot in race - Thomas' "High tech lynching" comment that struck an emotional chord for some but was seen as being disingenuous by others - and yet it's really about how women fit it, or certainly do not, in a world full of men. Images of women and how they talk and react, every little thing that they say, is under the kind of scrutiny here that men just don't have to face, at least not to this level. Confirmation is about the representation of a woman's image in politics, in the media, in the public at large, and what that does when up against a "street fight" as one of the raging white male Republican senators says. You can read a lot into what the hearings, as seen in this story, say about the national public character, and yet it's displayed for us to see in those hearings, and the behind-the-scenes fights and digging for dirt via the Republican senators, as opposed to spelled out all the time.\n\nConfirmation doesn't stretch entirely too far for it to be great, or quite on the level of Recount or Game Change as far as HBO original movies about hot-button/controversial political stories in this country from the modern age, but within what it tries to do, and from the acting from all the players that is never less than convincing (Kinnear, who plays a rather unsympathetic Senator Biden, who screwed up things in the hearing just as far as scheduling people to testify, is one of those), it works. I'd even watch it again if just to see how Washington pulls off the majority of her scenes.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5141,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"2016-04-16","keywords":"supreme court,1990s,reference to anita hill,african american judge,black male judge","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Teaser #1","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3610293529","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDk5NzY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwODAxODE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc2MDk5NzY3OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMzQwODAxODE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Judge Clarence Thomas' nomination to the United States' Supreme Court is called into question when former colleague, Anita Hill, testifies that he had sexually harassed her.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913488/","name":"Kerry Washington","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0682495/","name":"Wendell Pierce","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001427/","name":"Greg Kinnear"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266622/","name":"Rick Famuyiwa"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0209226/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173527/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005861/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0335666/","name":"Susannah Grant"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The L Word is back and it's not bad at all!","reviewBody":"The L Word changed my life. I was a very confused 14 year Colombian girl living in a very small city with my very Catholic family. I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show. Just don't watch it if you don't like it but you can't say it's not a great deal for our community and for us, lesbians.\n\nLesbian, from Lesbos. The origin of the L word is beautiful. Read about Sappho, read her poems. We should be proud of it and we should celebrate it.\n\nWe need more shows like this. Visibility is our best allied, don't forget that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5372,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-08","keywords":"lesbian","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000884/","name":"Jennifer Beals"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0595485/","name":"Katherine Moennig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0354157/","name":"Leisha Hailey"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0886561/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052980/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271093/","name":"Michele Abbott"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149669/","name":"Ilene Chaiken"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271884/","name":"Kathy Greenberg"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3625959449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmYzNGQzZjQtZGYxOS00OTRiLTg2ZDEtYzhhMmQzYzU5NjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmYzNGQzZjQtZGYxOS00OTRiLTg2ZDEtYzhhMmQzYzU5NjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Season 2 is available to stream August 6, 2021 on SHOWTIME."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show. Just don't watch it if you don't like it but you can't say it's not a great deal for our community and for us, lesbians.\n\nLesbian, from Lesbos. The origin of the L word is beautiful.

Two talented lead actors completely wasted and the casting of Sam Claffin was so bad on many levels. It starts like your usual revenge story but the "twist" in the end which is theoretically good falls so flat because of the pace of the film. The film felt 3 hours long for its 105 minute runtime. This is a story that deserves to be a gripping thriller but it was shot like some tragedy. Sam Claffin's performance as the antagonist is one of the worst you will ever see this year.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3767,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2021-10-07","keywords":"brother,cheating wife,adulterous wife,car accident,hockey rink","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3584868377","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDBmNjhmM2ItYWU5YS00NTUxLWEyMDYtOTQ2N2I2Nzk4MTQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDBmNjhmM2ItYWU5YS00NTUxLWEyMDYtOTQ2N2I2Nzk4MTQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQWpnYW1i._V1_.jpg","description":"Every Breath You Take is a searing psychological thriller about a psychiatrist (Casey Affleck), whose career is thrown into jeopardy when his patient takes her own life.

Unfortunately, it's lost in a sea of expositional arguing (don't tell, show) and agenda (political, real, or pretend)-driven drama. Waited 20 minutes to start feeling something but I couldn't. Too bad, because without the forced statements and with another pass at the script, it might have had something.

Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that.

Quick disaster with a mystery to it, jarring deaths, naked Milla, all in the first few minutes. It keeps up the pace throughout. In terms of critical comments, yes, you don't really care about the characters, but so what? How often do you really care about the monster fodder in horror films? And true, it wasn't a literal working of the movie, it didn't take place in a mansion and it didn't involve exploring lots of rooms and solving puzzles. That's because it's a movie. A literal translation of Resident Evil would probably be really dull. Games and movies are very different mediums. I don't think some people here understand that. One guy said he thought the movie rocked but after repeated viewings he thought it sucked, and that's a video game player attitude - movies don't have to have good replay value, it's okay to enjoy them once.

That is probably true but I am convinced that there are some actors who can make comedy look easy. At his best, Steve Carrell does just that. In 'Dinner for Schmucks' he occupies the role of Barry Speck, a blithering idiot for whom life is a jolly holiday and cynicism is a notion that seems to have passed him over. Barry's view of the world is devoid of irony or whimsy, he stares blankly with wide eyes and a stupid grin and never seems to understand what is happening right in front of him.\n\nLet me give you an example. Near the beginning of the movie, Barry is being seduced by a blond bimbo who tells him that she thinks she needs a spanking. We get this exchange: \n\nThe Blond: "I'm a naughty school girl. I've been bad." Barry: "You look a little old to be a school girl" The Blond: "You're my schoolmaster. I need to be punished." Barry: "I'm not really qualified for that. I work for the IRS."\n\nThat kind of idiocy makes Barry the perfect tool for Tim Conrad (Paul Rudd), a mid-level financial executive who curries favor with his implacable boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) when he manages to sell a Swiss billionaire on the idea of turning defective bombs into effective, yet unattractive, lamps. Fender is impressed and invites Tim to an annual dinner party at his mansion, a "Dinner for Winners" in which the purpose is for each guest to bring the biggest idiot they can find. The guest with the most entertaining idiot wins a trophy.\n\nThe journey getting to that dinner party mostly involves Tim trying to survive Barry's idiocy. He has a way of saying and doing the most outrageous things while maintaining a demeanor that lets us believe that he hasn't the slightest clue that his behavior is the least bit odd, even his hobby of making cute dioramas with dead mice.\n\nThe first half of the film is genuinely funny, as it observes Barry and his world as he looks out with wide eyes, a goofy smile. Yet, the rest of the movie is spotty. Once we get to know Barry, the movie tries to mix a riot of slapstick comedy with moments of sentimentality that are mostly made up of half-baked speeches about the value of friendship.\n\nThe third act gets the film back on track somewhat as we finally arrive at that dinner party. What works are the simple observations about Barry and the other morons in attendance (one of whom is Jeff Dunham who is in a marital spat with one of his dummies). Those characters are funny but the scene goes overboard with a very long battle involving Barry and a nitwit mind-reader named Thurman Munch (Zach Galifianakis) who wears Dickies over his shirts and has a self-satisfied autobiography called "Your Mind Is My Puppet". The scene quickly spirals into a very bizarre area reminiscent of some of Monty Python's lesser sketches.\n\nSteve Carrell is the the entire reason for seeing 'Dinner for Schmucks'. His wonderful performance is pitch perfect, playing a lovable dolt who genuinely believes what he says, even when he confesses to Tim that the reason his wife left his that "I lost her clitoris". To see the deadpan look in his eyes is to understand that Barry believes this statement completely. It is also possibly to understand why his wife really left him.\n\n*** (of four)"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104328,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-13","keywords":"smashing a bottle against a wall,wine,hairy chested male,man wears eyeglasses,remake","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dinner for Schmucks: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3797747481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who "succeeds" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called "dinner for idiots," which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210895/","name":"Stephanie Szostak"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 0427152, Title: Dinner for Schmucks, 
 --- Description: Dinner for Schmucks: Directed by Jay Roach. With Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, Zach Galifianakis, Jemaine Clement. When he finds out that his work superiors host a dinner celebrating the idiocy of their guests, a rising executive questions it when he's invited, just as he befriends a man who would be the perfect guest." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0427152/","name":"Dinner for Schmucks","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTk5MTYzNTIyMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM3MTQ2Mw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"When he finds out that his work superiors host a dinner celebrating the idiocy of their guests, a rising executive questions it when he's invited, just as he befriends a man who would be the perfect guest.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0427152/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"The_Film_Cricket","dateCreated":"2011-03-24","inLanguage":"English","name":"Spotty comedy, saved by Carrell's brilliant performance","reviewBody":"I think it was the great comedian Edmund Gwenn who made the statement that "Dying is easy, comedy is hard." That is probably true but I am convinced that there are some actors who can make comedy look easy. At his best, Steve Carrell does just that. In 'Dinner for Schmucks' he occupies the role of Barry Speck, a blithering idiot for whom life is a jolly holiday and cynicism is a notion that seems to have passed him over. Barry's view of the world is devoid of irony or whimsy, he stares blankly with wide eyes and a stupid grin and never seems to understand what is happening right in front of him.\n\nLet me give you an example. Near the beginning of the movie, Barry is being seduced by a blond bimbo who tells him that she thinks she needs a spanking. We get this exchange: \n\nThe Blond: "I'm a naughty school girl. I've been bad." Barry: "You look a little old to be a school girl" The Blond: "You're my schoolmaster. I need to be punished." Barry: "I'm not really qualified for that. I work for the IRS."\n\nThat kind of idiocy makes Barry the perfect tool for Tim Conrad (Paul Rudd), a mid-level financial executive who curries favor with his implacable boss Lance Fender (Bruce Greenwood) when he manages to sell a Swiss billionaire on the idea of turning defective bombs into effective, yet unattractive, lamps. Fender is impressed and invites Tim to an annual dinner party at his mansion, a "Dinner for Winners" in which the purpose is for each guest to bring the biggest idiot they can find. The guest with the most entertaining idiot wins a trophy.\n\nThe journey getting to that dinner party mostly involves Tim trying to survive Barry's idiocy. He has a way of saying and doing the most outrageous things while maintaining a demeanor that lets us believe that he hasn't the slightest clue that his behavior is the least bit odd, even his hobby of making cute dioramas with dead mice.\n\nThe first half of the film is genuinely funny, as it observes Barry and his world as he looks out with wide eyes, a goofy smile. Yet, the rest of the movie is spotty. Once we get to know Barry, the movie tries to mix a riot of slapstick comedy with moments of sentimentality that are mostly made up of half-baked speeches about the value of friendship.\n\nThe third act gets the film back on track somewhat as we finally arrive at that dinner party. What works are the simple observations about Barry and the other morons in attendance (one of whom is Jeff Dunham who is in a marital spat with one of his dummies). Those characters are funny but the scene goes overboard with a very long battle involving Barry and a nitwit mind-reader named Thurman Munch (Zach Galifianakis) who wears Dickies over his shirts and has a self-satisfied autobiography called "Your Mind Is My Puppet". The scene quickly spirals into a very bizarre area reminiscent of some of Monty Python's lesser sketches.\n\nSteve Carrell is the the entire reason for seeing 'Dinner for Schmucks'. His wonderful performance is pitch perfect, playing a lovable dolt who genuinely believes what he says, even when he confesses to Tim that the reason his wife left his that "I lost her clitoris". To see the deadpan look in his eyes is to understand that Barry believes this statement completely. It is also possibly to understand why his wife really left him.\n\n*** (of four)","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104328,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-13","keywords":"smashing a bottle against a wall,wine,hairy chested male,man wears eyeglasses,remake","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dinner for Schmucks: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3797747481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who "succeeds" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called "dinner for idiots," which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210895/","name":"Stephanie Szostak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Lane's ability to predict the outcome of games quickly turns him into a golden boy, but it soon becomes apparent that he's bitten off more than he can chew when his abilities start to falter.\n\nTwo for the Money is a forgettable, generic thriller that doesn't really offer anything new. The film does have some entertaining moments and the first half of the movie is actually pretty exciting to watch. But, the second half is really slow and very tedious. It just drags on and on and for no reason either. It could have been a nice 90 minute movie but the story is stretched out into a two hour film. Luckily, Al Pacino is in the movie and he keeps the film exciting. He gives a good, over the top performance and he pretty much raises the film up to mediocrity. Personally, sports betting isn't that interesting to me but Al Pacino makes it interesting. He can turn a bad script into an okay movie which is what he does with the film. Let's be honest, the script is not very good and the direction is weak. It's so obvious where things are going which is not surprising because this is the same guy that made Taking Lives.\n\nAl Pacino is playing mentor to Matthew McConaughey and their chemistry together isn't very strong. McConaughey is a pretty weak actor and he can't keep up with Pacino. The lead role should have gone to someone else. Rene Russo is okay as Pacino's wife. She gives a decent performance but she was a little too bland to truly stand out. Another thing about the film that people may not like is that every character is unlikable. It's hard to care for these characters because they are either pretty mean or bland. It didn't really bother me because I watched the film to be entertained and I did get some entertainment value from the movie. In the end, if you like Al Pacino then you should give the film a shot, if you don't then just skip it.

But if you see past that you'll appreciate the immense atmosphere and mood that Ridley Scott piles on.

Not the least of which is Japan's alienating culture (from an NYPD point of view) and rigid rules. Nonetheless, Nick is determined to catch Sato and restore his honor.\n\nLike I said, the atmosphere of the film is overwhelming, which is really all the film needs. The clichés and stereotypes don't matter so much when you are involved this much. Hans Zimmer (his first film with Ridley Scott) provides a deeply emotional and very melodic score that'll be rattling around in your head for days. It's a shame it's never had a comprehensive CD release, as it's one of Zimmer's most impressive efforts.\n\nYou could call it a pretty 80s movies, but I still do feel that it holds up pretty well today.

Luther sees a Caribbean cruise poster in a Chicago travel agency window, and he begins to plan the trip.

He will save money by not buying a tree, having a party, or putting up decorations. The neighbors think he is crazy and want him to at least put Frosty the Snowman on his roof for the local decoration contest. The battle begins between the Kranks and their neighbors. Then Blair calls and tells her parents that she is flying home for Christmas with her fiancée. They have twenty-four hours to put up all the decorations and prepare for the Christmas party. The movie was based on a John Grisham book, 'Skipping Christmas'. It is a cute Christmas story with a lot of funny slapstick sketches.

I've seen it many times throughout the years and have noticed most people either don't know or don't care for this film. After rewatching it yesterday, I just had to write about it.\n\nThe casting was incredible in my opinion. People think of Ocean's Eleven or The Departed as movies with dream casts. I think Tropic Thunder holds its own. Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey are solid minor/supporting characters. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, but I find myself quoting all of his Les Grossman lines consistently. Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan, Bill Hader and Danny McBride are great additions. Jay Baruchel is his usual self, Brandon T Jackson was a solid part of the mix and the three main leads really deliver. Special mention to RDJ, by far my favorite performance.

I've seen it many times throughout the years and have noticed most people either don't know or don't care for this film. After rewatching it yesterday, I just had to write about it.\n\nThe casting was incredible in my opinion. People think of Ocean's Eleven or The Departed as movies with dream casts. I think Tropic Thunder holds its own. Tom Cruise and Matthew McConaughey are solid minor/supporting characters. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruise, but I find myself quoting all of his Les Grossman lines consistently. Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan, Bill Hader and Danny McBride are great additions. Jay Baruchel is his usual self, Brandon T Jackson was a solid part of the mix and the three main leads really deliver. Special mention to RDJ, by far my favorite performance. It's ridiculous how many layers there are to his character. At some point he's an Australian actor playing a Black guy playing an Asian farmer.\n\nAlmost every single scene has a quotable line.

I have. It was one of those movies that you watch once and don't really ever think about again. However, I liked the idea behind it and I'm a big fan of supernatural horror movies so, when I heard there was a "Boogeyman 2" I thought I'd check it out.\n\nThis is not the movie I expected. In fact, I feel quite deceived. More on that later.\n\nAfter a quite tense opening sequence where Laura (Renee O'Connor) first encounters the Boogeyman as a child, the movie moves onto the main storyline. Whereas the first movie was a man confronting his childhood demons in his family home, this movie is set in hospital where the main character also attempts to overcome her childhood fears. As well as finding herself in the worst staffed hospital of all time, one of Laura's doctors is none other than Jigsaw himself (the wonderful Tobin Bell, who is as creepy here as in the "Saw" movies). Things aren't looking good for her.\n\nOnce each of her fellow patients has revealed their fears in various non-too-subtle ways ("I'm not changing the light in your closet because I'M SCARED OF THE DARK!" "I'm not shaking your hand because I'M SCARED OF GERMS!" etc), they all begin to be killed by the evil Boogeyman who (surprise...surprise) uses their fears against them. I actually quite liked some of the deaths here which were suitably graphic and disturbing - I'm sure a lot of ketchup must have been used in the making of this movie.\n\nHowever, I ultimately felt deceived by "Boogeyman 2". \n\nThe makers actually trick you in a very naughty way - kinda like going to watch a "Nightmare On Elm Street" sequel only to discover that Freddie is no longer the evil spirit of a child murderer but is now an evil robot from the future. You'd say "Huh? This isn't anything like the first movie. I wanted to see a supernatural horror movie, not another Terminator clone!". You'll see exactly what I mean if you've seen "Boogeyman" and then watch "Boogeyman 2" (unfortunately, I can't be any more specific as it would be a spoiler). In fact, "Boogeyman 2" has so little to do with the first "Boogeyman" that I'm surprised they even share the same name. It also features one completely unnecessary scene of graphic nudity - whether this is a good thing or not depends upon whether you're still in high school. I left high school a while ago and found myself wondering why the scene needed to exist at all. Oh well.\n\nIn summary then, this is a very average little horror movie. I can't say I was particularly scared by any of it but it was nicely acted and had some cool death scenes (some of which reminded me a little bit of "Saw" if truth be told - no wonder Tobin Bell turned up!). \n\nIf you like watching teens running around dark corridors before losing their vital organs (and your DVD collection consists of movies such as "Halloween: Resurrection" and "Jason X"), then it's probably worth a rental. However, if you really enjoyed the first movie and want more of the same (or, like me, you're just looking for a good supernatural horror movie), I'm willing to bet that you'll be disappointed with "Boogeyman 2".","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1},"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-03-11","keywords":"second part,freaking out,mental health facility,tape over mouth,teen slasher","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Boogeyman 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2545615129","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJkMTVmZjQtNWU2MC00YjJjLTlkZTItZjNkMjc1NjhiZmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJkMTVmZjQtNWU2MC00YjJjLTlkZTItZjNkMjc1NjhiZmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1642290/","name":"Danielle Savre"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1959563/","name":"Matt Cohen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2306284/","name":"Chrissy Calhoun"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0079111/","name":"Jeff Betancourt"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017834/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0116611/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0797321/","name":"Brian Sieve"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0471392/","name":"Eric Kripke"}],"duration":"PT1H33M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I have. It was one of those movies that you watch once and don't really ever think about again. However, I liked the idea behind it and I'm a big fan of supernatural horror movies so, when I heard there was a "Boogeyman 2" I thought I'd check it out.\n\nThis is not the movie I expected. In fact, I feel quite deceived. More on that later.\n\nAfter a quite tense opening sequence where Laura (Renee O'Connor) first encounters the Boogeyman as a child, the movie moves onto the main storyline. Whereas the first movie was a man confronting his childhood demons in his family home, this movie is set in hospital where the main character also attempts to overcome her childhood fears. As well as finding herself in the worst staffed hospital of all time, one of Laura's doctors is none other than Jigsaw himself (the wonderful Tobin Bell, who is as creepy here as in the "Saw" movies). Things aren't looking good for her.\n\nOnce each of her fellow patients has revealed their fears in various non-too-subtle ways ("I'm not changing the light in your closet because I'M SCARED OF THE DARK!" "I'm not shaking your hand because I'M SCARED OF GERMS!" etc), they all begin to be killed by the evil Boogeyman who (surprise...surprise) uses their fears against them. I actually quite liked some of the deaths here which were suitably graphic and disturbing - I'm sure a lot of ketchup must have been used in the making of this movie.\n\nHowever, I ultimately felt deceived by "Boogeyman 2". \n\nThe makers actually trick you in a very naughty way - kinda like going to watch a "Nightmare On Elm Street" sequel only to discover that Freddie is no longer the evil spirit of a child murderer but is now an evil robot from the future. You'd say "Huh? This isn't anything like the first movie. I wanted to see a supernatural horror movie, not another Terminator clone!". You'll see exactly what I mean if you've seen "Boogeyman" and then watch "Boogeyman 2" (unfortunately, I can't be any more specific as it would be a spoiler). In fact, "Boogeyman 2" has so little to do with the first "Boogeyman" that I'm surprised they even share the same name. It also features one completely unnecessary scene of graphic nudity - whether this is a good thing or not depends upon whether you're still in high school. I left high school a while ago and found myself wondering why the scene needed to exist at all. Oh well.\n\nIn summary then, this is a very average little horror movie. I can't say I was particularly scared by any of it but it was nicely acted and had some cool death scenes (some of which reminded me a little bit of "Saw" if truth be told - no wonder Tobin Bell turned up!). \n\nIf you like watching teens running around dark corridors before losing their vital organs (and your DVD collection consists of movies such as "Halloween: Resurrection" and "Jason X"), then it's probably worth a rental. However, if you really enjoyed the first movie and want more of the same (or, like me, you're just looking for a good supernatural horror movie), I'm willing to bet that you'll be disappointed with "Boogeyman 2".","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2009-03-11","keywords":"second part,freaking out,mental health facility,tape over mouth,teen slasher","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Boogeyman 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2545615129","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJkMTVmZjQtNWU2MC00YjJjLTlkZTItZjNkMjc1NjhiZmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGJkMTVmZjQtNWU2MC00YjJjLTlkZTItZjNkMjc1NjhiZmRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1642290/","name":"Danielle Savre","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1959563/","name":"Matt Cohen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2306284/","name":"Chrissy Calhoun"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0079111/","name":"Jeff Betancourt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017834/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0116611/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0797321/","name":"Brian Sieve","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0471392/","name":"Eric Kripke"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>
