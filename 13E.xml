However, rather than a 1:1 adaptation, the film is built upon a fascinating structural conceit - although it tells the same story as Segher's novel, it is set in the here and now. At least, some elements are set in the here and now. In fact, only part of the film's milieu is modern. So, although such things as cars, ships, weaponry, and police uniforms are all contemporary, there are no mobile phones, no computers, people still use typewriters and send letters, and the clothes worn by the characters are the same as would have been worn at the time. In essence, this means that the film is set neither entirely in 1942 nor entirely in 2019, but in a strange kind of temporal halfway-house, borrowing elements from each. There's a fairly obvious reason that writer/director Christian Petzold employs this strategy, and it has to be said, it works exceptionally well, with the film's thematic focus symbiotically intertwined with its aesthetic to a highly unusual degree. Petzold doesn't so much suggest that history is repeating itself, as postulate that there's no difference between then and now. Unfortunately, aside from this daring aesthetic gambit, not much else worked for me, with the plot somnolent and the characters void of any relatable emotion.\n\nThe film tells the story of Georg (Franz Rogowski) a young man on the run from the "fascists". In Paris, he's entrusted with delivering some papers to George Weidel, a communist author currently in the city. However, when Georg goes to Weidel's hotel room, he finds the writer has committed suicide. Taking an unpublished manuscript, two letters from Weidel to his wife Marie, and Weidel's transit visa for passage to Mexico, Georg stows away on a train heading for Marseilles, one of the few European ports not yet under fascist control. Upon arriving, Georg visits the wife of a friend who died, Melissa (Maryam Zaree), to give her the bad news. However, she's deaf, and he has to explain the death through her young son, Driss (Lilien Batman), with whom he quickly forms a bond. Meanwhile, when he goes to the Mexican consulate to return Weidel's belongings, he is mistaken for Weidel himself, and he realises he has a chance to escape Europe, with Weidel booked on a ship sailing in a few days. As Georg awaits passage, he has several encounters with a mysterious woman, who, it is soon revealed is none other than Marie Weidel (Paula Beer), who is waiting for word from her husband. Not telling her that Weidel is dead, Georg finds himself falling for her.\n\nShot on location in Paris and Marseilles, everything from street signs to cars (including a few electric ones) to the front of buildings is modern, whilst Hans Fromm's crisp digital photography hasn't been aged in any way whatsoever. In terms of cultural signifiers, Petzold keeps it vague, although there is a reference to Dawn of the Dead (1978), with the closing credits featuring "Road to Nowhere" (1982). However, for everything that seems to locate the film in the 21st century, there's something to locate it in the 1940s, whether it be the absence of mobile phones, computers, and the internet, or the ubiquity of typewriters and letters. Along the same lines, Petzold keeps the politics generalised, with no mention of Nazis, concentration camps, or the Holocaust. Instead, the film makes reference to archetypal "fascists", never-defined "camps", and systemic "cleansing".\n\nThe combination of liminal elements of modernity and period-specific history sets up a temporal/cognitive dissonance which forces the audience to move beyond the abstract notion that what once happened could happen again. Instead, we are made to recognise that the difference between past and present is a semantic distinction only, and that that which once happened never really stopped happening. Indeed, given the resurgence of Neo-Fascism across Europe, built primarily on irrational xenophobic fears of the Other in the form of immigration, the refugee crisis is as bad today as it ever was in the 40s. The temporal dislocation also suggests both the specificity and the universality of the refugee experience - every refugee is fundamentally unique, but so too is the experience the same.\n\nThe other important aesthetic choice is the use of a very unusual voiceover narration. Introduced out of the blue as Georg begins reading Weidel's manuscript at around the 20-minute mark, there's no initial indication as to the narrator's identity or when the narration is taking place. Additionally, the narrator is unreliable, as on occasion he describes something differently to how we see it. The narration also "interacts" with the dialogue at one point - in a scene between Georg and Marie, their dialogue alternates with the VO; they get one part of a sentence and the VO completes it, or vice versa.\n\nHowever, although I really liked the temporal dissonance, the experimental VO didn't work nearly as well, serving primarily to pull you out of the film as you try to answer a myriad of questions - where and when is the voice is coming from; what is its relationship to the narrative; are we hearing a character speak or someone outside the fabula; how can the narrator have access to Georg's innermost thoughts at some points but not at others; why is the voice able to accurately describe things not seen by Georg, but often inaccurately describe things which are; why does the narration seem to be ahead of the narrative at some points, and behind it at others; what is the purpose of the pseudo-break of the fourth wall by having the VO alternate with dialogue? I don't have answers to all of these questions, but I think the point of the destabilising/defamiliarising narration is to reinforce the experience of being a refugee, which is a mass of stories within stories and fragments that often contradict one another.\n\nThe film has more problems than just the VO, however. To suggest the disenfranchised nature of what it is to be a refugee, Petzold depicts Georg as a non-person; he has very little agency and is instead someone to whom things happen. In short, he's passive, less a protagonist than a witness. Passive characters can work extremely well in the right circumstances (think of Chance Gardner (Peter Sellers) in Being There (1979), or the most famous example, Hamlet), but here, passivity combines with a dearth of backstory and character development, whilst Rogowski plays the part without a hint of interiority. Easily the most successful scenes in the film are those showing his friendship with Driss because they're the only moments where he seems like a person rather than a narrative construct, they're the only parts of the film that ring emotionally true.\n\nThis friendship, however, is secondary to the love story between Georg and Marie. Except that it isn't a love story; there's no emotional realism to it whatsoever. I understand what Petzold is going for here. He doesn't want a Hollywood love story of fireworks and poetic monologues, he wants to show that the war and their status as refugees has stripped them of their identities, and they are now effectively shells. However, this in no way necessitates such a badly written relationship void of emotional truth.\n\nWhat Petzold is trying to do in his characterisation of Georg is clear enough; as an archetypal refugee, Georg can't be seen to have much control over his affairs, and his time in Marseille must be static, an existence in-between more fully realised states. Petzold uses this to try to imply that to be divested of one's country is to be divested of one's identity. However, the extent of his passivity renders him completely unrealistic - he's not a person, he's a robot.\n\nTied to this is a lack of forward narrative momentum. Again, I understand that Petzold is trying to stay true to the experience, that the life of a refugee must necessarily involve a lot of waiting, repetition, and frustration. But again, it's the extent to which the film goes to suggest this. Yes, inertia is part of the theme insofar as the film depicts people suffering from crippling inertia, but it doesn't necessarily follow that the film needs to be so unrelentingly dull.\n\nEasily the most egregious problem is one that arises from a combination of these issues - it's impossible to care about any of the characters. Think of films as varied as Das Boot ist voll (1981), Le Havre (2011), or Toivon tuolla puolen (2017). All depict refugees, and all ring true emotionally, because they're populated by characters about whom we come to care. This is precisely what Transit is lacking. There is no pathos, with none of the characters coming across as anything but a cipher, a representative archetype onto which Petzold can project his thematic concerns. With little in the way of psychological verisimilitude or interiority, they simply never come alive as real people.\n\nAn intellectual film rather than an emotional one, Transit is cold and distant. And this coldness and distance has a cumulative effect, with the film eventually outlasting my patience. The temporal dissonance works extremely well, but it's really all the film has going for it. Petzold says some interesting things regarding the experience of refugees in the 21st century vis-à-vis refugees of World War II, and the mirror he holds up to our society isn't especially flattering. If only we could care about someone on screen. Anyone.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9643,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-04-05","keywords":"refugee,marseille france,voice over narration,assumed identity,assuming identity of a dead person","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Transit - Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi209500697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwY2E2ZTAtNzgzNS00NmY1LWI0Y2UtMDUyMWNjOWQ3NTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwY2E2ZTAtNzgzNS00NmY1LWI0Y2UtMDUyMWNjOWQ3NTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As fascism spreads, German refugee Georg (Franz Rogowski) flees to Marseille and assumes the identity of the dead writer whose transit papers he is carrying.

All depict refugees, and all ring true emotionally, because they're populated by characters about whom we come to care. This is precisely what Transit is lacking. There is no pathos, with none of the characters coming across as anything but a cipher, a representative archetype onto which Petzold can project his thematic concerns. With little in the way of psychological verisimilitude or interiority, they simply never come alive as real people.\n\nAn intellectual film rather than an emotional one, Transit is cold and distant. And this coldness and distance has a cumulative effect, with the film eventually outlasting my patience. The temporal dissonance works extremely well, but it's really all the film has going for it. Petzold says some interesting things regarding the experience of refugees in the 21st century vis-à-vis refugees of World War II, and the mirror he holds up to our society isn't especially flattering. If only we could care about someone on screen. Anyone.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9643,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2018-04-05","keywords":"refugee,marseille france,voice over narration,assumed identity,assuming identity of a dead person","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Transit - Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi209500697","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwY2E2ZTAtNzgzNS00NmY1LWI0Y2UtMDUyMWNjOWQ3NTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWUwY2E2ZTAtNzgzNS00NmY1LWI0Y2UtMDUyMWNjOWQ3NTQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"As fascism spreads, German refugee Georg (Franz Rogowski) flees to Marseille and assumes the identity of the dead writer whose transit papers he is carrying.

Director Derek Cianfrance's third feature is the follow-up to 2010's widely praised Blue Valentine, a movie whose supposed magnificence was lost on me. Cianfrance reteams with one of that film's stars, Ryan Gosling, for one of The Place Beyond The Pines' three segments that unfolds over a 15 year period with interconnected story lines that mixes elements of crime drama, teenage angst, questions about fate, and the complexities of father-son relationships.\n\nThe first segment is unquestionably the film's strongest, with Gosling further refining the brooding anti-hero character that seems to have become his stock-in- trade. His Luke character is introduced in the film's great opening scene that employs an extensive single tracking shot, as the audience views his heavily tattooed body and carnival motorcycle stunt rider profession, which convey Luke's societal fringe elements without saying a word. Luke's white trash status is also reinforced by the repeated wearing of a Metallica Ride The Lightning muscle tee and a ratty white t-shirt worn inside out in public, tag and all (I love that the latter is never addressed by any characters Luke meets). A reconnection with a woman (Romina, played by a solid Eva Mendes) he had a quickie fling with the last time his job brought him to town reveals that he's the father of her two-year old son. The news awakens Luke's paternal instincts and he attempts to insert himself back into the pair's lives, despite the complication of another man in Romina's life. Desperate to prove he can provide for Romina and his son, Luke ends up robbing banks, with the assistance of a scruffy auto mechanic he's met (an excellent Ben Mendelsohn providing some understated comic relief). Aspects of Luke and his deeds immediately bring to mind Gosling's role from last year's Drive. Despite the similarities in roles surprisingly played so close to each other, Gosling's unpredictable, violence-prone character commands the screen for the approximately hour long length of his segment. His storyline does admittedly benefit from the best writing of the three segments, courtesy of screenwriters Cianfrance, Ben Coccio, and Darius Marder.\n\nGosling's dynamism and that first segment's brilliance are only highlighted by the significantly diminishing returns that follow it. Segment two stars Bradley Cooper as a rookie cop who found himself involved in Luke's story, with other subplots involving police corruption, morality, and an unhappy marriage also playing out. I've always found Cooper to be a rather dull actor and his performance here hasn't changed my opinion; that, combined with the segment's derivative story, managed to effectively kill my segment one buzz. The writing is also too uneven - Cooper's character is set up as a smart, moral person, yet those qualities are a little too conveniently discarded when he's presented with a career-altering decision. Bruce Greenwood is memorable in a small role as a high-ranking cop, while Ray Liotta's minor role as an intimidating, crooked cop feels like the kind of role we've seen from him dozens of times already.\n\nSegment three completes The Place Beyond The Pines' downhill slide, focussing on the teenage sons (played by Dane DeHaan and Emory Cohen) of Gosling's and Cooper's characters. As the snoozy storyline featuring bratty behaviour from the screwed up high school students developed, I could never get past the fact the segment hinged on their chance meeting and eventual friendship. That meeting, considering the inextricably linked history they share via their fathers, was simply far too coincidental for me to suspend disbelief. Also distracting: a time jump of 15 years reveals Cooper's character and that of his wife (played by Rose Byrne) to have seemingly not aged at all, while Mendes' Romina looks to have aged about 25 years.\n\nI respect the fact that Cianfrance took some risks with The Place Beyond The Pines, which had its world premiere at TIFF - he throws in a major plot twist relatively early on and the movie's segmented structure is definitely a gamble and somewhat unconventional, but unfortunately, the loosely connected narrative and performances don't hold together over the course of the film's too-long 140 minute running time. The disappointing ending shouldn't come as much of a shock to anyone who has just witnessed the decline from the first-rate quality of the riveting opening segment to the progressively inferior chapters that follow. As the last third of it plays out, that swing has been so dramatic that it almost feels like we're watching an altogether different movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258851,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"bank robbery,neo noir,original story,bank,high school student","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi267494937","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzkwNzU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODczNzAzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzkwNzU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODczNzAzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A motorcycle stunt rider turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for his lover and their newborn child, a decision that puts him on a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop navigating a department ruled by a corrupt detective.

As the last third of it plays out, that swing has been so dramatic that it almost feels like we're watching an altogether different movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":258851,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-04-19","keywords":"bank robbery,neo noir,original story,bank,high school student","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi267494937","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzkwNzU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODczNzAzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjIyMzkwNzU0N15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwODczNzAzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A motorcycle stunt rider turns to robbing banks as a way to provide for his lover and their newborn child, a decision that puts him on a collision course with an ambitious rookie cop navigating a department ruled by a corrupt detective.

Good movies. The family that is at the center of the Danish film 'Dronningen' or 'Queen of Hearts' is in many ways similar to one of the two families in the Korean film 'Parasite'. It's a wealthy family that lives in a luxurious villa, surrounded by rich vegetation that will play a role in the story and atmosphere of the film. In the two floors villa, designed and furnished according to all the rules of the Scandinavian design, the family of the family of doctor Peter and his wife Anne, a lawyer specializing in crime and teenage abuse cases, lives an apparently happy and quiet life together with their twin girls who have a childhood sprinkled with riding lessons and readings from Lewis Carroll. The balance of the quiet happy family life will be broken by the appearance of the disturbing element represented in this film by Gustav, Peter's son from a previous marriage, a young man just out of adolescence, with some problems and resentments for the early exit of the father from his early life.\n\nI will refrain from telling more of the story of the film, as the action evolves gradually, with many surprising turns both in what happens on screen but especially in the psychology of the characters. As with 'Parasite', we will have trouble trying to fit this film into a cinematic genre. It is a family drama combined with a story about coming of age, an intrigue of love and passion with extreme eroticism, a strong social commentary on the appearances of bourgeois life in the age of political correctness and the apparent protection of troubled youth, and a psychological thriller. Everything is filmed flawlessly, in an elegant and aseptic setting surrounded by an eternally picturesque nature. The film aesthetics makes the brutality of some of the relationships and the action of the characters that we are witnessing appear even more shocking. The film seems to continue in the 21st century the themes of some of Ingmar Bergman's films, with a frankness and brutality that reminded me of Michael Haneke.\n\nIt's almost unbelievable that this is only the second film of director May el-Toukhy. 'Queen of Hearts' (for which she is also a screenwriter) is a well-written, smartly constructed, beautifully filmed and impeccably played movie. A film that adds to my recommendations in a cinematic season blessed with many interesting films that challenge the minds and hearts of quality movies fans.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10126,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"NC-17","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-03-28","keywords":"stepmother stepson relationship,stepmother stepson sex,unfaithful wife,infidelity,sex with stepmother","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Festival Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3607214617","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmVlNDRlMTQtMTQwOC00M2Y5LTgzM2ItYzZmZGRmNWYzZjk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmVlNDRlMTQtMTQwOC00M2Y5LTgzM2ItYzZmZGRmNWYzZjk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A successful lawyer jeopardizes her family and career when she seduces her teenage stepson."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0245988/","name":"Trine Dyrholm"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6625833/","name":"Gustav Lindh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470886/","name":"Magnus Krepper"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1392439/","name":"May el-Toukhy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0095264/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048411/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048118/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0477622/","name":"Maren Louise Käehne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1392439/","name":"May el-Toukhy"}],"duration":"PT2H7M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

That and that it was another film seen as part of my quest to see as many 2018 films as possible were my main reasons in seeing 'Under the Tree' from Icelandic director Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurdsson. \n\n'Under the Tree' is a truly fine film and manages to take a relevant subject (feuding neighbours) and explore it in a way that was hilarious, shocking and moving. It won't be one of my favourite films any time soon, but in no way should it be overlooked and should be seen as an example of how to execute a film with a subject like this well. Sadly, 'Under the Tree' has been released here alongside more expensive in budget films that have been quite big box office successes and films that people are more likely to go and see. While having enjoyed many of the films in question (in no way is it intended to be knock), 'Under the Tree' is better than most of them and deserves better.\n\nSure 'Under the Tree' is occasionally a touch overcooked and some may find some of the behaviours extreme. \n\nHowever, Sigurdsson directs with a perfect balance of hilarious mayhem and melancholic pathos. This is also reflected in the thought-provoking script he scripted with Huldar Breidfjord. Many parts are hilarious in a dark way, others genuinely shock and there are emotional parts too, all in a way that is kept plausible throughout. Neighbour feuding sounds insignificant on paper to some, but 'Under the Tree' makes it darkly funny, disturbing and melancholic, a not easy feat but beautifully done here.\n\nThe storytelling is always compelling, with the tensions having a bleakness and ferocity while still entertaining and emotionally resonating. There is a good deal happening, but not in a way that it feels cluttered with too many characters and subplots, instead there is enough breathing space and depth while having an alertness to the drama. \n\nA good cast would be needed to bring all this life. Luckily, 'Under the Tree's' cast is excellent. Particularly note-worthy of a cast where everybody is good and nobody bad is Edda Bjorgvinsdottir on fiercely intense form, her character near-unhinged. \n\nIt is a very well made film visually, beautifully shot in particular. The music is inspired, appropriate and cleverly used.\n\nOverall, great and shouldn't be forgotten. 9/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4499,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-09-06","keywords":"tree,revenge,sex scene,husband wife relationship,next door neighbor","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1409204505","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwODVjOWYtZjcyNi00MzkzLWI5MjYtNTVmMjlmYzMxMzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwODVjOWYtZjcyNi00MzkzLWI5MjYtNTVmMjlmYzMxMzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2621096/","name":"Steinþór Hróar Steinþórsson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084908/","name":"Edda Björgvinsdóttir"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0797610/","name":"Sigurður Sigurjónsson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2619779/","name":"Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurðsson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0453485/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0464992/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048411/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1458057/","name":"Huldar Breiðfjörð"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2619779/","name":"Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurðsson"}],"duration":"PT1H29M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While having enjoyed many of the films in question (in no way is it intended to be knock), 'Under the Tree' is better than most of them and deserves better.\n\nSure 'Under the Tree' is occasionally a touch overcooked and some may find some of the behaviours extreme. \n\nHowever, Sigurdsson directs with a perfect balance of hilarious mayhem and melancholic pathos. This is also reflected in the thought-provoking script he scripted with Huldar Breidfjord. Many parts are hilarious in a dark way, others genuinely shock and there are emotional parts too, all in a way that is kept plausible throughout. Neighbour feuding sounds insignificant on paper to some, but 'Under the Tree' makes it darkly funny, disturbing and melancholic, a not easy feat but beautifully done here.\n\nThe storytelling is always compelling, with the tensions having a bleakness and ferocity while still entertaining and emotionally resonating. There is a good deal happening, but not in a way that it feels cluttered with too many characters and subplots, instead there is enough breathing space and depth while having an alertness to the drama. \n\nA good cast would be needed to bring all this life. Luckily, 'Under the Tree's' cast is excellent. Particularly note-worthy of a cast where everybody is good and nobody bad is Edda Bjorgvinsdottir on fiercely intense form, her character near-unhinged. \n\nIt is a very well made film visually, beautifully shot in particular. The music is inspired, appropriate and cleverly used.\n\nOverall, great and shouldn't be forgotten. 9/10 Bethany Cox","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4499,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2017-09-06","keywords":"tree,revenge,sex scene,husband wife relationship,next door neighbor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1409204505","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwODVjOWYtZjcyNi00MzkzLWI5MjYtNTVmMjlmYzMxMzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTcwODVjOWYtZjcyNi00MzkzLWI5MjYtNTVmMjlmYzMxMzY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2621096/","name":"Steinþór Hróar Steinþórsson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0084908/","name":"Edda Björgvinsdóttir","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0797610/","name":"Sigurður Sigurjónsson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2619779/","name":"Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurðsson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0453485/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0464992/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048411/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1458057/","name":"Huldar Breiðfjörð","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2619779/","name":"Hafsteinn Gunnar Sigurðsson"],"duration":"PT1H29M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It's Gil who takes matters into his own hands when his hero the just traded to the San Francisco Giants, from the Atlanta Braves, Bobby Rayburn, Wesley Snipes, gets the short end of the stick by the teams management. That's by Bobby not being able to retain his number #11 on his Giants jersey that he feels made him a,.314 lifetime hitter, his supernatural powers in both hitting and catching a baseball.\n\nGil has his own problems at work and at home with his job as a sport supply executive specializing in hunting knives on the line and his old lady Ellen, Patti D'Arbanville, about to get complete custody of their seven year old son Richie,Andrew J. Ferchlad. But it's baseball,not job or family, that's Gil's true love. And it's in Bobby Rayburn that Gil a former little league baseball pitcher lives out his fantasy life as a major league baseball player. That's in Gil doing in Juan Primo, Beniclo De Toro, with a hunting knife in a hotel bath-house to get Bobby's number #11 back on his Giants jersey. Bobby the 40 million dollar man, that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him, who was in a king size slump all season now, with Primo gone and his famed #11 back, started hitting up to expectations.\n\nIt's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean, Brandon Hammond, from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool, which is the least he could do for him, Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball! Which Bobby treats as a game and way to make big bucks, 40 million of them, not the religion that Gil feel that it is! With everything that he did to get Bobby back in the grove in both hitting and fielding, by murdering his top rival on the team Juan Primo, Gil feels that he's not being given him the credit by Bobby, who has no idea what Gil did for him, that he so rightfully deserves. And with that and outraged and dejected Gil plans to make Bobby's life both personal and professional into a living hell on earth!\n\n***SPOILERS*** The movie "The Fan" is really a one man show with Robert De Niro at center stage doing his thing, being off the wall crazy, that he and only he can do best. Not only is De Niro or Gil Renard completely out of his mind but also omnipresent, like some kind of Deity, in seeming to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time. Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero, his battery mate, Coop, Charles Hallahan, when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was.\n\nThe ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on.

It's Gil who takes matters into his own hands when his hero the just traded to the San Francisco Giants, from the Atlanta Braves, Bobby Rayburn, Wesley Snipes, gets the short end of the stick by the teams management. That's by Bobby not being able to retain his number #11 on his Giants jersey that he feels made him a,.314 lifetime hitter, his supernatural powers in both hitting and catching a baseball.\n\nGil has his own problems at work and at home with his job as a sport supply executive specializing in hunting knives on the line and his old lady Ellen, Patti D'Arbanville, about to get complete custody of their seven year old son Richie,Andrew J. Ferchlad. But it's baseball,not job or family, that's Gil's true love. And it's in Bobby Rayburn that Gil a former little league baseball pitcher lives out his fantasy life as a major league baseball player. That's in Gil doing in Juan Primo, Beniclo De Toro, with a hunting knife in a hotel bath-house to get Bobby's number #11 back on his Giants jersey. Bobby the 40 million dollar man, that's what the Giants higher ups were paying him, who was in a king size slump all season now, with Primo gone and his famed #11 back, started hitting up to expectations.\n\nIt's later on when Gil just happened to be around to save Bobby's eight year old son Sean, Brandon Hammond, from almost drowning in the Pacific Ocean that his high opinions about Bobby drastically changed. Invited into Bobby's beach house for a bottle of beer and a game of pool, which is the least he could do for him, Gil is disgusted in Bobby's opinion about the game of baseball! Which Bobby treats as a game and way to make big bucks, 40 million of them, not the religion that Gil feel that it is! With everything that he did to get Bobby back in the grove in both hitting and fielding, by murdering his top rival on the team Juan Primo, Gil feels that he's not being given him the credit by Bobby, who has no idea what Gil did for him, that he so rightfully deserves. And with that and outraged and dejected Gil plans to make Bobby's life both personal and professional into a living hell on earth!\n\n***SPOILERS*** The movie "The Fan" is really a one man show with Robert De Niro at center stage doing his thing, being off the wall crazy, that he and only he can do best. Not only is De Niro or Gil Renard completely out of his mind but also omnipresent, like some kind of Deity, in seeming to be everywhere and everyplace at the same time. Gil's craziness goes so far as kidnapping Bobby's son Sean and even going farther in murdering his little league hero, his battery mate, Coop, Charles Hallahan, when he himself realized just how crazy Gil his one time best friend really was.\n\nThe ending of the movie was a bit too much to take with Gil going all out to get Bobby to publicly acknowledge what he did for him in front of a sold out crowd at Candlestick Park and on top of all that hit a home run for him! If not Bobby's son Sean would become history. The film fell apart with Candlestick Park being hit by hurricane force winds with a tropical downpour added in yet the game that should have been called because of rain is still allowed to go on. Only to have Gil make his grand appearance, you'll never guess as who, out of nowhere and mess up Bobby's home run that he hit for him! Still the film is worth watching for Roert De Niro incredible but very natural,for him, performance. A so out of control and psychotic performance That even tops De Niro's own crazed and deranged interpretation of a homicidal lunatic gone wild in "Cape Fear" some six years earlier.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":47763,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1996-08-16","keywords":"obsession,insanity,psychopath,baseball,salesman","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Fan","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi301072665","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjZhM2QyY2MtYzE2NC00MDIzLTg4NGUtZmFlYTA1ZmZjNGQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjZhM2QyY2MtYzE2NC00MDIzLTg4NGUtZmFlYTA1ZmZjNGQ0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Columbia Tristar","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000134/","name":"Robert De Niro","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000648/","name":"Wesley Snipes","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000289/","name":"Ellen Barkin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001716/","name":"Tony Scott"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005883/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0033437/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0074212/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0009029/","name":"Peter Abrahams","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0840380/","name":"Phoef Sutton"],"duration":"PT1H56M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I felt like it was trying too hard to be too many things.  Using a mixture of various film makers styles it just didn't seem to provide anything fresh. The story telling method used too many twists to work successfully. If stylish visuals and multi layered stories are your main thing then give it a go.

I say oddly because Isabelle Adjani and Sharon Stone are together on the screen for almost the entire film and the two actresses truly bring out the best in each other. So you have a long series of well-played scenes by fine actresses, but they are strung together into a slow paced story line that lacks unity and consistent motivation. Which could be caused by a lot of things but is most likely the result of trimming in post-production, in which important unifying elements were left on the cutting room floor. Or it could be that the director and production designer just failed to translate the writer's vision onto the screen.\n\nSince this ultimately this is a story about an evil character who develops a sentimental side, it is absolutely critical that this process is communicated to the audience. The audience should not just be surprised by the ending but should be able to think back and see all the motivational pieces click into place. In this regard the movie is a complete failure.\n\nThen there is the issue of cheating. Because we only know what he wants to tell us, a director has a variety of legit ways to introduce misdirection and surprise into a film. But occasionally a director lacks the integrity and vision to play by the rules. Such is the case here as only the audience sees the underwater shot of a clearly drowned Guy (Chazz Palminteri). It is shown to convince us that he is dead but this then makes his reanimation impossible. Plus it is fairly useless because you know that he has to come back for there to be much of a story. That is cheating and there is more cheating in the unintentionally comical climatic scene. The beauty of the original movie was the absence of cheating and the macabre irony of the ending. All that is missing.\n\nWhatever, it means that the only reason to watch this version of "Diabolique" is for the acting of Adjani and Stone. Although Adjani was 40-41 years old when she made this film, she has lost little of her beauty. While she was probably the world's most beautiful actress in her twenties, there is simply no debate that she was the most beautiful 40 year-old in cinema history. Stone pretty much plays her hard-as-nails self but she is given some great lines and her character is a great contrast to the ethereal take Adjani gives to her own character.\n\nIf you are looking for a better but less obvious remake of the original "Diabolique", track down 1971's "Let's Scare Jessica To Death". This almost forgotten horror classic is truly scary. It has much better production design than 1996's "Diabolique", with creepy whispering and images that stay with you and creep you out even weeks later. Jessica is a woman recently released from a mental "institution" who goes to a farm in a quiet rural area. The odd locals and their local legends begin to mess with Jessica's head as her husband and his secret girlfriend attempt to scare her to death.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14109,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1996-10-28","keywords":"stockings,woman on top,dead body in a bathtub,dead body in a car,death in a bathtub","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Diabolique","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi950141209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000254/","name":"Isabelle Adjani"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154819/","name":"Jeremiah S.

Loved it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":32227,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-08-07","keywords":"sheriff,stealing a car,police car,child uses a gun,child with a gun","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Cop Car","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3722164761","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2NjNDdjNTctZTQ0Mi00NDRjLTljN2EtYjU4N2I0YWZjOWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2NjNDdjNTctZTQ0Mi00NDRjLTljN2EtYjU4N2I0YWZjOWRmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Cop Car","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000102/","name":"Kevin Bacon","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6627667/","name":"James Freedson-Jackson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4881741/","name":"Hays Wellford"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1218281/","name":"Jon Watts"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0424445/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0422626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0541701/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1218281/","name":"Jon Watts","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1755986/","name":"Christopher Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12754932/","name":"Kaden Selvidge"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It still doesn't beat John Wayne though.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":401,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7,"genre":["Western"],"datePublished":"2003-07-12","keywords":"apache indian,arizona territory,yuma arizona,yuma territorial prison,territorial prison","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000608/","name":"Burt Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001136/","name":"Bruce Dern","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005057/","name":"Amy Jo Johnson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0229638/","name":"Frank Q.

There is a father/son relationship (Charles Shaunessy and Clive Revill) that is touching and real, funny and even corny at times.

I can't continue the review without issuing a SPOILER alert since I will be discussing critical movie facts. The movie was very spookily lit with looming shadows and false colors and was expertly designed. The creatures living below ground were creepy and scary since often they were only glimpsed in the shadows. I hadn't expected the death count to be so high nor the movie to be so bloody. I flinched often during the movie due to the sudden appearance of the creatures or from the wounds suffered by the cast. The pace of the movie once they began the cave exploration was very fast and of course with this type of movie a deeper examination of the facts reveals some plot holes but events move too fast for reflection. I can't say I liked or agreed with some events in the end of the movie. I think Juno, maybe not the best person in the group, was unfairly judged and condemned. None the less the movie was very effective in scaring me and holding my attention. The fact that it had, primarily, an all women cast was hardly noticeable. This is not a chick flic.

The creatures living below ground were creepy and scary since often they were only glimpsed in the shadows. I hadn't expected the death count to be so high nor the movie to be so bloody. I flinched often during the movie due to the sudden appearance of the creatures or from the wounds suffered by the cast. The pace of the movie once they began the cave exploration was very fast and of course with this type of movie a deeper examination of the facts reveals some plot holes but events move too fast for reflection. I can't say I liked or agreed with some events in the end of the movie. I think Juno, maybe not the best person in the group, was unfairly judged and condemned. None the less the movie was very effective in scaring me and holding my attention. The fact that it had, primarily, an all women cast was hardly noticeable. This is not a chick flic. Worth seeing.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":214767,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Adventure","Horror","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-03-22","keywords":"cave,survival horror,fear,group of friends,monster","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Descent","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2810904857","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTNmMDg5MzMtZDJjNi00NDYzLWExZjEtNmE0ZDJlOGY3MWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTNmMDg5MzMtZDJjNi00NDYzLWExZjEtNmE0ZDJlOGY3MWVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Lionsgate Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531933/","name":"Shauna Macdonald","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413238/","name":"Natalie Mendoza","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0717157/","name":"Alex Reid"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0551076/","name":"Neil Marshall"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0152921/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0109425/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0068747/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0551076/","name":"Neil Marshall"],"duration":"PT1H39M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This is the same studio that has made a living producing small budget films to the urban community like Obsessed, No Good Deed, and When the Bough Breaks. While they have all maintained solid profitability, I have found all of their filmmaking and writing severely lacking any thrills and under utilizing their lead actors. So I found myself walking into Proud Mary expecting a familiar feeling, but a slight sense of naive optimism.\n\nMary (Taraji P. Henson) plays a hitman who learns she kills the parent of a young boy during a assigned hit. Over the year, she oversees his wellness and takes him in and notices the strain it brings between her and her higher up (Danny Glover) and her previous lover (Billy Brown).\n\nWhile some of the films budget limits can be seen, the film is able to bring some decent performances from Billy Brown and some decent "gun-fu" action. The finale has a fleeting moment of some engaging action, but it feels all too brief and too dimly lit to take in the stunt's Taraji did. There are fleeting moments when the film is able to not take itself so seriously, particularly one scene when the credits begin to roll which I wish the film committed itself to that certain feeling more often.\n\nWhile I am not surprised the boss subplot is irrelevant, it still amazes me how little we know about Mary as a character. Her backstory is almost inexistent, which is bothersome given she's such a motherly character but still feels too locked to her own thoughts. The villain's also have no gravitas, as they never physically challenge Mary and feel like faceless dummies to show off Taraji's fighting abilities. And the little boy can be very annoying and all over the place at times. One moment he plays as a hardened street kid and the next a whiny child.\n\nProud Mary thankfully isn't the disaster I was worried it would be, but it's not as committed to the over the top action I wished it was. While the mother-son dynamic allows for a softer criminal, the emotional impact doesn't feel earned. The 70s music choices are on the nose at times, but loosens up the film at points. To put it simply, Proud Mary comes to the fight strapped with a half empty clip.\n\nRating: 5.0/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9663,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-01-12","keywords":"hitwoman,woman boy relationship,silencer,assassin,reloading a gun","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1926150425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRmMWQ2MTctYzcwYS00MTQ0LWJiMDItMGMyMTBkY2Y2NzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2ODc0MjY@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWRmMWQ2MTctYzcwYS00MTQ0LWJiMDItMGMyMTBkY2Y2NzYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTk2ODc0MjY@._V1_.jpg","description":"An assassin meets a young boy who sparks her maternal instinct."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0378245/","name":"Taraji P.

This movie is pure fun! Actually, it's more than fun; it's clever and perfectly 2018. \n\n No one plays board games anymore, so what did the filmmakers do? They changed Jumanji into a video game. Simple, yet smart. This change not only made sense, it also opened the doors for the characters to possess and exhibit wildly over-the-top skills and physical abilities that would only make sense in a video game setting. \n\n Also perfectly 2018, the handling of Karen Gillan's short shorts. The film earnestly attempts to comment on how video games exploit female characters in blatantly sexual ways. "Why am I wearing short shorts in the jungle?!" she exclaims. This scene is well done and could have made a worthy statement if the movie did not proceed to display her booty in the short shorts at multiple junctures throughout the film. The intentions were good; the execution, not so much.\n\n Gillan plays a powerful female badass exceptionally well. She even nails the necessary nuances required in playing a shy, unconfident student who is merely inhabiting the avatar of the female badass. Each star in the movie plays the embodiment of an avatar assumed by the high school kids after they are sucked into the Jumanji video game. I understand that the last sentence sounds ridiculous. That's Jumanji. You have to tolerate a bit of ridiculous.   Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, and Jack Black all deliver in their roles. Hart is hilarious. Black reminds us that he is still funny. Jack Black should be in more funny movies. Johnson is equal parts funny and charming to such an obscene level that it almost doesn't make sense. He's at the point now that he can still be wonderful and charming, even if the movie around him falls woefully flat (shout out to Baywatch).\n\n Setting much of the film in a video game also excused an exceedingly simple plot. The movie embraces this. With all the funny lines, the best one comes when at one point someone asks a video game character in a car "why can't you just drive us where we need to go?" At that moment I realized that this movie knows exactly what it is.\n\n Still, the movie is not perfect. Bobby Canavale's villain character is strange in a strange way, rather than strange in a cool way. The dialogue has its flaws too. At one point, Jack Black's character gives a pep talk to Karen Gillan's character about confidence. At first, it seems like a lovely speech that tells a teenage girl that she has value because of who she is as a person. Then it abruptly ends with "I'm just saying you're a babe." Oh, so physical attractiveness is what gives her value? Ugh. Once again, they were so close to delivering a worthwhile message, but fell just short.\n\n These faults are only slight hiccups. Most viewers probably will barely notice them. They certainly didn't ruin my enjoyment of the movie. Above all else, the movie is about fun. And on that aspect, it comes through with flying colors.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":352586,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2017-12-20","keywords":"jungle,trapped in a game,title based on song,song in title,high school","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3413817625","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BODUxNzE5MDI1NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTAwNzE2MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four teenagers discover an old video game console and are literally drawn into the game's jungle setting becoming the adult avatars they choose."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0425005/","name":"Dwayne Johnson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2394794/","name":"Karen Gillan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366389/","name":"Kevin Hart"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0440458/","name":"Jake Kasdan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332017/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023815/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003298/","name":"Scott Rosenberg"}],"duration":"PT1H59M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The film's action-packed finale scene, a climatic showdown in the midst of an incredibly rough hurricane, is thoroughly effective and satisfying.

Just like in the first movie, he is able to carry the film on all of its levels from beginning to end. That said, the film does have one large flaw--that of which the story is highly predictable.

Certainly, no one would make a Will Smith movie about a guy who breaks under the strain of his difficult life, abandons his child and dies. That's just not going to happen. And because we know that -- because we've seen more than one movie in our lives -- "The Pursuit of Happiness" has a particular challenge: To take the real-life rags-to-riches story of stockbroker Chris Gardner, a story with a preordained happy ending, and imbue it with tension and suspense.\n\nThe great surprise of the picture is that it's not corny. It may have seemed that way from the trailer: Will Smith tells his son, "Don't ever let anyone tell you that you can't do something -- even me." But in context, even that moment isn't cloying. The beauty of the film is its honesty. In its outlines, it's nothing like the usual success story depicted on screen, in which, after a reasonable interval of disappointment, success arrives wrapped in a ribbon and a bow. Instead, this success story follows the pattern most common in life -- it chronicles a series of soul-sickening failures and defeats, missed opportunities, sure things that didn't quite happen, all of which are accompanied by a concomitant accretion of barely perceptible victories that gradually amount to something. In other words, it all feels real.\n\nGabriele Muccino ("L'Ultimo Bacio") directed it, and his fine Italian hand can be detected in Andrea Guerra's score, with its Italianate wistfulness and whimsicality, and in Muccino's very European enjoyment of American poverty and desperation. He finds both on the streets of San Francisco -- circa 1981, in this case, but some things don't change -- and he films them in a way that we're always aware: Our hero works hard. He's doing everything he can, and he has a son he is raising on his own. Yet even without a false move on his part, just an extra push of bad luck, he might land on those streets, and with such a thud he might never rise.\n\nAs in all rags-to-riches tales, we find the protagonist, Chris, unappreciated and looked down upon at the start. He is struggling to make a go of it by selling bone-density scanners and spends his days lugging around a thing that looks like a movie projector case and hearing doctors tell him they're not interested. His wife disdains him. Actually, the treatment of the wife is the first hint that "The Pursuit of Happiness" is going to be an usually uncompromising movie. The wife (Thandie Newton) is a poisonous harpie, with no redeeming traits. The filmmakers are not messing around: Chris has it bad.\n\nIn fact, he is an extraordinary man, but no one is paying attention to him long enough to notice. He decides he wants to get an internship as a stockbroker for Dean Witter and, realizing that his resume looks weak, he sets out to meet the man in charge and say a few words on his own behalf. Throughout the film, had Chris had just a little more pride and a little less intelligence, he would blow it. But he remains friendly and resilient, never indulging in anger, never letting anyone else's mistaken perception of him wound him at his core. He stays fixed on his objective and warm in his response to the world -- and even then, things don't improve right away.\n\nHaving proceeded to establish Chris as a great guy, "The Pursuit of Happiness" puts him through hell. The wife leaving is just the beginning (actually that seems a little like good luck). Chris has to raise a son (played by Will Smith's own real-life son, Jaden Christopher Syre Smith) and do an unpaid internship, while selling those bone-density scanners on the side. If it weren't for the soup kitchens at Glide Memorial, he and his son often wouldn't eat.\n\nWill Smith has the right quality for the role -- he's an easy man to root for -- but he augments this by channeling some inner quality of desperation and need. Frankly, I don't know where he found it; Smith was touched by luck at a very young age. Yet he does find it. In the taxicab scene, in which he tries to impress a prospective employer by solving the Rubik's Cube, and in every other scene in which Chris has to sit or stand there smiling while another man pronounces on his fate, Smith is right there with the right emotions: absolute hope and total terror.\n\nThis film is an amazing heartfelt performance certain to influence and motivate its audience to reach new heights. This film is based on a true gripping and dramatic story about a man who has nothing and his struggle toward success. The plot development can be slow but offers a lot of insight towards character development and explore these themes about patience and success and especially what motivates us and keeps us going. I recommend for everyone to watch this, whether rich businessman, student, or teacher for this will change everyone's perspective on life.\n\nIn short - Amazing movie. Very poignant, relevant and uplifting. Leaves you thinking about it for days!!","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":481214,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-02-07","keywords":"motivational,passion,hardwork,hare krishna,american dream","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Pursuit of Happyness","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1413719065","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWQxODIxNmMtN2ViYi00OTRiLWE4Y2MtZDRiZmE1MDI5ZTVmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Pursuit of Happyness"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0628601/","name":"Thandiwe Newton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1535523/","name":"Jaden Smith"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0610831/","name":"Gabriele Muccino"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0072775/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0175726/","name":"Steve Conrad"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Kevin Costner takes the title role and proves to be handsome enough and swashbuckling enough to do justice to the role during the action scenes.

Robin of Locksley, a young soldier, returns from the Crusades to find the city of Nottingham and its surrounding area terrorised by the evil Sherrif of Nottingham (Alan Rickman). Robin takes refuge in the nearby Sherwood Forest, where he gathers a band of woodland outlaws who are always stealing money and treasure taken by the Sherrif and giving it back to the poor. His dashing antics impress Maid Marian (Mary Elisabeth Mastrantonio), a childhood friend, and he quickly becomes popular with the poor and honest folk who nickname him Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves.\n\n The film is very old-fashioned, but it occasionally gives away its 1991 release status with modern touches (the fancy camera-work in which the camera is seemingly fixed upon an arrow as it is fired at a target; the introduction of a Moorish warrior character [Morgan Freeman] to broaden the film's cultural reference; Rickman's self-deprecating pantomimic turn as the wicked Sherrif). On the whole, it is an entertaining film with a good balance between the action and the romance. The best performance - surprisingly - comes from Michael Wincott who oozes menace as the Sherrif's despicable cousin Guy of Gisbourne. There are some quite significant factual errors, the best (by "best" I mean "funniest") of which is when Robin and his Moorish companion stand at the foot of the white cliffs of Dover and Robin tells him: "by nightfall we will dine with my father!"

I like Will Smith, I like Martin Lawrence, so I figured this film will at least be funny.  And it was funny, and then some.  It was action packed, thrilling and a helluva good time.  I came out of the theatre thinking that the guy who directed that movie is going to be huge.\n\nMichael Bay, former music video and commercial director, has made an incredible directorial debut.  The film never stops.  When it isn't action-packed, it is funny.  It is sexy, fun and always moving.  Christian Wagner's editing is phenomenal.  I love action movies that really try to be action movies.  A lot of action films know that they are action films so they try to incorporate other genres to make the film more complete, but they often fail miserably.  They try so hard to be something they are not that they forget what they are in the first place. The essence of the action film is the action. It is a necessary component, it needs to be there otherwise it loses its edge. "Bad Boys" doesn't just throw in the occassional action sequence to meet the expectations of the genre, but instead uses the action to help tell the story.  It is this use of filmmaking that allows an action film to remain an action film and still go beyond.\n\nWatch "Bad Boys" again and every time there is an action sequence, ask yourself why that was there and what did it accomplish.  You will find that each sequence took the film to another level; it introduced an new conflict, it increased the present conflict, it eliminated a key character, it introduced a new character, and so on.  There are a lot of action films out there that sacrifice story for spectacle, and the audience notices this.  At the centre of all films lies the story and if it comes to a halt so does the interest of the viewers.\n\n"Bad Boys" of course isn't the greatest story on film, or even in the action genre, but what is so appealing and memorable about "Bad Boys" is that it is just as entertaining with its story as it is with its action by combining the two without sacrificing either.  Michael Bay understands the importance of the story within the structure of the film.  He tells a visual story, entertaining and complete, and leaves you very satisfied.

It was a lot of fun.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":464352,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2008-07-02","keywords":"superhero,black superhero,non comic book superhero,tough girl,destruction","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Hancock: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2497904921","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MjY1MjU1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk2NzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg3MjY1MjU1MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjk2NzMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second theatrical trailer for Hancock, directed by Peter Berg.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000226/","name":"Will Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000234/","name":"Charlize Theron","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000867/","name":"Jason Bateman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000916/","name":"Peter Berg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0237209/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1378206/","name":"Vy Vincent Ngo","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0319213/","name":"Vince Gilligan"],"duration":"PT1H32M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 2819924, Title: Candice Renoir, 
 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen. Candice is like a female Columbo version in high heels, handbag pink scarf and a 9mm in her holster." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt2819924/","name":"Candice Renoir","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOWM3YzUxM2UtZjIyMC00Zjg5LTk0NTMtNGQ3ZWQ0ODhlMTJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjc0NTExNDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

Acting, camera work, jokes, and banter between coworkers, all served to create a believable environment. And that dark past of his, just waiting to be revealed and possibly destroy everything, hovers in the background, creating tension. I find myself waiting for the next episode. One reviewer complains about there being a personal story behind the main character, but that's how we end up finding out about that mysterious past of his. And, seriously, what do they want?

    <desc lang="pl">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 2819924, Title: Candice Renoir, 
 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

Acting, camera work, jokes, and banter between coworkers, all served to create a believable environment. And that dark past of his, just waiting to be revealed and possibly destroy everything, hovers in the background, creating tension. I find myself waiting for the next episode. One reviewer complains about there being a personal story behind the main character, but that's how we end up finding out about that mysterious past of his. And, seriously, what do they want?

Probably the story could have been told with 4-5 seasons easily. But it is what it is. Last, camera work, make up and sound are pretty cool. I can't believe this show started on 2002. On the other hand, seems some characters were not fully developed or look like the writers didn't want to give them credit. But not a big thing.

    <desc lang="pl">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

 --- Description: Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

    <desc lang="pl">Candice Renoir: Created by Robin Barataud, Brigitte Peskine, Solen Roy-Pagenault. With Cécile Bois, Raphaël Lenglet, Clara Antoons, Ali Marhyar. The story circles around French police officer Commandant Candice Renoir and her team solving different crime cases in a harbor city of south France. Candice herself is a mother of 4 children and recently divorced. Her daily routine is between solving crimes, taking out fights with her much younger female police superior officer, getting her kids to school - in addition - handling their problems too and keeping her team in line. It's a very funny and witty series with a lot of french charm and intelligent story writing. Not another dull crime series all over again. It's like a fresh french breeze on the TV screen.

During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  \n\nThis is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).\n\nIn conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.

Lets face it, if they had all just been sitting there doing nothing it would still have been a highly successful film. People would have paid to see them organise their sock draws. However, this time around with a brand new script and an immensely prosperous cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original.\n\nIn the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it. Firstly because of the fact that they all took pay cuts so that it could happen and secondly because it comes across on screen. The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.\n\nIt is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.\n\nIt is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.\n\nOcean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.\n\nAdmittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!\n\nThis is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director. But that is why it is so much better than the archetypal Hollywood blockbusters that we have come to expect.\n\nThis is no run of the mill film. It was not about money or self promotion. It was about having fun and enjoying the job. Ocean's Eleven is not a film that will be forgotten seconds after you have seen it. It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545847,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-20","keywords":"casino,heist,criminal mastermind,card dealer,ulcer","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Eleven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1822294297","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

Lets face it, if they had all just been sitting there doing nothing it would still have been a highly successful film. People would have paid to see them organise their sock draws. However, this time around with a brand new script and an immensely prosperous cast and crew we have ended up with a film ten times better than the original.\n\nIn the case of this adaption we are safe in the knowledge that the actors at least wanted to be there and that they all had fun making it. Firstly because of the fact that they all took pay cuts so that it could happen and secondly because it comes across on screen. The easy friendship between Clooney, Pitt, Roberts et al shines throughout the film and seems to draw the audience in to their inner circle. We know they had a good time filming it just as we are having a good time watching it.\n\nIt is easy to say that this is THE coolest film of the year. From the phenomenal script and direction from Steven Soderbergh to the impeccable easy going performances of the 'stars' - yes every single one of them! With so many big names you would expect some rivalry yet there is no scene hogging in sight. It is clear to see that they are all willing to share the limelight. The fact is that there is no main character or personality. They are all in it together - reflecting the sense of the film in real life. This is the first concept the audience sees from the poster. The names are printed in alphabetical order. Nobody is given priority. Clooney plays Danny Ocean with the same self - confidence, composure and unmistakable coll that hasn't been seen since Sinatra himself. All the other characters are brand new, that is except for the character of Tess Ocean (Julia Roberts). In the 60s original Tess, played by Angie Dickinson, is Ocean's defender (to some extent). However, Roberts' re-vamped character is more self assured and unmoved by Ocean's charm. Rusty (Pitt) is rarely seen without snack in hand and the suit are certainly something to look at. He may be a new character but he is still played in the carefree manner typical of the Rat Pack.\n\nIt is refreshing to sit and watch a film such as this and not have to suffer the usual barrage of swearing and violence. The lack of such profanities only increases its wide appeal. It just goes to show that it can be done and that films do not neccessarily need it.\n\nOcean's Eleven is not your typical heist movie. To start with there are eleven people working together all with specific, indispensable jobs to do. Yet the mood is still light hearted which makes it even more compelling to watch. The inspired direction and flowing script assure that there is never a dull moment and that every scene is important, as is every character. There are also a couple of cameo appearances from some other big names to look out for.\n\nAdmittedly there is a bad side as there is in every film. In this instance it is Don Cheadles's cockney accent. Nice try but not quite right!\n\nThis is a film that will keep you fascinated the entire time you are watching. It does not conform to the conventional values of the genre that we have come to expect. The twists and turns guarantee that by the end you will be sitting there thinking 'that was really clever'. Perhaps it isn't quite what you would expect from such a star studded cast and an Oscar winning director. But that is why it is so much better than the archetypal Hollywood blockbusters that we have come to expect.\n\nThis is no run of the mill film. It was not about money or self promotion. It was about having fun and enjoying the job. Ocean's Eleven is not a film that will be forgotten seconds after you have seen it. It will live forever as the epitome of cool for years to come.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":545847,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Crime","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2002-03-20","keywords":"casino,heist,criminal mastermind,card dealer,ulcer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Ocean's Eleven","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1822294297","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWFmYzc5YTUtOTczNC00YjJhLWJiZWMtYWNhMTBiOWY2Njc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Warner Bros.

During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  \n\nThis is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).\n\nIn conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.

But in THE LONGEST RIDE, the attempt barely mimics such success, primarily because of its confusing and ever shifting narrative, whose backbone runs on two romantic sagas spanning across different generations.\n\nTHE LONGEST RIDE sprawls across two love stories set in the modern day and seventy years ago. In modern day, it has Luke and Sophia, two utterly good-looking people, who at first sight falls in love with each other, they stumbles upon Ira, a World War II veteran, who himself, has his own epic love story to tell—that one he shared with his wife, Ruth, seventy years ago. More often, these two love stories bear no difference from each other, as both couples go through similar hardships to carry their relationships.\n\nThe idea of crisscrossing time to present two supposedly compelling love stories, perhaps, is to double the magnitude of emotions and deliver a more poignant result, yet such very confusing structure is what actually makes giving both the stories with equal level of sentiment, difficult. Still, no matter how one appears to hold more promise of an engaging love story than the other, the tedious and confusing process of going back and forth across two different time frames, and the fact that the narrative failed to establish concrete connection between the two stories, renders less than satisfying result. There's also this chemistry that Luke and Sophia seem to be lacking, regardless of how incredibly beautiful they are as persons, and that, may also be the reason why the other story, strikes as more riveting than theirs. This makes the entirety of the movie—its interesting premise and structure yet often convoluted, and its thinly drawn characters—hard to appreciate and care about. Nevertheless, in the eyes of a true Sparks' fan, and of anyone easily drawn to such anthems, THE LONGEST RIDE easily serves its purpose.\n\nSpanning through generations and intertwining love affairs, THE LONGESTh RIDE would have been more satisfying had it treated both the stories with equal attention.

Director Stephen Johnsons' "High Ground" is no exception. It's the little things...always the little things like the sound effects of a bird eating its prey or a lizard scratching on the bark of a tree, and even green ants munching on flora that make this film so intimate and at times feels like I'm watching a Clint Eastwood cowboy flick. The break out role for Indigenous actor Jacob Junior Nayin ggul as Gutjuk (which means Hawk) is outstanding and not to be overshadowed by legendary actors like Simon Baker, Jack Thompson, Callan Mulvey or fellow Aboriginal actor Aaron Pederson. "High Ground" is a brutal retelling of our First Nations Peoples horrific treatment at the hands of the British Colonists to their country...all in the name of the Crown. Its Australia's answer to similar action in other countries like the British colonisation of the Americas and their treatment of the Natives. It's a familiar story around the globe. None of it is pretty, except the Country itself. This is up close and personal from the perspective of both the Colonials and the local tribes and the disastrous results of these encounters. "High Ground" is set against the stunning landscape of 1930's Arnhem Land. Sacred land for Northern Territory tribes that live there to this day. Bakers' Travis and Gutjuk are out to track down warring wild tribesman and Uncle, Baywarra, played by Sean Mununggurr. Whilst his own Granfather Dharrpa (Witiyana Marika) is trying to make peace and seek justice for the deaths of his family by the Colonial Soldiers. On this journey in the outback who can you really trust? Simon Baker in his 50's is making superb movies including Breath (Netflix) This movie was first screened in an open air theatre in Western Australia with a near full capacity crowd. Made all the more remarkable because not many places in the world can host large crowds during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Cinemas around the world are in desperate need of content to fill their big screens right now and Australia is delivering the goods with first class films for the world to watch. Movies like "High Ground" make you understand why some people are uncomfortable with Australia Day (the official national day of Australia) and protest its anniversary. Observed annually on 26 January, it marks the 1788 raising of the British flag at Sydney Cove by Arthur Phillip following days of exploration in New South Wales by the First Fleet.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-01-28","keywords":"topless woman,bare breasts,shooting,spearing,aboriginal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3634085913","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZlZDA5MzYtOWE3ZS00M2MzLTg4YzYtMWIyMGYzYTliMTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZlZDA5MzYtOWE3ZS00M2MzLTg4YzYtMWIyMGYzYTliMTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Gutjuk teams up with ex-sniper Travis to track down the most dangerous warrior in the Territory, who is also his uncle.

 --- Description: Wino truskawkowe: Directed by Dariusz Jablonski. With Jirí Machácek, Zuzana Fialová, Marian Dziedziel, Mieczyslaw Grabka. This is not a love story though it is full of love. It is not a comedy though the characters often say funny things. It is not a detective story even though the hero is trying to solve a murder. It is not a nature drama though it shows the splendid colours and customs of the countryside. It is not a musical though Lubica expresses her longing in a passionate dance. Nor is it a film about ghosts though a ghost does ask the hero for a favour.

It is my second fave horror anthology(ABCs of Death just! beating it) and is a horror film I love very fondly. If you haven't seen it, see it!\n\nPart 2 was full of bad camera work, worse acting, and some of the most bonkers stuff you could think of to put on screen. It is a Z grade film, that gets everything so wrong on a technical level that it becomes oddly charming. In other words it is a pure so bad it's good and I find it hilarious. A lot of people hate it(and I can see why!) but I love it for much the same reason so many people like Troll 2.\n\nBut that of course asks, what kind of film would part 3 be? A cult classic social commentary dark horror film like the original, or a trash fire comedy miss step like part 2?\n\nWell part 3 feels very much like it was made in response to the bad feed back part 2 got. The film plays itself VERY safe. Only one of the four stories is even actually a commentary on racism. The rest could take place in any old anthology series. All the stories are a lot more down to Earth and much less over the top then anything was in part 2, or even the original. This does make the film pretty predictable. Since it is playing things so held back and safe you will be able to call out the plot twists well before they happen. A lot of people are going to complain that this film is very paint by numbers and formulaic.\n\nBUT along with playing things much more by the numbers the film makes itself much more competently. Camera work, good, acting good, pacing, good. Nothing is AMAZING! But there are no bad miss steps anywhere besides some weak CGI here and there. I do feel the one story about racism, the second one, is pretty darn good and feels like it would have been at home in the first film. The third story, though as said it could be from any horror anthology series, is still a good story that is well done and charming. It also has the first queer character for the series! Cool! :) The other two stories though predictable are by no means bad. So yes, this is an anthology with not a single bad story! Which is pretty good in my book.\n\nYa, you can nit pick it(the idea of this like six year old telling a grown man about a story where a man has sex with a blowup doll is pretty wonderfully absurd), but if you do you'll be just hating it for hating it sake.\n\nNo, this is a light going, turn your mind off, grab some Halloween candy with friends, kind of horror film. It's time killer, but very well done time killer and I think fans of the original will be over all pleased.\n\n6.8 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":761,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2020-10-06","keywords":"anthology,camera shot from inside a refrigerator,beaten to death,burned alive,gore","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8358598/","name":"Patrick Abellard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11051116/","name":"Frederick Allen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11086603/","name":"Djouliet Amara"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192090/","name":"Rusty Cundieff"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779011/","name":"Darin Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0359888/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192090/","name":"Rusty Cundieff"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779011/","name":"Darin Scott"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It is my second fave horror anthology(ABCs of Death just! beating it) and is a horror film I love very fondly. If you haven't seen it, see it!\n\nPart 2 was full of bad camera work, worse acting, and some of the most bonkers stuff you could think of to put on screen. It is a Z grade film, that gets everything so wrong on a technical level that it becomes oddly charming. In other words it is a pure so bad it's good and I find it hilarious. A lot of people hate it(and I can see why!) but I love it for much the same reason so many people like Troll 2.\n\nBut that of course asks, what kind of film would part 3 be? A cult classic social commentary dark horror film like the original, or a trash fire comedy miss step like part 2?\n\nWell part 3 feels very much like it was made in response to the bad feed back part 2 got. The film plays itself VERY safe. Only one of the four stories is even actually a commentary on racism. The rest could take place in any old anthology series. All the stories are a lot more down to Earth and much less over the top then anything was in part 2, or even the original. This does make the film pretty predictable. Since it is playing things so held back and safe you will be able to call out the plot twists well before they happen. A lot of people are going to complain that this film is very paint by numbers and formulaic.\n\nBUT along with playing things much more by the numbers the film makes itself much more competently. Camera work, good, acting good, pacing, good. Nothing is AMAZING! But there are no bad miss steps anywhere besides some weak CGI here and there. I do feel the one story about racism, the second one, is pretty darn good and feels like it would have been at home in the first film. The third story, though as said it could be from any horror anthology series, is still a good story that is well done and charming. It also has the first queer character for the series! Cool! :) The other two stories though predictable are by no means bad. So yes, this is an anthology with not a single bad story! Which is pretty good in my book.\n\nYa, you can nit pick it(the idea of this like six year old telling a grown man about a story where a man has sex with a blowup doll is pretty wonderfully absurd), but if you do you'll be just hating it for hating it sake.\n\nNo, this is a light going, turn your mind off, grab some Halloween candy with friends, kind of horror film. It's time killer, but very well done time killer and I think fans of the original will be over all pleased.\n\n6.8 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":761,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.9},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Horror"],"datePublished":"2020-10-06","keywords":"anthology,camera shot from inside a refrigerator,beaten to death,burned alive,gore","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8358598/","name":"Patrick Abellard"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11051116/","name":"Frederick Allen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11086603/","name":"Djouliet Amara"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192090/","name":"Rusty Cundieff"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779011/","name":"Darin Scott"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0359888/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192090/","name":"Rusty Cundieff"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779011/","name":"Darin Scott"}],"duration":"PT1H42M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The movie is about a man who is accused of murder with no real evidence except for his name, which happens to be Jurek Kiler. He gets himself into a much deeper situation throughout the movie. There are several real funny lines in the movie, but I doubt they are quite as funny when translated into English. Jerzy Stuhr, arguably Poland's greatest actor, plays the lead detective and anything he says is funny. In Polish comedies the humor is not so much in what is said, but how it is said. The humor for the most part comes from the ironic tones and facial expressions of the actors. For those who are not familiar with Polish film history the first, and for a long time only, film making academy was in Poland. Many of the camera crews, set directors, and props directors from Hollywood were actually educated at this Polish institute. I hope you enjoy the film.

The movie is about a man who is accused of murder with no real evidence except for his name, which happens to be Jurek Kiler. He gets himself into a much deeper situation throughout the movie. There are several real funny lines in the movie, but I doubt they are quite as funny when translated into English. Jerzy Stuhr, arguably Poland's greatest actor, plays the lead detective and anything he says is funny. In Polish comedies the humor is not so much in what is said, but how it is said. The humor for the most part comes from the ironic tones and facial expressions of the actors. For those who are not familiar with Polish film history the first, and for a long time only, film making academy was in Poland. Many of the camera crews, set directors, and props directors from Hollywood were actually educated at this Polish institute. I hope you enjoy the film. Cheers.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6647,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"1997-11-17","keywords":"character name as title,serial murder,surname as title,one word title,police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0668640/","name":"Cezary Pazura","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0469021/","name":"Malgorzata Kozuchowska","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0836136/","name":"Jerzy Stuhr"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532702/","name":"Juliusz Machulski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093411/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093398/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0921264/","name":"Piotr Weresniak"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Unknown to them, however, one of their victims works for a vicious local gangster named Doyle Lonnegan, and when Lonnegan finds out what has happened he has Luther murdered. Hooker is not a violent man by nature and admits that he does not know much about killing, but nevertheless wishes to take revenge for his partner's death. He decides that the best way is to hurt Lonnegan's pride by relieving him of some of his wealth. He joins forces with another con man named Henry Gondorff, and together they come up with an elaborate plan, not only to cheat Lonnegan, but also to do it in such a way that he never realises that he has been cheated. The plot unfolds with great ingenuity; until the final denouement the audience are never quite sure which developments are for real and which are part of the elaborate scheme.\n\nCrime thrillers set during this period are normally associated with the classic `film noir' style, with its dark, brooding, cynical atmosphere. In `The Sting', however, George Roy Hill deliberately sets out to create a very different mood. The style is almost the exact opposite of film noir. The acting is heavily stylised (as is the scenery), and the division of the film into sections with titles such as `The Hook' or `The Line' is reminiscent of the formal division of a stage play into acts and scenes. The film is not in black-and-white but in bright colour, and the mood, far from being heavy and brooding, is light and cheerful. Scott Joplin's music, although written slightly earlier than the period in which the film is set, fits this mood perfectly. The major actors all play their parts perfectly- Robert Shaw as the glowering, menacing Lonnegan, Robert Redford as the young, idealistic Hooker (insofar as a con-man can be said to be an idealist), and Paul Newman as the older, more experienced and laid-back Gondorff. There are also good contributions from Charles Durning as the corrupt policement Lieutenant Snyder and Robert Earl Jones as Luther.\n\nDespite the cheerful mood, the film has serious undertones in keeping with its themes of revenge and murder. I am not usually a great admirer of what are known as `heist' or `caper' movies, as I feel that too often they glamourise crime and dishonesty. `The Sting', however, is different. Hooker and Gondorff live in a world where the moral order has broken down. The police are hopelessly corrupt- Snyder, the one representative we see of the forces of law and order, is on Lonnegan's payroll. There is no chance of Hooker getting justice for his friend's murder through the normal channels; the only way in which this can be achieved is to go outside the law. Where the police are crooked, only the criminals can execute justice. The emotional satisfaction we feel at the end of the film is because a sort of moral order has finally been restored and, moreover, because this has been done without anyone getting injured except Lonnegan's wallet. An excellent film, which well deserved its Academy Award. 9/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":253115,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1973-12-25","keywords":"con,con man,illegal activity,playing golf,con artist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Sting","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2717122841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000602/","name":"Robert Redford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001727/","name":"Robert Shaw"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001351/","name":"George Roy Hill"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019166/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911486/","name":"David S.

Director Stephen Johnsons' "High Ground" is no exception. It's the little things...always the little things like the sound effects of a bird eating its prey or a lizard scratching on the bark of a tree, and even green ants munching on flora that make this film so intimate and at times feels like I'm watching a Clint Eastwood cowboy flick. The break out role for Indigenous actor Jacob Junior Nayin ggul as Gutjuk (which means Hawk) is outstanding and not to be overshadowed by legendary actors like Simon Baker, Jack Thompson, Callan Mulvey or fellow Aboriginal actor Aaron Pederson. "High Ground" is a brutal retelling of our First Nations Peoples horrific treatment at the hands of the British Colonists to their country...all in the name of the Crown. Its Australia's answer to similar action in other countries like the British colonisation of the Americas and their treatment of the Natives. It's a familiar story around the globe. None of it is pretty, except the Country itself. This is up close and personal from the perspective of both the Colonials and the local tribes and the disastrous results of these encounters. "High Ground" is set against the stunning landscape of 1930's Arnhem Land. Sacred land for Northern Territory tribes that live there to this day. Bakers' Travis and Gutjuk are out to track down warring wild tribesman and Uncle, Baywarra, played by Sean Mununggurr. Whilst his own Granfather Dharrpa (Witiyana Marika) is trying to make peace and seek justice for the deaths of his family by the Colonial Soldiers. On this journey in the outback who can you really trust? Simon Baker in his 50's is making superb movies including Breath (Netflix) This movie was first screened in an open air theatre in Western Australia with a near full capacity crowd. Made all the more remarkable because not many places in the world can host large crowds during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Cinemas around the world are in desperate need of content to fill their big screens right now and Australia is delivering the goods with first class films for the world to watch. Movies like "High Ground" make you understand why some people are uncomfortable with Australia Day (the official national day of Australia) and protest its anniversary.

But on the whole, this is an over-the-top, pretentious dud, the sort of thing that should be seen only by the paid critics who then have a professional obligation and civic duty to spare all the rest of us such an irritating waste of our time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":940,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"2003-10-17","keywords":"sex standing up,lift skirt,panties hit the floor,panties pulled down,fondling","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0538048/","name":"Krzysztof Majchrzak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272295/","name":"Adam Ferency","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322937/","name":"Krzysztof Globisz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464383/","name":"Jan Jakub Kolski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043688/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0094194/","name":"Luc Bondy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102722/","name":"Gérard Brach","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326822/","name":"Witold Gombrowicz"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">W trakcie II wojny światowej z Polski zniknęły setki tysięcy bezcennych dzieł sztuki. Zarówno niemieccy, jak i radzieccy okupanci masowo wywozili obrazy i rzeźby. Nie wszystkie udało się odzyskać. Obecnie wiele z tych polskich zbiorów rozsianych jest po całym świecie. Historyk sztuki Jerzy S. Majewski przybliża losy tych zrabowanych dóbr. Snuje opowieść o skradzionym dorobku wielu wspaniałych artystów i wyjaśnia, co się z nim dokładnie stało.</desc>

    <title lang="pl">Miasta rytm: Zrabowane dzieła sztuki</title>
    <desc lang="pl">W trakcie II wojny światowej z Polski zniknęły setki tysięcy bezcennych dzieł sztuki. Zarówno niemieccy, jak i radzieccy okupanci masowo wywozili obrazy i rzeźby. Nie wszystkie udało się odzyskać. Obecnie wiele z tych polskich zbiorów rozsianych jest po całym świecie. Historyk sztuki Jerzy S. Majewski przybliża losy tych zrabowanych dóbr. Snuje opowieść o skradzionym dorobku wielu wspaniałych artystów i wyjaśnia, co się z nim dokładnie stało.</desc>

He says the word "truth" is a word that comes down from England where all of our ancestors come, and looking at him incredulously is some of the black jury members.  Fred Gwynne supplies some of the best comedy for the film with his constant badgering of Vinny.  Everything from his suit, to his enunciation of words like "youts", to his court room impropriety to his just plain dislike of him.  Gwynne and Pesci are so opposite as people. Gwynne being a giant of a man with a southern drawl and a long, virile face while Pesci is a short man with a distinct New Yawk slur and a pudgy, baby looking face.  They are complete opposites and much of the hilarity comes from their inability to see eye to eye on many things.\n\nIt also has to said that Marisa Tomei is brilliant in this film.  There are people out there that try to demean her Oscar triumph that year because the favourite did not win like anticipated.  But her performance here is nothing short of Oscar worthy.

We've all done our share of "dumping". Whether it's the, "Lets just be friends," or the all too familiar, "It's not you, it's me," tactic, as long as you're not on the receiving end it becomes a question of, "How quickly can I get this over with, so I can move on with my life?" Equally, all of us (yes even Brad Pitt) have experienced what it feels like to "be" dumped and the complex emotions that unexpectedly follow. If you're one of the fortunate souls that have managed to escape the throws of relationship hell, you'll probably fare better with renting the newest addition to the Rambo series. For the rest of you who've at one time or another gotten your hearts ripped out of your chests and stomped into a million pieces only to turn you into unshaven, alcoholic hermits on the brink of starvation this movie is dedicated to you. \n\nTom (Joseph-Gordon-Levitt) is a wanna-be architect turned professional greeting card writer whose life is thrown for a loop when he suddenly falls for the "new girl" Summer (Zooey Deschanel, Almost Famous). As one who appeared most certainly unattainable at first glance, Tom manages to charm her into what she coins as a, "casual relationship." Eventually, Tom ends up questioning their status with one another, which manages to put strain on the relationship, causing her to request the dreaded "time apart." (500) Days of Summer chronicles the bitter sweet beginnings, the untimely endings and all of that confusing stuff that takes place during the in betweens of a relationship that just isn't meant to be.\n\n(500) Days of Summer is presented in an effective non-linear style that sets it apart from its romantic comedy predecessors, rotating back and forth between dates signified by a simple title card flashing in between scenes (2), (50), (150) and so on to represent the various days in the course of Toms roller coaster of a relationship. This seesaw method of bouncing to and fro successfully manages to force the viewer in a physically engaging shared experience of Tom's feelings, which is something every director aspires to elicit from their intended audience. \n\nThe real kudos go to Scott Neustadter and Michael Weber, whose script is practically flawless. You can't help but feel that their authenticity and attention to detail while constructing each scene through appropriately sarcastic and funny dialogue exchanges among all of the main characters involved, particularly those between Deschanel and Levitt which come across as heartbreakingly real and genuine.

Vera is one of the kindest souls one will ever see in pictures in a long, long time. Vera Drake is a woman who will go out of her way to be of use to anyone that needs her. In fact, one's initial reaction to Mrs. Drake's activities is one of complete disbelief.\n\nMike Leigh has created a film that, although not easy to sit through, is one of the finest movies that have come out of the English cinema in a long time. This director keeps getting better with every new film. The subject of the film is something that has been at the heart of the recent elections in the USA. With the new climate in this country it's easy to see that situations like the ones we see in the story, could well be the norm here in a not too distant future.\n\nThe main, and perhaps the only, reason for watching this extraordinary film is the portrayal of Vera by that wonderful actress, Imelda Staunton. Her Vera is an example a person who can't say no to anyone in need. There is a scene when Vera is first confronted by the police during a dinner at her house where we see her face as charges are hurled at her, then little by little, Ms. Staunton breaks down in what is one of the great moments in acting by any actress in living memory. One can see her eyes fill with tears because it suddenly dawns on Vera the immensity of what she has done.\n\nThe action takes place in 1950 in a London still ravaged by the effect of WWII. The film recreates the era with great details. Vera's flat is so tiny, one wonders how can four grown up people live in such cramped quarters. Even though they are poor, the Drake household is happy, as they all live together without apparently getting on each other's nerves. Both children, Ethel and Sid are well behaved; they both love their parents. Stan and Vera love one another in a subdued, but caring way. Is it possible that Vera could be the monster she is accused of being?\n\nThe film also makes a point of the contrast between the humble way in which the Drakes live and the rich houses where Vera goes to work every day. Vera's home is tiny and the others are so well appointed, it is only natural to assume that Vera will bear a resentment toward her employers, but on the contrary, she is a dignified woman who makes do with her meager wages.\n\nThere is also the irony about how Susan Wells, the daughter of one of Vera's employers, goes through the same thing that the other girls that Vera "helps", and everything is done in a civilized way. Mr. Leigh shows us in this case how things are different because Susan is able to buy a solution to her problem and deal with it safely.\n\nThe ensemble cast is marvelous. Imelda Staunton dominates the movie. We can't take our eyes away from the dowdy and plain woman we see on the screen. Phil Davis as Stan, Vera's husband, is excellent. Alex Kelly plays the mousy daughter Ethel, who never utters a word; this actress makes her real. Daniel Mays is Sid, the son who can't understand what his mother has done. Eddie Marsan as Reg, makes his character believable.\n\nThe film is a triumph for Mike Leigh.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":25036,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-01-07","keywords":"pregnancy,unwanted pregnancy,abortionist,female protagonist,panties","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Vera Drake","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1392181529","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQxODkwYjctOWVkMi00Y2UwLTk1YjQtMWRmMWRhM2YyNmZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDQxODkwYjctOWVkMi00Y2UwLTk1YjQtMWRmMWRhM2YyNmZlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001767/","name":"Imelda Staunton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000980/","name":"Jim Broadbent"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0186452/","name":"Heather Craney"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005139/","name":"Mike Leigh"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022244/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104092/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0207655/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005139/","name":"Mike Leigh"}],"duration":"PT2H5M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I felt like it was trying too hard to be too many things.  Using a mixture of various film makers styles it just didn't seem to provide anything fresh. The story telling method used too many twists to work successfully. If stylish visuals and multi layered stories are your main thing then give it a go. Otherwise you may find some of the negative comments and low scores this film has attracted to be justified.\n\nMy rating 5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21482,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2018-05-11","keywords":"bare chested male bondage,tied to a bed,revenge,written by director,wager","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi671922201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0Y2YwZDktYzc3Mi00ZjE3LWI3NmMtNjZiYmFlYTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzU0Y2YwZDktYzc3Mi00ZjE3LWI3NmMtNjZiYmFlYTBlZTE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In the dark heart of a sprawling, anonymous city, 'Terminal' follows the twisting tales of two assassins carrying out a sinister mission, a teacher battling a fatal illness, an enigmatic janitor and a curious waitress leading a dangerous double life.

During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.  \n\nThis is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).\n\nIn conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.

Director Stephen Johnsons' "High Ground" is no exception. It's the little things...always the little things like the sound effects of a bird eating its prey or a lizard scratching on the bark of a tree, and even green ants munching on flora that make this film so intimate and at times feels like I'm watching a Clint Eastwood cowboy flick. The break out role for Indigenous actor Jacob Junior Nayin ggul as Gutjuk (which means Hawk) is outstanding and not to be overshadowed by legendary actors like Simon Baker, Jack Thompson, Callan Mulvey or fellow Aboriginal actor Aaron Pederson. "High Ground" is a brutal retelling of our First Nations Peoples horrific treatment at the hands of the British Colonists to their country...all in the name of the Crown. Its Australia's answer to similar action in other countries like the British colonisation of the Americas and their treatment of the Natives. It's a familiar story around the globe. None of it is pretty, except the Country itself. This is up close and personal from the perspective of both the Colonials and the local tribes and the disastrous results of these encounters. "High Ground" is set against the stunning landscape of 1930's Arnhem Land. Sacred land for Northern Territory tribes that live there to this day. Bakers' Travis and Gutjuk are out to track down warring wild tribesman and Uncle, Baywarra, played by Sean Mununggurr. Whilst his own Granfather Dharrpa (Witiyana Marika) is trying to make peace and seek justice for the deaths of his family by the Colonial Soldiers. On this journey in the outback who can you really trust? Simon Baker in his 50's is making superb movies including Breath (Netflix) This movie was first screened in an open air theatre in Western Australia with a near full capacity crowd. Made all the more remarkable because not many places in the world can host large crowds during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Cinemas around the world are in desperate need of content to fill their big screens right now and Australia is delivering the goods with first class films for the world to watch. Movies like "High Ground" make you understand why some people are uncomfortable with Australia Day (the official national day of Australia) and protest its anniversary. Observed annually on 26 January, it marks the 1788 raising of the British flag at Sydney Cove by Arthur Phillip following days of exploration in New South Wales by the First Fleet.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-01-28","keywords":"topless woman,bare breasts,shooting,spearing,aboriginal","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3634085913","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZlZDA5MzYtOWE3ZS00M2MzLTg4YzYtMWIyMGYzYTliMTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZlZDA5MzYtOWE3ZS00M2MzLTg4YzYtMWIyMGYzYTliMTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Gutjuk teams up with ex-sniper Travis to track down the most dangerous warrior in the Territory, who is also his uncle.

Director Stephen Johnsons' "High Ground" is no exception. It's the little things...always the little things like the sound effects of a bird eating its prey or a lizard scratching on the bark of a tree, and even green ants munching on flora that make this film so intimate and at times feels like I'm watching a Clint Eastwood cowboy flick. The break out role for Indigenous actor Jacob Junior Nayin ggul as Gutjuk (which means Hawk) is outstanding and not to be overshadowed by legendary actors like Simon Baker, Jack Thompson, Callan Mulvey or fellow Aboriginal actor Aaron Pederson. "High Ground" is a brutal retelling of our First Nations Peoples horrific treatment at the hands of the British Colonists to their country...all in the name of the Crown. Its Australia's answer to similar action in other countries like the British colonisation of the Americas and their treatment of the Natives. It's a familiar story around the globe. None of it is pretty, except the Country itself. This is up close and personal from the perspective of both the Colonials and the local tribes and the disastrous results of these encounters. "High Ground" is set against the stunning landscape of 1930's Arnhem Land. Sacred land for Northern Territory tribes that live there to this day. Bakers' Travis and Gutjuk are out to track down warring wild tribesman and Uncle, Baywarra, played by Sean Mununggurr. Whilst his own Granfather Dharrpa (Witiyana Marika) is trying to make peace and seek justice for the deaths of his family by the Colonial Soldiers. On this journey in the outback who can you really trust? Simon Baker in his 50's is making superb movies including Breath (Netflix) This movie was first screened in an open air theatre in Western Australia with a near full capacity crowd. Made all the more remarkable because not many places in the world can host large crowds during the Covid-19 Pandemic. Cinemas around the world are in desperate need of content to fill their big screens right now and Australia is delivering the goods with first class films for the world to watch. Movies like "High Ground" make you understand why some people are uncomfortable with Australia Day (the official national day of Australia) and protest its anniversary. Observed annually on 26 January, it marks the 1788 raising of the British flag at Sydney Cove by Arthur Phillip following days of exploration in New South Wales by the First Fleet.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1675,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-01-28","keywords":"topless woman,bare breasts,shooting,spearing,aboriginal","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3634085913","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZlZDA5MzYtOWE3ZS00M2MzLTg4YzYtMWIyMGYzYTliMTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmZlZDA5MzYtOWE3ZS00M2MzLTg4YzYtMWIyMGYzYTliMTNmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Gutjuk teams up with ex-sniper Travis to track down the most dangerous warrior in the Territory, who is also his uncle.

Very little outside 'the norm' is required for teenagers to ostracize one of their own. Sometimes it's a haircut or a brand of shoes, or even some other minor detail that sets them apart. But when it's a mental illness, the tribe can be merciless. Director Thor Freudenthal (DIARY OF A WIMPY KID, 2010) takes on Julia Walton's 2017 novel, with a screenplay from Nick Naveda. The film features two rising young stars and addresses some of the challenges brought on by the uncertainties associated with a mental illness.\n\nCharlie Plummer (so terrific in LEAN ON PETE, 2018) stars as Adam, a high school senior who has dealt with the challenges of undiagnosed mental health issues since he was quite young. His father abandoned the family years ago, and Adam's devoted mother (Molly Parker, "House of Cards") is not only patient and loving, but also committed to researching any possible treatment that would lead Adam to a better life. On the other hand, Adam and his mother's new live-in lover Paul (Walton Goggins) don't exactly see eye-to-eye on things, leading to more anxiety for Adam.\n\nIn an interesting and unique approach, director Freudenthal allows us to not only hear the voices Adam hears, but also see the hallucinations and visions he sees - three of whom are Rebecca (AnnaSophia Robb, THE WAY WAY BACK), a sweet, hippie-ish optimist; The Bodyguard (Lobo Sebastian), a cigar-chomping, bat swinging he-man; and Joaquin (Devon Bostick), an inappropriately horny 'best friend from a 90's move." On top of that, there is a black mist that periodically manifests, enveloping Adam and bringing on crippling fear and isolation. After a years-long stream of drug therapy, Adam is pronounced "treatment resistant" and diagnosed as schizophrenic. Adam's only mind-calming escape is when he's cooking. He knows his way around the kitchen and his goal is to attend Culinary School after graduation.\n\nOne day, Adam has a psychotic break during Chemistry class. He gets expelled, which jeopardizes his Culinary School dream. His mother gets him admitted to a Catholic School run by Sister Catherine (Beth Grant) at the same time he is accepted into an experimental drug trial. He's allowed to stay in school as long as he takes his meds and maintains his grades. It's here where he meets the dynamic Maya (Taylor Russell (WAVES, 2019). Maya is smart and ambitious and proud, and the two quickly form a bond - an interesting bond between two smart high school kids carrying their own burdens and holding their own secrets.\n\nSister Catherine is balancing the specific needs of Adam with her responsibility to the school, and then there is also prom and graduation to deal with. With the new drug, the voices and visions disappear, but Adam has some issues with the side effects. A desperate plea for help from Father Patrick (Andy Garcia), the school priest, provides a boost as Adam tells him, "It's nice to be listened to and not just observed." That line provides significant insight into what it's like to have this affliction, and that's really where the movie excels ... putting us in the shoes of a schizophrenic and allowing us to experience the good and bad moments. What can Adam trust? His eyes? His ears? His mind?\n\nAdam and Maya are both trying to figure out who they are, at the same time learning what it really means to love someone. Adam refers to his illness as his "burgeoning insanity", and in fact, schizophrenia does have a history of accelerating over time once it strikes a young person. The movie succeeds in taking away some of the mystique of mental illness, by making it approachable and something we want to better understand.

It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.\n\nIt's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).\n\nThe Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.\n\nIn a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.\n\nBridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice ("Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.\n\nTwo little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.\n\nAside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":301757,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"lawyer,negotiation,cold war,spy,berlin wall","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Standing Man" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi303870745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4131020/","name":"Matt Charman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"duration":"PT2H22M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It's the kind of material that would attract Spielberg, especially with the hero of the story, Jim Donovan (Tom Hanks), who comes into a situation he shouldn't be involved with but not only can pull off talking and reasoning with people and finding the better side of a situation or person's nature. What's surprising in a way is the involvement of the Coen brothers with the script.\n\nIt's hard to say if Matt Charman was the primary writer (someone I'm not familiar with, not least on the level of his co-writers) and if the brothers came in on a polish. But watching the movie, it does make more sense - certainly more than Unbroken, which barely has their touch - since it carries a lot of dry wit in the exchanges between characters, in particular the opposing attitudes of people in this 'period' setting. Hanks' Donovan is a straight-shooting guy who believes in the constitution of the United States and wants to do right, legally speaking, by his client Rudolf (Mark Rylance in a fine, subtle supporting role), and doesn't really care per-say what he's done or didn't do. This doesn't fly well in a society that is overrun with Red-Scare fever and end up doing the worst of things when in total fear of things (i.e. the A-bomb, which gets a kind of cameo in the film in a way that Spielberg I'm sure has a personal connection with, being a child of the 50's, but I digress).\n\nThe Coens I think brought a sense of realism to things, but also stylization; the way characters talk at times there's a lot of things where people try to figure the other person out, which is fascinating to watch. When Donovan arrives at the first part of the mission he's given in the second part of the film, to do this exchange of the Russian for an American pilot caught by the enemy, he goes to the Russians and doesn't talk to the lawyer (who he thought to talk to) but some other official. Spielberg covers this expertly, going in on Hanks and the other actor at just the right moments to emphasize things getting tenser - another young American, a student caught up in the mix of things (it IS East Berlin, after all) - but the script dictates a lot of the momentum here. And at the same time the Coens aren't necessarily making it 'Coens-y', in a manner of speaking; they serve their filmmaker extremely well, giving a light air to a good number of scenes in a way that keeps the tension and suspense in a good balance.\n\nIn a way it's interesting to get this so soon after The Martian, also in theaters: two films about perilous situations and men caught in a struggle to survive, and two stories that benefit from some levity. Between the two though, Bridge of Spies is the more serious affair, and certainly Spielberg has a lot thematically on his plate. The story takes place during the Cold War time, but it's really a war-war (so to speak, sorry, couldn't find another way to put it), only with terse words and missions via the CIA instead of men on a battlefield. At the same time I feel like the message can, and probably will, resonate today; Spielberg knows that we're in times where it can be dubious whether people are put on trial and given proper legal counsel if they're suspected 'others' or combatants, and if they get the counsel who knows how the trial will go.\n\nBridge of Spies may have Hanks being, shall we say, Jimmy Stewart-like (I know other critics will or have), and is the guy the audience likes - his endearing characteristic in the second half, of all things, is a cold. But it's because Spielberg embraces this, as does Hanks in playing him, that he's a man who will stop at nothing to get done what needs to be done for a man's freedom and security (or how he sees it, so down the line, despite whatever happens in prison walls with glaring lights and big questions about this or that for information). Perhaps with a tougher kind of actor this wouldn't work, like I could never picture, say, Bruce Willis in this role. Hanks comes in and is unequivocal in his earnest desire for justice ("Everyone deserves a defense, every life matters" echoes another Spielberg motto in Schindler's List), and it's refreshing in a way to see this in a movie right now.\n\nTwo little issues: the film's ending is a little long, with a coda that feels like it stretches just a little longer than it should, albeit for a visual callback that does add a bittersweet tinge that is welcome and interesting; and the lack of a John Williams score (the first for Spielberg in 30 years) is startling. Thomas Newman isn't bad at his work, but it's unremarkable, and doesn't give certain scenes that do need a little extra punch or kick that 'Spielberg' type of music. It's hard to describe it, but I feel it when I do, especially during the climax.\n\nAside from those small points, this is near-classic work by this director, with a star in top form who is wholly convincing. It's also a wholesome movie in that old-time Hollywood sense, but not in a way that should date it any time soon; it takes a stand for what should be held accountable for those accused, and that, really, having a good insurance policy is maybe the only policy that's logical.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":301757,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2015-10-16","keywords":"lawyer,negotiation,cold war,spy,berlin wall","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":""Standing Man" Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi303870745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg5MDEyMjcwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUzODE4NjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the latest trailer for Bridge of Spies with Tom Hanks.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000158/","name":"Tom Hanks","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0753314/","name":"Mark Rylance","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000257/","name":"Alan Alda"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0336601/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4131020/","name":"Matt Charman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"],"duration":"PT2H22M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

With different filmmakers this could have been an interesting production.\n\nThe lack of an ending was also a great disappointment.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4975,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2021-04-23","keywords":"surrogate,title spoken in dialogue,coffee shop,teddy bear,doctor's visit","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi444842009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ5MGNiYzMtN2ExZS00NTVlLThiMGQtMzUyYzE0NjlkZDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ5MGNiYzMtN2ExZS00NTVlLThiMGQtMzUyYzE0NjlkZDU5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"When young loner Anna is hired as the gestational surrogate for Matt, a single man in his 40s who wants a child, the two strangers come to realize this unexpected relationship will quickly challenge their perceptions of connection, boundaries and the particulars of love.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8773928/","name":"Patti Harrison","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1159180/","name":"Ed Helms","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001034/","name":"Rosalind Chao"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2859868/","name":"Nikole Beckwith"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0491312/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0588086/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0386393/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2859868/","name":"Nikole Beckwith"],"duration":"PT1H30M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If you're going to re-make "The Magnificent 7" let's do it magnificently. Where was that great music? Where is the superlative cast that include Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Vladimir Sokoloff? You might argue that Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt are on a level with Brynner and McQueen, but I wouldn't. Pratt certainly has potential, but he doesn't yet have McQueen's star power. The rest are pale imitations, except perhaps for an unbelievably fat Vincent D'Onofrio who is certainly entertaining.\n\nThis is a modern re-telling. You might call it the Diversity 7. The producers threw in just about every minority you can think of – Mexican, Asian, Black, Woman. The only thing missing was a "little" person .\n\nPersonally I liked the idea of the woman, played very well by Haley Bennett who has been with Washington before ("The Equalizer").\n\nAn action film like this works only when the villain is villainous. Eli Wallach was terrific. Peter Sarsgaard wouldn't scare a fly.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I enjoyed it. It's OK, but it's not magnificent.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":202265,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Western"],"datePublished":"2016-09-23","keywords":"showdown,remake,industrialist,bounty hunter,gunfighter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3980375833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTYyNTAyMTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA5NjE3NDkx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTYyNTAyMTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA5NjE3NDkx._V1_.jpg","description":"With the town of Rose Creek under the deadly control of industrialist Bartholomew Bogue, the desperate townspeople employ protection from seven outlaws, bounty hunters, gamblers and hired guns.

If you're going to re-make "The Magnificent 7" let's do it magnificently. Where was that great music? Where is the superlative cast that include Yul Brynner, Eli Wallach, Steve McQueen, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, and Vladimir Sokoloff? You might argue that Denzel Washington and Chris Pratt are on a level with Brynner and McQueen, but I wouldn't. Pratt certainly has potential, but he doesn't yet have McQueen's star power. The rest are pale imitations, except perhaps for an unbelievably fat Vincent D'Onofrio who is certainly entertaining.\n\nThis is a modern re-telling. You might call it the Diversity 7. The producers threw in just about every minority you can think of – Mexican, Asian, Black, Woman. The only thing missing was a "little" person .\n\nPersonally I liked the idea of the woman, played very well by Haley Bennett who has been with Washington before ("The Equalizer").\n\nAn action film like this works only when the villain is villainous. Eli Wallach was terrific. Peter Sarsgaard wouldn't scare a fly.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I enjoyed it. It's OK, but it's not magnificent.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":202265,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Western"],"datePublished":"2016-09-23","keywords":"showdown,remake,industrialist,bounty hunter,gunfighter","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3980375833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTYyNTAyMTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA5NjE3NDkx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTExOTYyNTAyMTheQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA5NjE3NDkx._V1_.jpg","description":"With the town of Rose Creek under the deadly control of industrialist Bartholomew Bogue, the desperate townspeople employ protection from seven outlaws, bounty hunters, gamblers and hired guns.

A Top 20 Greatest Film","reviewBody":"Chinatown sits securely at the pinnacle of the Neo Noir genre.

Very little outside 'the norm' is required for teenagers to ostracize one of their own. Sometimes it's a haircut or a brand of shoes, or even some other minor detail that sets them apart. But when it's a mental illness, the tribe can be merciless. Director Thor Freudenthal (DIARY OF A WIMPY KID, 2010) takes on Julia Walton's 2017 novel, with a screenplay from Nick Naveda. The film features two rising young stars and addresses some of the challenges brought on by the uncertainties associated with a mental illness.\n\nCharlie Plummer (so terrific in LEAN ON PETE, 2018) stars as Adam, a high school senior who has dealt with the challenges of undiagnosed mental health issues since he was quite young. His father abandoned the family years ago, and Adam's devoted mother (Molly Parker, "House of Cards") is not only patient and loving, but also committed to researching any possible treatment that would lead Adam to a better life. On the other hand, Adam and his mother's new live-in lover Paul (Walton Goggins) don't exactly see eye-to-eye on things, leading to more anxiety for Adam.\n\nIn an interesting and unique approach, director Freudenthal allows us to not only hear the voices Adam hears, but also see the hallucinations and visions he sees - three of whom are Rebecca (AnnaSophia Robb, THE WAY WAY BACK), a sweet, hippie-ish optimist; The Bodyguard (Lobo Sebastian), a cigar-chomping, bat swinging he-man; and Joaquin (Devon Bostick), an inappropriately horny 'best friend from a 90's move." On top of that, there is a black mist that periodically manifests, enveloping Adam and bringing on crippling fear and isolation. After a years-long stream of drug therapy, Adam is pronounced "treatment resistant" and diagnosed as schizophrenic. Adam's only mind-calming escape is when he's cooking. He knows his way around the kitchen and his goal is to attend Culinary School after graduation.\n\nOne day, Adam has a psychotic break during Chemistry class. He gets expelled, which jeopardizes his Culinary School dream. His mother gets him admitted to a Catholic School run by Sister Catherine (Beth Grant) at the same time he is accepted into an experimental drug trial. He's allowed to stay in school as long as he takes his meds and maintains his grades. It's here where he meets the dynamic Maya (Taylor Russell (WAVES, 2019). Maya is smart and ambitious and proud, and the two quickly form a bond - an interesting bond between two smart high school kids carrying their own burdens and holding their own secrets.\n\nSister Catherine is balancing the specific needs of Adam with her responsibility to the school, and then there is also prom and graduation to deal with. With the new drug, the voices and visions disappear, but Adam has some issues with the side effects. A desperate plea for help from Father Patrick (Andy Garcia), the school priest, provides a boost as Adam tells him, "It's nice to be listened to and not just observed." That line provides significant insight into what it's like to have this affliction, and that's really where the movie excels ... putting us in the shoes of a schizophrenic and allowing us to experience the good and bad moments. What can Adam trust? His eyes? His ears? His mind?\n\nAdam and Maya are both trying to figure out who they are, at the same time learning what it really means to love someone. Adam refers to his illness as his "burgeoning insanity", and in fact, schizophrenia does have a history of accelerating over time once it strikes a young person. The movie succeeds in taking away some of the mystique of mental illness, by making it approachable and something we want to better understand. There is a visual reference to Van Gogh's "Starry Night" that might be a bit too "nail on the head", but Freudenthal's movie is profound and features two very talented young actors. The humanity beneath the surface of those society would rather pretend don't exist is effectively compared to those stricken with cancer ... those we would do anything for.

I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.\n\nJojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's "kind", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.\n\nThe smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself. Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.\n\nThe cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a naïve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character. There were even a few moments where he becomes a bit more antagonistic towards Jojo as he begins doubting the faith in his idol.\n\nJojo Rabbit may be a controversial pick if it does get nominated for awards consideration (after I saw it on the last day of TIFF, it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award), but I feel like it is a movie needed for today's political issues.

I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.\n\nJojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's "kind", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.\n\nThe smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself. Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.\n\nThe cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a naïve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character. There were even a few moments where he becomes a bit more antagonistic towards Jojo as he begins doubting the faith in his idol.\n\nJojo Rabbit may be a controversial pick if it does get nominated for awards consideration (after I saw it on the last day of TIFF, it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award), but I feel like it is a movie needed for today's political issues. Taika Waititi uses the story of a boy's misguided fantasy and faith to show how easy it is for society to be manipulated into hating minorities, religions and/or groups of people especially when fake news and social media is present. But by the end of the day he shows that compassion and love are still worth embracing in a cruel world so as long as we are able to confront to cruelty in ourselves first.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350018,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2019-10-24","keywords":"nazi germany,world war two,satire,mother son relationship,black comedy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2663366425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIzMWMzMTgtZjNmOC00ZTMyLWJkZDItZWUxNGQ0OWNhMzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIzMWMzMTgtZjNmOC00ZTMyLWJkZDItZWUxNGQ0OWNhMzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer director Taika Waititi (THOR: RAGNAROK, HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE), brings his signature style of humor and pathos to his latest film, JOJO RABBIT, a World War II satire that follows a lonely German boy (Roman Griffin Davis as JoJo) whose world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic.

I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.\n\nJojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's "kind", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.\n\nThe smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself. Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.\n\nThe cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a naïve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character. There were even a few moments where he becomes a bit more antagonistic towards Jojo as he begins doubting the faith in his idol.\n\nJojo Rabbit may be a controversial pick if it does get nominated for awards consideration (after I saw it on the last day of TIFF, it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award), but I feel like it is a movie needed for today's political issues. Taika Waititi uses the story of a boy's misguided fantasy and faith to show how easy it is for society to be manipulated into hating minorities, religions and/or groups of people especially when fake news and social media is present. But by the end of the day he shows that compassion and love are still worth embracing in a cruel world so as long as we are able to confront to cruelty in ourselves first.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350018,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2019-10-24","keywords":"nazi germany,world war two,satire,mother son relationship,black comedy","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2663366425","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIzMWMzMTgtZjNmOC00ZTMyLWJkZDItZWUxNGQ0OWNhMzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIzMWMzMTgtZjNmOC00ZTMyLWJkZDItZWUxNGQ0OWNhMzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer director Taika Waititi (THOR: RAGNAROK, HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE), brings his signature style of humor and pathos to his latest film, JOJO RABBIT, a World War II satire that follows a lonely German boy (Roman Griffin Davis as JoJo) whose world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic.

I was pleasantly surprised on how emotional and thought provoking he made this film while still being very funny without going too far.\n\nJojo is a 10-year old boy who dreams of fighting for his country and making his hero proud. And that hero just so happens to be Adolf Hitler during the final year of WW2. Jojo's blind fanaticism is so extreme he imagines Adolf as his best friend to give him advice, which to no surprise, is not that helpful. After an accident at the Hitler Youth camp, Jojo has to stay with his mother only to discover she is hiding Elsa, a teenage girl who is the very thing his Nazis beliefs have told him to fear and hate: a Jew. As Jojo tries to learn about Elsa's "kind", he begins to sees Elsa as the thoughtful yet scared person she really is and not the monster his beliefs have told her to be.\n\nThe smartest thing I can say is Waitia knows when to make a joke about Nazi's beliefs and ideals but then let the bleakness of WW2 set in to embrace the deeper themes and emotions. Within the first act, Jojo sees his world through rose-tinted glasses as he gleefully gives the Nazi salute to his fellow neighbours on a bright sunny day. All of the Nazi characters are heightened and exaggerated for comic relief from Sam Rockwell's Captain Klenzendorf being a tired and annoyed German soldier, Rebel Wilson as the ignorant Fraulein Rahm to Stephen Merchant as the Gestapo agent Deertz. Waititi takes pleasure in making Nazis the but of the joke from showing them being over-committed to saluting each other for just a simple introduction to their obliviousness of believing any stupid fake news they are told came from Hilter himself. Once Jojo settles with Elsa sharing his house, his world begins show its true ugliness as Germany becomes more desperate to hold their ground against the Allied forces. At that point Waititi slows down on the comedy and allows moments of shock and drama to settle in to remind the audience what is the horrible cost of ignorance and blind faith. Cinematographer Mihai Malaimare Jr. switches the color scheme from bright and saturated to cold and grey as the seasons pass to reflect the change in Jojo's state of mind. The parallels to the modern day become very clear without getting too blunt.\n\nThe cast plays each of their roles perfectly. Roman Griffin Davis carries the story as a naïve but yet innocence Jojo. Davis is perfectly cast with perfect comedic timing while still being able to sell the emotional beats that are needed. And he has great comedic and emotional chemistry with Thomasin McKenzie as Elsa. McKenzie displays the hardship her character has gone throughout her life and yet still making her fun and sharp-witted when she points out shallowness of Jojo's ideals. Also who is worth mentioning is Scarlett Johansson as Jojo's mother Rosie. Probably the best performance of Johansson I have seen so far, she brings a huge feeling of joy and optimism that is needed to help Jojo's growth as a character. Out of all of the adults that are blind to the horrors the Axis power is inflicting upon the world, Rosie is the only one that is able to see through it and confront it. As for the big question of Waititi himself playing a young boy's interpretation of Adolf Hitler, he handles it very well. His comedic performance is there to show the absurdity of Jojo's brainwashing from the Nazis's teaching. And it helps that he never to tries to humanize the portrayal of his character. There were even a few moments where he becomes a bit more antagonistic towards Jojo as he begins doubting the faith in his idol.\n\nJojo Rabbit may be a controversial pick if it does get nominated for awards consideration (after I saw it on the last day of TIFF, it surprisingly won the People's Choice Award), but I feel like it is a movie needed for today's political issues. Taika Waititi uses the story of a boy's misguided fantasy and faith to show how easy it is for society to be manipulated into hating minorities, religions and/or groups of people especially when fake news and social media is present. But by the end of the day he shows that compassion and love are still worth embracing in a cruel world so as long as we are able to confront to cruelty in ourselves first.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":350018,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2019-10-24","keywords":"nazi germany,world war two,satire,mother son relationship,black comedy","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2663366425","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIzMWMzMTgtZjNmOC00ZTMyLWJkZDItZWUxNGQ0OWNhMzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGIzMWMzMTgtZjNmOC00ZTMyLWJkZDItZWUxNGQ0OWNhMzFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Writer director Taika Waititi (THOR: RAGNAROK, HUNT FOR THE WILDERPEOPLE), brings his signature style of humor and pathos to his latest film, JOJO RABBIT, a World War II satire that follows a lonely German boy (Roman Griffin Davis as JoJo) whose world view is turned upside down when he discovers his single mother (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a young Jewish girl (Thomasin McKenzie) in their attic.

They write things, and that writing changes society. In his film of the same name, director Roland Emmerich seems to be suggesting that this idea is not exactly new, and that the plays and poems attributed to William Shakespeare were essentially motivated by the same desire. He takes the age-old mystery of "Who really wrote Shakespeare's plays?" and turns it into a political thriller.\n\nIf it's difficult for you to imagine a historical costume drama done by the director of "Universal Soldier," "Stargate," "Independence Day," "Godzilla," "The Day After Tomorrow" and "2012," you are not alone. :-) I suspected that the screenplay (by John Orloff) came first, and that Emmerich discovered it and became enamored of it, and a quick trip to the IMDb verifies that this intuition was correct. It also informs me that Emmerich, taking advantage of the money he made on the previous films, paid for this whole movie out of his own pocket, so that he could have full control of the film, without interference from any studio. It shows.\n\nIt's not a bad movie at all. And this is something I never thought I'd find myself saying about a Roland Emmerich movie. The cast is simply to die for: Vanessa Redgrave as Queen Elizabeth the elder; her daughter Joely Richardson as Elizabeth the younger; Rafe Spall as Shakespeare (a talentless clod of an actor); Sebastian Arnesto as Ben Johnson (a talented playwright, but not even in the same galaxy of greatness as the author of Shakespeare's plays); David Thewlis as William Cecil; Edward Hogg as Robert Cecil; Derek Jacobi doing the prologue; Jaime Campbell Bower (from "Camelot") as the younger Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford; and Rhys Ifans as the older Edward de Vere, and the real author of Shakespeare's work.\n\nAs presented, the plot is not at all a scholarly argument for the Earl of Oxford's authorship of these plays. It is instead a clever reimagining of historical events (some treated as loosely as Shakespeare himself treated actual history) to turn the answer to the mystery that scholars argue about into a taut political thriller. In Orloff's/Emmerich's vision, Edward de Vere wrote the plays and published them under someone else's name for no less a reason that to foment revolution, change the course of history, and determine the next king of England.\n\nAnd damnit, that reimagining kinda worked for me. The sets and costumes are pitch perfect, the performances are good, and the potential is there for a good time to be had by all. Like anything related to Shakespeare, the more you know about him and his work, the better this film will be for you. There are so many asides and in-jokes that I cannot begin to go into them. Orloff really did his research. Except for the part about Edward de Vere having died before at least 10 of Shakespeare's plays were written, that is. But that's just a nitpick, and should not stand in the way of writing a good drama. Those kinds of historical nitpicks did not deter Shakespeare, and they don't deter Orloff and Emmerich.

Best Movie of All Time","reviewBody":"Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.\n\nTelling the quasi-true story of one man's conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.\n\nAlthough its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It's understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it's a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it's duplistic and hypocritical for the film's haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nOn this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert's history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland's independence.\n\nWithout trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It's beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.\n\nJames Horner's score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.\n\nThere isn't one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson's best acting roles, and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.\n\nThis is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later, another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart, but while Gladiator is a very good movie, it lacks in the emotional depth, power, and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.\n\nThe final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film.

Best Movie of All Time","reviewBody":"Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.\n\nTelling the quasi-true story of one man's conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.\n\nAlthough its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It's understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it's a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it's duplistic and hypocritical for the film's haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nOn this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert's history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland's independence.\n\nWithout trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It's beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.\n\nJames Horner's score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.\n\nThere isn't one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson's best acting roles, and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.\n\nThis is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later, another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart, but while Gladiator is a very good movie, it lacks in the emotional depth, power, and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.\n\nThe final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film. As a first time viewer, you really have no idea where the story is going to go (even as a repeat viewer it still holds weight). To this day, there is still nothing like it. Just when you think it's over or you know how it will end, it just continues to twist and turn, and then it closes with what is probably the best ending of any movie in history.\n\nIn addition to all of this, the body of Braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes, incredible editing, and great dialogue rooted in inspiration, political strategy, philosophy, and stunning human experience of love, desire, passion, suffering, and identity.\n\nWhen you look at the top rated movies on IMDB, it is laughable that comic book movies and good popcorn-fun movies are actually rated above this.

It's hard to buy them when most of the main crew are gypsies or half.\n\nThe director also makes the whole film in the Bucharest accent, but the action takes place in Piatra Neamt! :) That is a rookie mistake.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":217,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1,"genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-10-12","keywords":"neo noir","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Unidentified (2020) - International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3824140313","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YwYmFkMjQtODFmMi00MjZiLTk4ZGUtNWVkYTUyMjBhYTc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2YwYmFkMjQtODFmMi00MjZiLTk4ZGUtNWVkYTUyMjBhYTc0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6030704/","name":"Bogdan Farcas","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4568761/","name":"Dragos Dumitru","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0613555/","name":"Vasile Muraru"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3054794/","name":"Bogdan George Apetri"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0110093/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001222/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0056024/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3054794/","name":"Bogdan George Apetri","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2462431/","name":"Iulian Postelnicu"],"duration":"PT2H3M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Lionel's symptoms of Tourette's syndrome, repetitive verbalizations of a rhyming nature, were accepted equanimously by everyone he encountered. No one displayed annoyance, made fun of him, or called him insulting names to cast aspersions about his intelligence. His repetitive touching of people on the shoulder as he faced them ought to have caused women to back away and men to knock his block off. They did neither. It was as if these 1950s characters had been taught the acceptance of people with disabilities that was not really commonplace until the 21st century. This is the biggest mystery in the movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52898,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-11-01","keywords":"neo noir,1950s,jazz music,based on novel,detective","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi800112409","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ2YjJlYWItNjQxMi00ZWNjLTgxNjAtMzc4NTRmZjI3NTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ2YjJlYWItNjQxMi00ZWNjLTgxNjAtMzc4NTRmZjI3NTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set against the backdrop of 1950s New York, 'Motherless Brooklyn' follows Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton), a private detective living with Tourette Syndrome, as he ventures to solve the murder of his mentor and only friend, Frank Minna (Bruce Willis).

In a mystery that carries him from gin-soaked jazz clubs in Harlem to the hard-edged slums of Brooklyn and, finally, into the gilded halls of New York's power brokers, Lionel contends with thugs, corruption and the most dangerous man in the city to honor his friend and save the woman who might be his own salvation."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1813221/","name":"Gugu Mbatha-Raw"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113781/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113140/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504672/","name":"Jonathan Lethem"}],"duration":"PT2H24M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Lionel's symptoms of Tourette's syndrome, repetitive verbalizations of a rhyming nature, were accepted equanimously by everyone he encountered. No one displayed annoyance, made fun of him, or called him insulting names to cast aspersions about his intelligence. His repetitive touching of people on the shoulder as he faced them ought to have caused women to back away and men to knock his block off. They did neither. It was as if these 1950s characters had been taught the acceptance of people with disabilities that was not really commonplace until the 21st century. This is the biggest mystery in the movie.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52898,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2019-11-01","keywords":"neo noir,1950s,jazz music,based on novel,detective","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi800112409","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ2YjJlYWItNjQxMi00ZWNjLTgxNjAtMzc4NTRmZjI3NTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMWQ2YjJlYWItNjQxMi00ZWNjLTgxNjAtMzc4NTRmZjI3NTAyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Set against the backdrop of 1950s New York, 'Motherless Brooklyn' follows Lionel Essrog (Edward Norton), a private detective living with Tourette Syndrome, as he ventures to solve the murder of his mentor and only friend, Frank Minna (Bruce Willis).

In a mystery that carries him from gin-soaked jazz clubs in Harlem to the hard-edged slums of Brooklyn and, finally, into the gilded halls of New York's power brokers, Lionel contends with thugs, corruption and the most dangerous man in the city to honor his friend and save the woman who might be his own salvation.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1813221/","name":"Gugu Mbatha-Raw","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000285/","name":"Alec Baldwin"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113781/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0113140/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001570/","name":"Edward Norton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0504672/","name":"Jonathan Lethem"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Best Movie of All Time","reviewBody":"Braveheart is the best movie ever made in history, an absolute sculpted work of art that depicts every emotion of human existence, from suffering, to courage to love, in front of the background of political astuteness and socio-hierarchal analysis.\n\nTelling the quasi-true story of one man's conviction and courage to exact vengeance for the killing of his first wife and father at the hands of the ruthless King Edward the II of England, who in turn inspires his small province of Scotland to rebel and go to war in a real fight for freedom and independence, Braveheart is a stunning depiction of the capacity of the human spirit to overcome the odds, defy tyranny, and achieve justice, respect, and dignity against oppression.\n\nAlthough its retractors and critics will dwell and harp on the historical accuracy of some of the movie, particularly what part Robert the Bruce played in real life, there is no denying the true power and emotional influence of this movie. It's understandable, particularly for Europeans, how this could be problematic due to their upbringing in studying history, but the movie is not really about being historically perfect; it's a work of art about things much deeper. A documentary it is not, and it's duplistic and hypocritical for the film's haters to dwell on this minor detail, but perhaps allow historical rewriting to slide and give it a free pass in something like Tarantino's Inglourious Basterds or Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nOn this topic, one of the dozens of best parts in the movie is when Robert the Bruce plays an important role in one of the battles, and eventually the movie does come around and get Robert's history back on track with more accuracy as to his part and character in the battle for Scotland's independence.\n\nWithout trying to get the history perfect, this movie is simply flawless. It's beyond flawless, really. A flawless movie can just be a technical masterpiece with very little power, but the raw power and emotion coming off the screen in practically every single scene in Braveheart is like an inferno.\n\nJames Horner's score is one of the greatest scores ever for any movie, and it successfully enhances the drama and emotion of each scene, without coming across as manipulative. It fits perfectly into every single scene it is used.\n\nThere isn't one acting role that is not well-done. This is one of Gibson's best acting roles, and the guy who plays Edward II gives an outstanding performance.\n\nThis is the greatest epic movie ever created in the history of Hollywood. A few years later, another great modern epic Gladiator came out and drew rightful comparisons to Braveheart, but while Gladiator is a very good movie, it lacks in the emotional depth, power, and ultimate inspiration behind the experience of watching Braveheart.\n\nThe final Act of Braveheart is one of the most powerful ever put on film. As a first time viewer, you really have no idea where the story is going to go (even as a repeat viewer it still holds weight). To this day, there is still nothing like it. Just when you think it's over or you know how it will end, it just continues to twist and turn, and then it closes with what is probably the best ending of any movie in history.\n\nIn addition to all of this, the body of Braveheart is loaded with outstanding battle scenes, incredible editing, and great dialogue rooted in inspiration, political strategy, philosophy, and stunning human experience of love, desire, passion, suffering, and identity.\n\nWhen you look at the top rated movies on IMDB, it is laughable that comic book movies and good popcorn-fun movies are actually rated above this. This is without a doubt, hands down, one of the top 25 movies ever made, and in my opinion, it is the #1 best movie of all-time.\n\nThis movie is a masterpiece.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":998140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1995-05-24","keywords":"scotland,revolt,legend,secret marriage,historically inaccurate","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2874063641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIyZmUwMjgtMjU4OC00MDgxLWIxZWEtODM4NjcwZTJjYTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIyZmUwMjgtMjU4OC00MDgxLWIxZWEtODM4NjcwZTJjYTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000521/","name":"Sophie Marceau"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001526/","name":"Patrick McGoohan"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000700/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042559/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078539/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908824/","name":"Randall Wallace"}],"duration":"PT2H58M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

This is without a doubt, hands down, one of the top 25 movies ever made, and in my opinion, it is the #1 best movie of all-time.\n\nThis movie is a masterpiece.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":998140,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Biography","Drama","History"],"datePublished":"1995-05-24","keywords":"scotland,revolt,legend,secret marriage,historically inaccurate","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2874063641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIyZmUwMjgtMjU4OC00MDgxLWIxZWEtODM4NjcwZTJjYTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmIyZmUwMjgtMjU4OC00MDgxLWIxZWEtODM4NjcwZTJjYTVkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000521/","name":"Sophie Marceau","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001526/","name":"Patrick McGoohan"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000154/","name":"Mel Gibson"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000700/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042559/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078539/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0908824/","name":"Randall Wallace"],"duration":"PT2H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Harry Caul (Hackman) is at the top of his business, but he's disturbed.  Highly paranoiac, he is troubled by bad things that happened to some innocent people as a result of a prior surveillance job.

It is very different to the traditional zombie movie, and very different to the book. But you know what, who cares - it's not a traditional zombie movie, or the book - it's different. So suck it it up whiners and enjoy this for what it is! (And I'm a huge fan of all Max Brooks zombie books.)

It's an unusual choice to end a movie with the smallest set piece, but it worked well for me as it was in line with Gerry's quest and the (stated in the movie) fact that the answer is often so small it gets overlooked. The gravity of the decisions Gerry has to make here are greater than any previously in the movie (where mostly he just has to run like hell!) and it's that that makes this such a powerful set piece to end the movie. I learnt several things from this movie 1) to let go of my preconceptions about what a zombie film should be, 2) that a low rating doesn't mean its for kids - I have two sons and despite the lack of gore I certainly wouldn't let then see this. Its very intense and that (not the gore) is what would scare them. 3) to go with the flow - I did here and was swept along for a rapid fire 2 hour thrill ride that was a hell of a lot of fun.

Many of the reviews here are from those who only watched the pilot, which I admit showed a rather surface-level power clash of the two main characters. But as the show has gone on (I just finished S1 E6), it has gotten increasingly interesting and much smoother to watch. I mainly started watching because of Matt Cuzchry, and he holds down the cast with a strong performance every episode. I am fascinated with their exploration of corruption in hospitals (although I think it is exaggerated at times, but what drama isn't?!), and they do weave that theme into every episode. \n\nGood overall mix of medical drama, a romance, and individual character stories that have gotten more complex and real.

It might be the best parody-music biopic ever made, with amazing talent, excellent music and great, funny lines. Rewatch-ability is high. There are so many jokes in there and so much good music and acting, which make me wonder how come this film was not more popular back then. John C Reily is a multitalented actor and a great comedian overall and carries this film right from the start.

I attended the premiere of CARS at LMS on Friday, May 26. True to Disney form, the premiere itself was spectacular. Four giant screens, live entertainment,lots of fireworks, great inclusion of military personnel, and as good of a red carpet as you can do with chain link fenced areas... This movie rates right in the middle of Pixar releases for me. I place it above Monsters Inc, A Bug's Life and Toy Story 2, but not as good as the "original", the best ever, Toy Story, and The Incredibles. Everything just looks so real in this movie. The dust stirred up when Lightning drives off, the scenery around Route 66 (well, maybe not those mountains that look like the fins of old cars). Even the shine on the clean cars looks so real. As an adult, I enjoyed the story line. I can't tell you how the kids would like it, as by the time the movie finally started, my kids were asleep. As always, don't leave your seat until all of the credits roll. Sometimes they are some of the funniest clips in the movie! You'll love them this time, as they tie back to prior Pixar movies, in a car sort of way. This is definitely a movie we'll add to the DVD collection. I really hope this movie does well since it's the first release since Disney bought Pixar. Don't go in looking for the action or adult humor of The Incredibles. If you do you'll be disappointed. Just go in looking for the "Disney always has a good moral behind its animated movies" type of movie and you will really enjoy it. Paul Newman and Larry the Cable Guy really have the best characters in the movie. And while John Ratzenberger's character doesn't have a lot of screen time, I really enjoyed him! I'll be going back to see it when it releases in theaters so I can get a better feel for the sound, as it wasn't the best in an outdoor setting. In my opinion, it easily beats the other animated movies released over the past year or so.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":393517,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.1},"contentRating":"G","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2006-09-06","keywords":"car,car movie,route 66,truck,tow truck","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"How the Best Racing Films Raise the Stakes","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi365149977","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjgwYTRjOTMtZWIwMy00Nzc2LWJiMDMtMDFkMjRhYTYwY2VmXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFsZWxvZw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"On this IMDbrief, sponsored by Coca-Cola, we're putting the pedal to the metal on the best racing films of all time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005562/","name":"Owen Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001372/","name":"Bonnie Hunt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005124/","name":"John Lasseter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0710020/","name":"Joe Ranft"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0460146/","name":"Jorgen Klubien"}],"duration":"PT1H57M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The photography was beautiful, the acting excellent, and the supporting players added an extra "punch" to the story line. Tho not an exact replica of the book it is based more on a story line running thru Crowe's and Marion's characters. The emphasis being on Crowe's character finding out what is truly meaningful in his very hectic super-charged rather non ethical life.

And, as an army of over 300,000 Brits dug in and waited, the Luftwaffe began chipping away at them....and ultimately would have killed and/or captured them all if it wasn't for a rag-tag flotilla of private boats which hastily arrived and spirited away about 80-90% of the men.\n\nBy the way, early in the film you hear someone speaking to the pilot (Tom Hardy) over the radio. The voice is that of Michael Caine....an odd and brief cameo.\n\nThe story is gripping, well told and brilliant. I have only one complaint, and I am surprised it made it to the film considering how amazing a director Christopher Nolan is. At one point, the scene switches between some men in a boat being attacked and a private yacht rescuing downed pilots.

The movie as a whole is extremely entertaining and exciting.The acting is awesome Eva Green actually does a great job and has really improved her acting from the last time i saw her (in kingdom of heaven), but then this is a totally different movie.\n\nThere's a lot of action mixed with great story which i am sure will please the true Bond fan.\n\nPlease go and watch this because you will regret if you don't, forget the past this is the New Bond.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":631938,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2006-11-15","keywords":"poker,james bond character,poker game,espionage,based on novel","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Casino Royale","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1859520025","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAxYzc2YTItMjhjZi00Y2E5LWFhYWMtNzY4ODFlZmQ2MzJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzAxYzc2YTItMjhjZi00Y2E5LWFhYWMtNzY4ODFlZmQ2MzJmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Casino Royale","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0185819/","name":"Daniel Craig","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1200692/","name":"Eva Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001132/","name":"Judi Dench"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0132709/","name":"Martin Campbell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0200563/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0353673/","name":"Paul Haggis"],"duration":"PT2H24M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.\n\nNever have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.\n\nI can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.\n\nThe writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.\n\nI'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":966247,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-02-17","keywords":"breaking the fourth wall,anti hero,sex scene,mercenary,revenge","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Even-More-Voiced-Over Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi567457049","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0Nzk0NzAzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1Njg5NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0Nzk0NzAzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1Njg5NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A groundbreaking 4th wall breaking trailer breakdown of a character who breaks the 4th wall, including extra voice-over on a trailer that includes a voice-over. 8 walls + 4 breaks + 2 voice overs = 1 game-changing superhero."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1072555/","name":"Morena Baccarin"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2554352/","name":"T.J.

A wisecracking mercenary gets experimented on and becomes immortal but ugly, and sets out to track down the man who ruined his looks." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1431045/","name":"Deadpool","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzE5MjY1ZDgtMTkyNC00MTMyLThhMjAtZGI5OTE1NzFlZGJjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjU0OTQ0OTY@._V1_.jpg","description":"A wisecracking mercenary gets experimented on and becomes immortal but ugly, and sets out to track down the man who ruined his looks.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1431045/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"adamsmith-51004","dateCreated":"2021-04-16","inLanguage":"English","name":""Please don't make the super suit green...or animated!"","reviewBody":"One of the greatest anti-hero - the Merc with a mouth - Wade Wilson was once a special forces operative but turned mercenary. After being subjected to a rogue experiment, he finds himself with accelerated healing and transforms himself into Deadpool. Armed with weapons (and a wicked sense of humour) he will stop at nothing to track down the men responsible.\n\nNever have I seen so many fans (or moviegoers), dying to see a character like Deadpool on the big screen; it's a bit like how everyone wanted to see The Avengers on the big screen back in late 2011. It's bad enough that the studios can't seem to get the character right with the disaster that was X-Men Origins: Wolverine. But the respect and love that fans have for this character stayed strong until everyone's prays was finally answered by this movie. And it did not disappoint, because Deadpool lives up to hype by being entertaining and hilarious. While I don't think it is a masterpiece of all comic book movies I did have fun watching this movie. It's a film that fans wanted and got.\n\nI can't imagine anyone else in Hollywood playing Deadpool but only Ryan Reynolds. He was born to play this character and he's the only actor that I think of to do the character justice. Reynolds as expected did that, and has made the character of Deadpool his own. He was terrific as the mouth talking, ant-hero bad-ass. This is Ryan Reynolds come back role after his past disasters roles that mostly involves Green Lantern and Origins Wolverine (that this movie brilliantly makes fun off). Reynolds was just perfect for this character and he did a great performance in this film. He delivered the comedic timing and the somewhat of a hidden charm that Deadpool has. Ryan Reynolds absolutely nailed it.\n\nThe writing in this movie was surprisingly good, which I didn't expect for a movie with this kind of character. Of course there are Easter eggs, references and nods to the comics and Marvel movies, but in this movie it's done in such a way that feels kind of refreshing. I know for a fact that I missed a lot of the jokes and references due to amount of laughter that I had while watching the movie. I can say it with a brave face that the writing is this movies biggest strength, because it's self awareness on Marvel movies and itself was all top notch.\n\nI'm so happy that this movie is rated 18 and not some watered down movie, because if you honestly think a Deadpool movie should be rated anything less then you really don't know the character at all.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":966247,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2016-02-17","keywords":"breaking the fourth wall,anti hero,sex scene,mercenary,revenge","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Even-More-Voiced-Over Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi567457049","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0Nzk0NzAzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1Njg5NzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTU0Nzk0NzAzN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTk1Njg5NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A groundbreaking 4th wall breaking trailer breakdown of a character who breaks the 4th wall, including extra voice-over on a trailer that includes a voice-over. 8 walls + 4 breaks + 2 voice overs = 1 game-changing superhero.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005351/","name":"Ryan Reynolds","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1072555/","name":"Morena Baccarin","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2554352/","name":"T.J.

A bit constraint editing under some meticulous vigilance could have done wonders and would have probably helped it, in its quest to be the best Bond movie of all time. \n\nAll being said and given what we have, the movie fails to disappoint the audience and will surely redefine the very prerequisites of an action movie and will definitely serve as a benchmark for the movies in the years to come.\n\nhttp://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":433920,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-11-05","keywords":"james bond character,water rights,spy hero,secret agent,british intelligence","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Quantum of Solace: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1024524313","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxNzc5NTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzkxNzc5NTc0OF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTYxNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the second theatrical trailer for Quantum of Solace, directed by Marc Forster."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0185819/","name":"Daniel Craig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1385871/","name":"Olga Kurylenko"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0023832/","name":"Mathieu Amalric"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0286975/","name":"Marc Forster"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0353673/","name":"Paul Haggis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0701031/","name":"Neal Purvis"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0905498/","name":"Robert Wade"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Unfortunately, his post-boxing career has not flourished which sees him going back to dead end jobs such as working at the meat packing company with his best friend and brother in law Paulie (Burt Young) to keep his head above financial dire straits and his newly wedded wife Adrian (Talia Shire) vows to stay loyal to him. Meanwhile, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is enraged by all the hate mail that he is receiving, mostly telling him that his championship match was nothing more than a fluke and vows to do everything in his power to goad Rocky Balboa into a rematch. Though Adrian is upset with Rocky's decision to return to the ring, Rocky teams back up with his trainer Mickey (Burgess Meredith) to regain his passion and pride.\n\nThe cast is faultless, and the spirit of the first movie still remains intact. In fact, I found the training scenes to be a lot more uplifting, and I found myself secretly cheering during the penultimate match. And the ending unashamedly had me in tears.\n\nI've always had a soft spot for Rocky II and years later, it's one of the few movies that has me going through a roller-coaster of emotions. In some ways, I wish this was the ending of the first Rocky movie. But it is what it is. Still Rocky II is a worthy sequel that goes the distance.\n\n8/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":201598,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1979-06-15","keywords":"rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,rocky balboa jr character,mickey goldmill character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rocky II","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2087782169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI5MjQ4YmEtMGVhNC00ZTYxLWEzNTctN2YzNTJiODg1OGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDI5MjQ4YmEtMGVhNC00ZTYxLWEzNTctN2YzNTJiODg1OGY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Rocky II","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054262/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

By now we are all aware of the story of how Stallone wrote the screenplay for Rocky in three days after watching a fight between an extreme underdog and a highly favoured champ.  Stallone was a nobody back then yet he still stood his ground and didn't sell out to the producers until they promised him the title role.  The rest they say is history.  Well 9 years later, after three Rocky films, in my opinion comes the best one.  I realize that Rocky was all story and then a climatic boxing match and that is what won the film the Oscar.  And even though I can admit that this film is not as concerned with character developement as it is with training montages and bulging muscles, it is by far and away the most entertaining film of the 5.  And that is what I enjoy about the film.  I love that Rocky IV has some of the best training montages ever filmed.  I love that it has the heart of a lion when it shows Rocky scaling a mountain that you know damn well he shouldn't be able to.  And I absolutely love the boxing match at the end of the film.  This was completely choreographed by Stallone and he and Dolph Lundgren boxed for real for about 75% of the match.  Stallone felt that it needed some authenticity so that was the way to do it.  And if you think Robert De Niro is an impressive method actor, try this fact on for size.  When filming the boxing match, some of the scenes were so real that Stallone was rushed to hospital because his heart was actually pushed up and his ribcage was slightly shattered.  So when you watch that match at the end, just know that what you are seeing is not exactly choreography and trick camera work.  They did the best job they could to keep the look of the fight as real as possible.  And I think this is the best boxing match ever filmed, with all due respect to Raging Bull. \n\n Stallone was in the shape of his life in this year as he filmed Rocky and Rambo back to back and it shows.  I have never seen a more sculpted man in the movies than he was here.  And I think that added to his superman persona.  If you notice in all the Rocky films, he grows a little each time. And that also adds to the enjoyment of the film.  \n\nRocky IV is different than Rocky, there is no doubt.  And as much as I love the first one, it doesn't come close to entertaining me as much as this one does.  Rocky IV starts fast and it ends hard and in between we are blessed with a great soundtrack and a beautiful montage of all the Rocky films to Robert Tepper's "There's No Easy Way Out"  And it is here that even though some will say that Stallone has substituted real human emotion with an MTV ersatz video, I think it works well.  There is nothing about this film that I didn't enjoy and if you forget what the experience of watching this one is like, I suggest that you rent it now and take a look at it.  And try to remember what it was like when you first saw this film back in the winter of 85.  I remember I was in Kokomo Indiana visiting family for Christmas.  My mom and I walked into a packed theater and you want to talk about a place erupting like a volcano, then this was the place.  When Rocky finally hits Drago to cut him over the eye and Duke yells " he's cut, he's cut! "  the crowd went into a frenzy.  And you can look no further than that as to why the Rocky films were so popular.  It doesn't matter if you are Canadian, American, Portuguese, Polish or Dutch or whatever, Rocky appeals to all of us.  Because all of us have been the underdog at some time in our lives and we love to watch him and perhaps live vicariously through him.  That is the beauty of Rocky.  If Rocky can do it then dammit so can I! \n\n When the movie ended on that cold night back in 1985, and people were filtering out to their cars for the drive home, I swear I could hear the crowd chanting his name, as did the millions..... and millions of the Rock's fans.  \n\n" Rocky!

But it's not as bad as people say and as the sixth instalment nears completion it's about time everyone got back into the Rocky spirit for one more round.\n\nA good film. 7/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":133179,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1990-11-16","keywords":"rocky balboa jr character,rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,mickey goldmill character","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

I wondered why Rocky was telling D to not fight Drago when Rocky didn't exactly the same thing to avenge Apollo's death? The movie was dry and soulless.

The town is dying as its mines close down. Susan Smith (Emilia Clarke) survive by welfare fraud and selling drugs with her husband Cash (Johnny Knoxville). When the cops catch them, she turns into a confidential informant for FBI agent Mark Putnam (Jack Huston). She starts having an affair with him despite his wife Kathy (Sophie Lowe) and kids.\n\nThis is supposedly a true story. Emilia Clarke is doing her best southern white trash work. This is really a character study of her dealing with a disintegrating obsessive sexual relationship. I would like a different person playing Mark Putnam. The movie plays into the buttoned up FBI agent ideals of the man. I want someone with more edge. I want Knoxville if he could start with a clean-cut look. That pairing would be more interesting. Jack Huston is doing straight-laced too well. He should do more disintegration. The obsessive relationship loses some of its power.

The town is dying as its mines close down. Susan Smith (Emilia Clarke) survive by welfare fraud and selling drugs with her husband Cash (Johnny Knoxville). When the cops catch them, she turns into a confidential informant for FBI agent Mark Putnam (Jack Huston). She starts having an affair with him despite his wife Kathy (Sophie Lowe) and kids.\n\nThis is supposedly a true story. Emilia Clarke is doing her best southern white trash work. This is really a character study of her dealing with a disintegrating obsessive sexual relationship. I would like a different person playing Mark Putnam. The movie plays into the buttoned up FBI agent ideals of the man. I want someone with more edge. I want Knoxville if he could start with a clean-cut look. That pairing would be more interesting. Jack Huston is doing straight-laced too well. He should do more disintegration. The obsessive relationship loses some of its power.

Outlaws on the run have been fertile ground for movies over the years, and young director Miles Joris-Peyrafitte and writer Nicolas Zwart give the genre their best shot (pun intended). The easiest comparisons are probably Sam Peckinpah's THE GETAWAY (1972), Jonathan Demme's SOMETHING WILD (1986), and Arthur Penn's Oscar nominated classic BONNIE AND CLYDE (1969). However, given the style of this film, Terrence Malick's BADLANDS (1973) was likely more of an influence for the filmmakers.\n\nPhoebe Evans (as voiced by Lola Kirke, GONE GIRL, daughter of Bad Company drummer Simon Kirke) is our narrator, and from 1955 she recounts the story of her half-brother Eugene. Most of what she tells takes place twenty years earlier - 1935 Dust Bowl Texas during the Great Depression. Finn Cole ("Animal Kingdom") stars as Eugene, and we pick up a few years after his dad left the family behind and headed for what he expected would be an easier life in Mexico. Mother Elizabeth (Kerry Condon, "Breaking Bad") is now re-married to local Deputy George Evans (Travis Fimmel, LEAN ON PETE) and his bad haircut, and they now have a young daughter Phoebe (the magical smile of Darby Camp, THE CHRISTMAS CHRONICLES). Eugene reads Detective stories and mostly tries to stay out of George's way, while Phoebe is a curious little sister, easily the most intelligent of the lot.\n\nOne fateful day, Eugene's beloved detective stories come to life. After a local bank robbery turns violent, he discovers Allison Wells (two-time Oscar nominee Margot Robbie, I TONYA) hiding in his barn, with a bullet in her leg. Despite the $10,000 reward on her head, Allison sweet talks young Eugene into keeping her whereabouts secret, and helping her plot an escape. She swears she didn't kill anyone and rationalizes the bank robbery by blaming the government for letting people suffer hard times. Eugene may or may not buy her story, but he recognizes this is the most excitement he's likely to ever have in his life ... plus, he's smitten.\n\nDuring the first half of the film, we follow Eugene as he helps Allison and holds the secret. When the second half kicks in, we find ourselves along for the ride as the two are on the run from the law, including Eugene's stepfather George. Along the way director Joris-Peyrafitte includes some flashbacks to the botched bank robbery giving us a look at Allison's "Clyde", Perry Montroy (played by Garrett Hedlund). There are also numerous artsy flashes of coastline, supposedly representing Allison and Eugene's landing spot should they escape. Of course, we know where this is headed - a shootout finale. Filmed in New Mexico, we do get the feel of the hard life fought by those during this era, including the powerful and devastating dust storms that require gas masks to prevent suffocation. The film is watchable thanks to the performances and atmosphere, though it's not at the level of similar type movies listed earlier.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5108,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-11-17","keywords":"bullet wound,dust storm,bank robbery,shot in the back,shot in the leg","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dreamland","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi264552729","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4NWFiZmMtODNjNC00ZmI4LWFkMTktNTU1NTAxMGQ4YTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4NWFiZmMtODNjNC00ZmI4LWFkMTktNTU1NTAxMGQ4YTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6806440/","name":"Finn Cole"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1379938/","name":"Travis Fimmel"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3098802/","name":"Miles Joris-Peyrafitte"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323227/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0650540/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0542434/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4299678/","name":"Nicolaas Zwart"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Mother Elizabeth (Kerry Condon, "Breaking Bad") is now re-married to local Deputy George Evans (Travis Fimmel, LEAN ON PETE) and his bad haircut, and they now have a young daughter Phoebe (the magical smile of Darby Camp, THE CHRISTMAS CHRONICLES). Eugene reads Detective stories and mostly tries to stay out of George's way, while Phoebe is a curious little sister, easily the most intelligent of the lot.\n\nOne fateful day, Eugene's beloved detective stories come to life. After a local bank robbery turns violent, he discovers Allison Wells (two-time Oscar nominee Margot Robbie, I TONYA) hiding in his barn, with a bullet in her leg. Despite the $10,000 reward on her head, Allison sweet talks young Eugene into keeping her whereabouts secret, and helping her plot an escape. She swears she didn't kill anyone and rationalizes the bank robbery by blaming the government for letting people suffer hard times. Eugene may or may not buy her story, but he recognizes this is the most excitement he's likely to ever have in his life ... plus, he's smitten.\n\nDuring the first half of the film, we follow Eugene as he helps Allison and holds the secret. When the second half kicks in, we find ourselves along for the ride as the two are on the run from the law, including Eugene's stepfather George. Along the way director Joris-Peyrafitte includes some flashbacks to the botched bank robbery giving us a look at Allison's "Clyde", Perry Montroy (played by Garrett Hedlund). There are also numerous artsy flashes of coastline, supposedly representing Allison and Eugene's landing spot should they escape. Of course, we know where this is headed - a shootout finale. Filmed in New Mexico, we do get the feel of the hard life fought by those during this era, including the powerful and devastating dust storms that require gas masks to prevent suffocation. The film is watchable thanks to the performances and atmosphere, though it's not at the level of similar type movies listed earlier.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5108,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-11-17","keywords":"bullet wound,dust storm,bank robbery,shot in the back,shot in the leg","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dreamland","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi264552729","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4NWFiZmMtODNjNC00ZmI4LWFkMTktNTU1NTAxMGQ4YTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzk4NWFiZmMtODNjNC00ZmI4LWFkMTktNTU1NTAxMGQ4YTFhXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6806440/","name":"Finn Cole","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3053338/","name":"Margot Robbie","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1379938/","name":"Travis Fimmel"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3098802/","name":"Miles Joris-Peyrafitte"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0323227/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0650540/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0542434/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4299678/","name":"Nicolaas Zwart"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The greedy hunter takes the cash, but soon discovers that the resourceful criminal responsible for the drug deal, an outlaw named Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), has a way of tracking the loot. The hunter thus finds that he is the hunted. Meanwhile, an aging Texas sheriff named Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones) is after both the sportsman and Chigurh. The story is set in the early 1980s.\n\nTo some extent, this film is a character study of Sheriff Bell, an honest lawman who is wise, observant, grounded in reality, and has a long memory. "No Country For Old Men" is really his story. He doesn't know quite what to make of the drug war that has crossed over from Mexico into Texas; it's something new (for the 1980s); and it makes a land that has always been hostile to settlers even more hostile and dangerous.\n\nThe film's premise is quite simple, and the story is straightforward with minimal twists. A lot of time and care are taken with procedural actions: loading a gun, dressing a bloody wound, constructing a pole to retrieve a package from an air vent, for example. Dialogue is minimal; there's lots of silence.\n\nOverall casting and acting are impressive. I especially liked the performance of Tommy Lee Jones who seemed a natural choice for the role of Sheriff. Javier Bardem and Josh Brolin are also well cast. Several minor roles are extremely well performed, like the store owner who is asked to call a coin toss, and the rotund lady who, with a dour face, defies Chigurh's requests in a characteristic Texas twang.\n\nThe film's color cinematography is quite good; there are lots of sweeping, wide-angle outdoor shots. I really enjoyed the geographic setting, with that whistling West Texas wind, the silence, and the stunning vistas. It's a landscape that is starkly beautiful. Yet, despite its beauty and wilderness traits, it can quickly turn hostile and unforgiving for anyone unprepared for its hidden risks.\n\n"No Country For Old Men" is a fine film. I'd describe it as a chase story -- character study combo, with elements of noir, especially in the visuals. Violence may be a tad much for some viewers. But given the subject matter, it is entirely appropriate.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":916202,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2008-04-02","keywords":"sheriff,texas,contemporary western,cold blooded murder,desert","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi145883417","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzRhYmExOTUtYjJjNy00MjRlLTkzNzktZjkwNWJmMmE5NzMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQUlNRGJWaWRlb1RodW1ibmFpbFNlcnZpY2U@._V1_.jpg","description":"No Country for Old Men Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000169/","name":"Tommy Lee Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000849/","name":"Javier Bardem"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000982/","name":"Josh Brolin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0179341/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0093765/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001054/","name":"Joel Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001053/","name":"Ethan Coen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0565092/","name":"Cormac McCarthy"}],"duration":"PT2H2M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

    <review type="text">IMDb data; ttnr: 7660970, Title: The North Water, 
 --- Description: The North Water: With Jack O'Connell, Colin Farrell, Sam Spruell, Roland Møller. The North Water tells the story of Patrick Sumner, a disgraced ex-army surgeon who signs up as ship's doctor on a whaling expedition to the Arctic. On board he meets Henry Drax, the harpooner, a brutish killer whose amorality has been shaped to fit the harshness of his world. Hoping to escape the horrors of his past, Sumner finds himself on an ill-fated journey with a murderous psychopath. In search of redemption, his story becomes a harsh struggle for survival in the Arctic wasteland." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"TVSeries","url":"/title/tt7660970/","name":"The North Water","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTVjNmY4ZmYtMjIwYy00NGIwLWJhYmMtOWFkZjYyMmRmMTY2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEyMjM2NDc2._V1_.jpg","description":"The North Water tells the story of Patrick Sumner, a disgraced ex-army surgeon who signs up as ship's doctor on a whaling expedition to the Arctic.

I think it's quite interesting because of the script, characters and settings. A tense and raw experience.\n\nSecond, acting here is amazing in general, but specially from Collin Farrell. I think his character is the best. Brutal, savage and pretty well performed by Collin. Probably, his best acting in years.\n\nLast, I haven't read the book yet to clarify the plot holes in the series. I'm not sure why we don't know more about several characters and what happened to them.\n\nOn the contrary, last episode was the weakest one. Specially the last 20 minutes are extremely predictable to conclude the story. A wasted opportunity tu create something excellent.\n\nSo, to sum up, if you liked series like The Terror (season 1), I suggest to watch this show.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":8618,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Adventure","Drama","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2021-09-10","keywords":"19th century,whaler,doctor,sailing ship,arctic","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1925239/","name":"Jack O'Connell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0819874/","name":"Sam Spruell"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0230132/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010810/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi285523993","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE1ZDQwYmUtNjU4NS00NWNkLWIzMWMtYmJhMzE0ZTlhNmNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTE1ZDQwYmUtNjU4NS00NWNkLWIzMWMtYmJhMzE0ZTlhNmNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"The North Water premieres July 15 exclusively on AMC+."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A little known independent film called The Nest proves that point rather well. Director / writer Sean Durkin sets an ominous tone from the onset in this psychological study about a family coming undone with their abrupt relocation from America to the UK. To say that the move does not go well is an understatement.\n\nRory O'Hara and his lovely wife, Allison, live the perfect storybook life. He is a rich trader and she is his pampered trophy wife caught in 80's opulence and living the good life. All seems well enough on the surface with the O'Hara's until Rory decides to head back to his hometown of London and uproot his family. One small problem: Rory is a grifter and liar and he and his family will be forced to make the ultimate sacrifices due to his overt actions.\n\nThe family dynamic is odd from the start. Unexplained circumstances occur with some subtle but mostly heavy-handed symbolism (a dark horse buried and suddenly exhumed, an expensive fur coat showing personal greed and wealth, doors unable to lock, hidden cigarette butts indicating rebellion, a wool sweater showing character enabling, etc.). The on-going tension slowly builds and personality traits morph these characters into totally different individuals,: Samantha (Oona Roche) becomes the defiant teenage daughter, Ben (Charlie Shotwell) morphs into a introverted young boy and the husband/wife tag team, expertly played by Jude Law and Carrie Coons, become a warring tribe sorting through all of their self-centered behaviors. Mr. Durkin's screenplay establishes its tone most effectively, but only hints at the betrayals and destructive behaviors of this family. Scenes of more direct conflict could have created to produce a more concise family portrait.\n\nStill most of the film is atmospheric and engaging due to Sean Durkin's fine direction and the acting of Mr. Law and Ms. Coons as the battling spouses. They are very good in their roles and bring their characters' self-indulgences and bitternesses centerstage. Their explosive scenes are terrific when they finally arrive as they snipe and rage at each other, but they are rarely viewed. Most of their inner anger stays within, always simmering to the top, yet rarely brims over. As their children, both Ms. Roche and Mr. Shotwell are totally convincing as pawns in their parent's gamesmanship.\n\nThe Nest is a special type of film, more for those moviegoers interested in psychological tension, creepy atmosphere, and well-define characters than a plot-driven story with definite results. Despite much to admire, this nest is a tad empty.

A little known independent film called The Nest proves that point rather well. Director / writer Sean Durkin sets an ominous tone from the onset in this psychological study about a family coming undone with their abrupt relocation from America to the UK. To say that the move does not go well is an understatement.\n\nRory O'Hara and his lovely wife, Allison, live the perfect storybook life. He is a rich trader and she is his pampered trophy wife caught in 80's opulence and living the good life. All seems well enough on the surface with the O'Hara's until Rory decides to head back to his hometown of London and uproot his family. One small problem: Rory is a grifter and liar and he and his family will be forced to make the ultimate sacrifices due to his overt actions.\n\nThe family dynamic is odd from the start. Unexplained circumstances occur with some subtle but mostly heavy-handed symbolism (a dark horse buried and suddenly exhumed, an expensive fur coat showing personal greed and wealth, doors unable to lock, hidden cigarette butts indicating rebellion, a wool sweater showing character enabling, etc.). The on-going tension slowly builds and personality traits morph these characters into totally different individuals,: Samantha (Oona Roche) becomes the defiant teenage daughter, Ben (Charlie Shotwell) morphs into a introverted young boy and the husband/wife tag team, expertly played by Jude Law and Carrie Coons, become a warring tribe sorting through all of their self-centered behaviors. Mr. Durkin's screenplay establishes its tone most effectively, but only hints at the betrayals and destructive behaviors of this family. Scenes of more direct conflict could have created to produce a more concise family portrait.\n\nStill most of the film is atmospheric and engaging due to Sean Durkin's fine direction and the acting of Mr. Law and Ms. Coons as the battling spouses. They are very good in their roles and bring their characters' self-indulgences and bitternesses centerstage. Their explosive scenes are terrific when they finally arrive as they snipe and rage at each other, but they are rarely viewed. Most of their inner anger stays within, always simmering to the top, yet rarely brims over. As their children, both Ms. Roche and Mr. Shotwell are totally convincing as pawns in their parent's gamesmanship.\n\nThe Nest is a special type of film, more for those moviegoers interested in psychological tension, creepy atmosphere, and well-define characters than a plot-driven story with definite results. Despite much to admire, this nest is a tad empty.

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":702453,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades. While many will be very sad to see Jackman step down from the role, he couldn't have picked a better or more satisfying film to end his cinematic legacy with.\n\nThe film takes place in 2029 and shows the world in shambles. Mutants are nearly extinct, water is scarce and the world is just an overall wasteland. This is where we find Logan. He is a limo driving cantankerous caretaker to an even more cantankerous Professor X, who is now suffering from dementia and seizures. He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to.

There's no doubt the two have chemistry. What there is doubt about is how to perfectly utilise each of the two as characters. The problem is that for Wahlberg's confident, in-charge character (which he has to play) to work Ferrell needs to play the straight guy and that isn't when he's at his best. He does it well there's no doubt about it, but he's at his best when his character has an edge to him like 'Ron Burgundy' or his character in 'Step Brothers'. Playing the overly straight guy just seems almost a waste for the one Ferrell movie we get a year, even though no one could deny he still does it very well. \n\nThe difference in quality between this and 'Get Hard' is noticeable. There, Kevin Hart was unable to find a chemistry with Ferrell and it just turned into the two competing with each other trying to make the movie their own. Here that's not the case. Wahlberg seems happy to let Ferrell take the reins and is comfortable just doing what he does best, with his laid back, dry sense of humour accompanying Ferrell perfectly. \n\nThere are consistent laughs throughout, but perhaps not one stand out scene that will be memorable for years to come. It doesn't push the envelope as much as other Ferrell movies have in the past either. I really would love to see him always be given free rein to say and do as he pleases but also understand why that can't always be the case. If you're just looking to get your annual fix of a bit of Ferrell hilarity then you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for a game-changer, perhaps wait for the next one.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":115615,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2015-12-30","keywords":"sweat,pull,pull ups,push,muscle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1706799641","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM0NjMzMzAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQwMjExNzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM0NjMzMzAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQwMjExNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A mild-mannered radio executive strives to become the best stepdad to his wife's two children, but complications ensue when their freewheeling and freeloading real father arrives, forcing him to compete for the affection of the kids."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002071/","name":"Will Ferrell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004802/","name":"Linda Cardellini"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1890845/","name":"Sean Anders"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0325207/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0186190/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0122602/","name":"Brian Burns"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1890845/","name":"Sean Anders"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1898234/","name":"John Morris"}],"duration":"PT1H36M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Wahlberg seems happy to let Ferrell take the reins and is comfortable just doing what he does best, with his laid back, dry sense of humour accompanying Ferrell perfectly. \n\nThere are consistent laughs throughout, but perhaps not one stand out scene that will be memorable for years to come. It doesn't push the envelope as much as other Ferrell movies have in the past either. I really would love to see him always be given free rein to say and do as he pleases but also understand why that can't always be the case. If you're just looking to get your annual fix of a bit of Ferrell hilarity then you won't be disappointed. If you are looking for a game-changer, perhaps wait for the next one.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":115615,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2015-12-30","keywords":"sweat,pull,pull ups,push,muscle","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1706799641","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM0NjMzMzAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQwMjExNzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzM0NjMzMzAzOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTQwMjExNzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A mild-mannered radio executive strives to become the best stepdad to his wife's two children, but complications ensue when their freewheeling and freeloading real father arrives, forcing him to compete for the affection of the kids.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002071/","name":"Will Ferrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004802/","name":"Linda Cardellini"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1890845/","name":"Sean Anders"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0325207/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0186190/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0122602/","name":"Brian Burns","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1890845/","name":"Sean Anders","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1898234/","name":"John Morris"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">Precious: Directed by Lee Daniels. With Gabourey Sidibe, Mo'Nique, Paula Patton, Mariah Carey.

Life is short. Life is painful. Life is rich. Life is....Precious.","reviewBody":"This is a film that might make some people a little uneasy. It deals with family abuse in the form of rape, physical and verbal violence. The one character it follows is Precious, an overweight illiterate teenage girl who is pregnant with her second child from her biological father. She is kicked out of her school because of her pregnancy and is enrolled in another educational institution called each one teach one. She wants to do better things, but doesn't have the will or motivation because of the constant abuse at the hands of her mother. She day dreams about being a big star and getting out of the hellish life she lives.\n\nThe film is raw with the material and doesn't really hold any punches. Lee Daniels second feature film shows vast improvement over the messy Shadowboxer starring Cuba good Jr. His grasp of the material and dedication to have the story be told is evident in his attention to translate the novel to screen. Daniels has put together a cast that care about the subject matter and the story as much as he does and is surrounded by the talent that is needed to pull it off. \n\nGabourey Sidibe is Precious, the troubled teen wanting more out of life. She shines in her first starring role and it's no walk in the park for her. The role demanded talent and Sidibe delivers what is needed. Of course the one who stands out the most is Mo'Nique earning herself a much deserved Oscar for her role as the abusive and sloth ridden mother. Her confrontation with her daughter after the birth of the second child is intense and will have you holding your breath in fear for the safety of the child. \n\nPrecious is a film that is driven by a strong story and an emotional cast that cares about the work they are doing. It's a glimmer of hope that keeps the story moving in a world that is hard edged and usually leads nowhere.

 --- Description: Precious: Directed by Lee Daniels. With Gabourey Sidibe, Mo'Nique, Paula Patton, Mariah Carey. In New York City's Harlem circa 1987, an overweight, abused, illiterate teen who is pregnant with her second child is invited to enroll in an alternative school in hopes that her life can head in a new direction." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt0929632/","name":"Precious","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk3NDM4ODMwNl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMTYyNDIzMw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"In New York City's Harlem circa 1987, an overweight, abused, illiterate teen who is pregnant with her second child is invited to enroll in an alternative school in hopes that her life can head in a new direction.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt0929632/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"Matt_Layden","dateCreated":"2010-09-15","inLanguage":"English","name":"Life is hard. Life is short. Life is painful. Life is rich. Life is....Precious.","reviewBody":"This is a film that might make some people a little uneasy. It deals with family abuse in the form of rape, physical and verbal violence. The one character it follows is Precious, an overweight illiterate teenage girl who is pregnant with her second child from her biological father. She is kicked out of her school because of her pregnancy and is enrolled in another educational institution called each one teach one. She wants to do better things, but doesn't have the will or motivation because of the constant abuse at the hands of her mother. She day dreams about being a big star and getting out of the hellish life she lives.\n\nThe film is raw with the material and doesn't really hold any punches. Lee Daniels second feature film shows vast improvement over the messy Shadowboxer starring Cuba good Jr. His grasp of the material and dedication to have the story be told is evident in his attention to translate the novel to screen. Daniels has put together a cast that care about the subject matter and the story as much as he does and is surrounded by the talent that is needed to pull it off. \n\nGabourey Sidibe is Precious, the troubled teen wanting more out of life. She shines in her first starring role and it's no walk in the park for her. The role demanded talent and Sidibe delivers what is needed. Of course the one who stands out the most is Mo'Nique earning herself a much deserved Oscar for her role as the abusive and sloth ridden mother. Her confrontation with her daughter after the birth of the second child is intense and will have you holding your breath in fear for the safety of the child. \n\nPrecious is a film that is driven by a strong story and an emotional cast that cares about the work they are doing. It's a glimmer of hope that keeps the story moving in a world that is hard edged and usually leads nowhere. It's not a relatively long film, but I did find myself checking my watch every now and then and some bits in the film happen without much clarification. Where did that one white boy come from in her Each One Teach One class? In any event, the final product is a good film with a message about hope and Tyler Perry finally has his name attached to something good in his career (Star Trek not included).","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":108913,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2009-11-20","keywords":"lesbian couple,lesbian,f rated,self narration,mother daughter conflict","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Precious: Based on the Novel Push by Sapphire -- Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1522402585","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk0MTg2OTA3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA3MDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjk0MTg2OTA3NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzA3MDAyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"In Harlem, an overweight, illiterate teen (Sidibe) who is pregnant with her second child is invited to enroll in an alternative school in hopes that her life can head in a new direction.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2829737/","name":"Gabourey Sidibe","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0594898/","name":"Mo'Nique","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1745736/","name":"Paula Patton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0200005/","name":"Lee Daniels"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048235/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0223834/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2819316/","name":"Geoffrey Fletcher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2497119/","name":"Sapphire"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Overall it's a good watch and the characters are generally believable and even likeable.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":809,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7,"genre":["Comedy","Family","Romance"],"datePublished":"2017-12-10","keywords":"love,christmas","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3858768/","name":"Brely Evans","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1822183/","name":"Andra Fuller","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0925316/","name":"Persia White"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949774/","name":"Kenny Young"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0410661/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9218837/","name":"Marnie Martin"],"duration":"PT1H27M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

There are points where the movie is a little slow, but not slow enough to loose your interest.\n\nAll of the characters are wonderfully developed especially Jude Laws-the under-story of Jude's character adds an extra dimension to his character and really makes you love him all the more.\n\nKate Winslet's character is another that was well worked out. She helps out this little old man . . . and the character development between her and this older gentleman is wonderful . . . it adds so much to her character, makes her more human, more real, someone very likable and someone you want to end up with a good ending.\n\nJack Black's character was sweet, not corny . . . and you end up liking him very much. He was not a goober like he usually is in his movies.\n\nOver all, it was a wonderfully character driven movie, that was enjoyable and had you leaving the theater feeling good.

There are points where the movie is a little slow, but not slow enough to loose your interest.\n\nAll of the characters are wonderfully developed especially Jude Laws-the under-story of Jude's character adds an extra dimension to his character and really makes you love him all the more.\n\nKate Winslet's character is another that was well worked out. She helps out this little old man . . . and the character development between her and this older gentleman is wonderful . . . it adds so much to her character, makes her more human, more real, someone very likable and someone you want to end up with a good ending.\n\nJack Black's character was sweet, not corny . . . and you end up liking him very much. He was not a goober like he usually is in his movies.\n\nOver all, it was a wonderfully character driven movie, that was enjoyable and had you leaving the theater feeling good. I recommend it highly!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":272438,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-12-13","keywords":"kiss,film composer,english countryside,cottage,book editor","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Holiday","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3321037081","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUzMGJkZjEtYTRkYS00ZTcwLWI2YTUtYTA0YjlhYTBhMzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWUzMGJkZjEtYTRkYS00ZTcwLWI2YTUtYTA0YjlhYTBhMzQyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from Columbia Pictures","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000701/","name":"Kate Winslet","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000139/","name":"Cameron Diaz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000179/","name":"Jude Law"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0583600/","name":"Nancy Meyers"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0142678/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0583600/","name":"Nancy Meyers"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Lawrence plays FBI Agent Malcolm Turner who goes undercover as "Big Momma" Hattie Mae Pierce (Ella Mitchell), so as to hopefully snare escaped convict Lester Vesco (Howard). "Big Momma" is the aunt of Vesco's ex-wife, Sherry (Long), who is on her way to "Big Momma's" to hide out after hearing of Lester's escape.\n\nIn spite of baffling critics-and not finding many casual film viewers willing to say they enjoyed it! the film was a surprise hit and opened as the number two movie in North America. It went on to gross over $117 million at the box office and subsequently ensured that a sequel would follow down the line (it arrived in 2006). The film isn't pretending to be anything other than the mindless comedy it is. If viewed on those terms then it can be enjoyed. Sure some of the gags are puerile, and Lawrence is an acquired taste, tho his energy and comedy timing are first rate here. But it does work to a degree.

Lawrence plays FBI Agent Malcolm Turner who goes undercover as "Big Momma" Hattie Mae Pierce (Ella Mitchell), so as to hopefully snare escaped convict Lester Vesco (Howard). "Big Momma" is the aunt of Vesco's ex-wife, Sherry (Long), who is on her way to "Big Momma's" to hide out after hearing of Lester's escape.\n\nIn spite of baffling critics-and not finding many casual film viewers willing to say they enjoyed it! the film was a surprise hit and opened as the number two movie in North America. It went on to gross over $117 million at the box office and subsequently ensured that a sequel would follow down the line (it arrived in 2006). The film isn't pretending to be anything other than the mindless comedy it is. If viewed on those terms then it can be enjoyed. Sure some of the gags are puerile, and Lawrence is an acquired taste, tho his energy and comedy timing are first rate here. But it does work to a degree. It's been done better in the likes of Tootsie and Mrs. Doubtfire, and the plot, with it's boorish romantic strand, is merely an excuse for "Big Momma" to get into daft scrapes.

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Jackson has now solidly replaced Spielberg.\n\nMost folks know that the 1933 "Kong" changed the world in fundamental ways. The world of movie imagination was in its earliest phases, so quite apart from the innovations of animation and dramatic scoring, the engineering of the narrative was radical and important -- the idea of making a movie about making a movie. Was it the first major film with such explicit folding?\n\nIt is a movie about the making of a movie that gets out of hand so the inner movie takes over the enclosing one. Then a larger crew gets involved and subdues the "beast" (the energy of the thing) and recasts it as a slightly different type of show, the "real" thing. This also gets out of hand in the same way. The form is nominally a beauty and the beast love story, but inside it is a similar beauty and the beast story about the notions of dangerous storytelling.\n\nFortunately, we have the Jackson of "Forgotten Silver," "Heavenly Creatures" and "Meet the Freebles," all in this family of reflection.\n\nThis Kong sets the human lover as the actual playwright who (literally) is writing what we see as we go along. He intends to be outside the play, but gets swept up in it as the venture (again, literally) leaves with him aboard. When looking for an actress, Denham asks about Fay, and is told she is filming something for RKO, the original Kong, in fact.\n\nThe big layer is that when the Kong show comes to 1933 New York, the costumes and music are from the 1933 film. How clever, to overlap the layer of original-remake with that in the story of movie within layered on the "real" thing. The business about the monster coming off the stage/screen and entering the audience is a fold-shifting device visited many times since.\n\nI understand there are a quite a few more subtle 'movie within the movie" touches that Jackson intends to add in the DVD cut. We see one in the trailer where the inner filmmaker is directing Ann to scream. \n\nJackson cleverly adds in a few narrative references as well. This is an intelligent filmmaker, after all. The obvious one is "Heart of Darkness," (and by reference, "Apocalypse Now"), which he slips in explicitly and then satirizes by that quaint foolishness of the mentor and lost boy.\n\nBut the insertion he makes that is not explicit is the one that fascinates me: "The Tempest," sort of a touchstone for this notion of folded narrative and how it is added as yet another layer is a pleasant surprise.\n\nIf (shame) you don't know the Tempest, here is an outline: a magician (Shakespeare who is both in the play and writing it) lives on a lost island with magical creatures. He conspires to raise the titular tempest which brings a shipload of folks to the island where he works his magic. His conjuring of the tempest presumably goes back in time to include all the events leading to the reasons the people are on the ship.\n\nThe tempest involves an enveloping fog, rocks that appear from nowhere and no escape for experienced mariners.\n\nOnce on the island, there are a few plays-within-plays created and manipulated by the magician, some exposure to the feral animal energies of the place, and a love between a young couple. There's much ado about the abject loneliness of our magician.\n\n(Incidentally, implicit in this Kong story is that this monster ape is the very last in the line. When he takes his new love to see the sunset, he takes her past the family boneyard. There, you can see that there was a long line of giants before him that at each stage had a loved companion where he does not.)\n\nQuite apart from that, you can see Ted's law at work here and in "The Tempest." That law holds that when you have two layers, a film and a play or film within, the distance of abstraction between us and the outer film is the same as that between the outer film and the inner one. This is true in the four explicit inner plays: the movie Denham makes, the play Jack writes (where he talks to himself about love), the Kong show (which references the 33 movie) and the stage performances Ann does throughout, including for Kong (which is pure Jackson).\n\nAll this business about narrative dimension is mirrored in the physical dimensions as well. Jackson knows how to work in the three dimensions that animation gives him the freedom to exploit. At least we got that out of his adventures with fascist romantic cosmology. If you just watched the fight between Kong and the two dinos suspended by vines as they and we swoop about, you'd get your money's worth. And that would be both in entertainment and knowing you are seeing something that will change all action movies that follow. The planes at the end have camera perspectives we haven't seen before as well.\n\nThis is a masterwork. My one complaint is the lack of sex. Yes, I know. Mooneyes are enough, and anything more works against the abstraction of the thing. But that business about smell in the 33 version was piercingly raw and human. It is a shame that to sell big it had to be replaced with some business about her "entertaining" him. But it does keep the performance levels straight.\n\nTed's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":410409,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2006-01-25","keywords":"gorilla,king kong,island,new york city,jungle","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4100440345","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5YjhlYzgtZWY2Yy00NDYwLTgyMjUtODI4ZDBmNTkzNWVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E5YjhlYzgtZWY2Yy00NDYwLTgyMjUtODI4ZDBmNTkzNWVlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A greedy film producer assembles a team of moviemakers and sets out for the infamous Skull Island, where they find more than just cannibalistic natives."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0915208/","name":"Naomi Watts"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085312/","name":"Jack Black"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004778/","name":"Adrien Brody"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0046203/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0135516/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0909638/","name":"Fran Walsh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0101991/","name":"Philippa Boyens"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001392/","name":"Peter Jackson"}],"duration":"PT3H7M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none. The characterization may be just a little heavy (Bale's character going from not understanding a question about what he felt when his wife was incinerated to having a soft spot for puppies, etc.), but like another outstanding and equally over-the-top film, Shoot 'Em Up, nothing is out of place. All of the excesses look right at home. \n\nIt is interesting to consider the real-world implications of the content of the movie though, regardless of how unrealistic it is. The totalitarian regime, for example, resembles Mao Tse- tung's manner of oppression with startling closeness, even down to the children spying on and reporting their parents. Under Mao, children who reported their parents engaging in "counter'-revolutionary activities" were publicly hailed as national heroes while their parents were generally tortured and executed. Whether the crimes were real or not was unimportant, what mattered is that, as you can imagine, in a society where people were so easily made to desperately fear their own children, you can imagine the level of control the government (Mao) had over the people. Something similar happens in this movie.\n\nThe similarities to The Matrix films are obvious, but limited mostly to superficial things like the fight scenes and some costumes. Thematically, the movies are totally different, and even with all of the similarities, this movie is more than able to stand on its own, and any similarities are more just an unfortunate bit of timing, as this is probably what caused the movie to be so overlooked. If you can't handle a little excess in the movies, definitely stay away from this one. But if you can watch a movie just for a good time, you could do a lot worse than this.\n\nNote: Keep your eye out for Dominic Purcell, Prison Break's Lincoln Burrows, in the opening scene. He should have had a bigger role in the movie...","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":321049,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2005-01-12","keywords":"dystopia,suppression of emotion,gun fu,law,brainwashing","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Equilibrium","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi368025113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTg5NmRmYzUtYzM3MS00OWU0LTgzYmMtNzc2OTFkZGZhMzI5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000288/","name":"Christian Bale"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000293/","name":"Sean Bean"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001833/","name":"Emily Watson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019626/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007610/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0934483/","name":"Kurt Wimmer"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

To tell you the truth I was certain that it was going to be a goofy, direct-to-video sci-fi fiasco that most involved would just as soon forget. The cover box reminded me of Universal Soldier. As it turns out however, it's not a movie that those involved want to forget, it's an overlooked gem, no doubt because it came at the height of the Matrix craze, which it may resemble in too many ways. Unfortunately, too many people will callously write it off as a Matrix rip-off, and it's a shame because this is one of the best science fiction films to have come along in quite some time. \n\nIt takes place in the far off 21st century, but it's not about the future (given that it exists in a future that can't ever exist), it's about the disturbing reality that war is a part of human nature, and in order to eradicate it from the modern world we would have to become a homogenized society of emotionless, drug-controlled zombies. No jokes about that already being a reality.\n\nThe movie's biggest assertion is that it assigns blame for man's inhumanity to man to his ability to feel (ignoring the real causes, such as religion, political power, and less dogmatic things like national pride and human rights). The current government is based on enforcing the mass removal of emotion from the masses using a drug called Prozium, and is the source of the movie's main irony, that in order to eradicate war, it has waged war on all of it's own citizens, who constantly live under close surveillance. \n\nThe government employs Grammaton Clerics to handle that surveillance. They are highly trained officers authorized to kill anyone they deem to be "sense offenders" on the spot ("I trust you'll be more vigilant in the future?"). There is, in fact, a staggering amount of irony in the film, given that all emotion or feeling is strictly forbidden under penalty of death, and yet anger, suspicion and fear are all alive and well, and even flaunted. It's also interesting to consider that in real life it is the dogmatic, Cleric-like believers who aspire for war, and the normal people who just want to live their lives. \n\nFor the most part the movie ignores the fact that it is governments that wage war, not citizens (even emotionally sensitive ones), but no matter. The important thing that you need to know about the movie is that it goes way, way too far, and because of that, it's fun. I cheered out loud several times during the film because the gun fights, which are so unrealistic it's almost funny, are genuinely well-choreographed and exciting. If I may say so, this is what gun fights in hard core science fiction movies should look like.\n\nMany people criticize the movie for being unrealistic or too extreme, altogether forgetting what kind of movie they're watching in the first place. The movie is not about moral dilemmas, even though the main character suffers a tremendous one, it's a fast, gritty science fiction movie that makes no apologies, and owes none.
