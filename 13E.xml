The direction, though it moves slowly, is very good.\n\nBut what made this movie remarkable for me was the cinematography. The most striking scenes feature the blonde character walking along the shore against a relatively light-blue sea.

Oshima has long had a fascination with the dichotomies in Japanese culture (and frankly most cultures) between how behavior is proscribed and how the more primal, instinctual urges (mostly sex) always find their way to the surface in spite of those mores.  Oshima has also found a fascination in seeing how both Western and Eastern cultures have, at one time or another (or more than one), put strict moral taboos on homosexuality, adultery, and even on prostitution, but these strictures have never eliminated or even slowed down their existence.\n\n"Gohatto" takes us into a world 150 years ago where such things don't exist on the surface but are fully integrated into what is real life just beneath. Whether such subject matter, or exploring Eastern cultures, particularly interests you or not, if you're interested in being challenged by the art that you see, "Gohatto" (like Peter Greenaway's recent "The Pillow Book") is a must-see film.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":7474,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.9},"contentRating":"Unrated","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1999-12-18","keywords":"19th century,samurai,japan,rivalry,prostitute","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001429/","name":"Takeshi Kitano"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0559430/","name":"Ryûhei Matsuda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0847487/","name":"Shinji Takeda"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0651915/","name":"Nagisa Ôshima"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0088127/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007001/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0060607/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0793050/","name":"Ryôtarô Shiba"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0651915/","name":"Nagisa Ôshima"}],"duration":"PT1H40M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The ending scene is the most devastating thing I've seen in a movie this year.\n\nGrade: B+","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14022,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"MA-17","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2020-07-23","keywords":"pills,dog,teenage girl loses her hair,teenage girl wears a wig,hospital","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Babyteeth","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi678936601","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzM2ODA5ZDItMjJjMS00ZTYxLTk3ODItOTNiMGEwZGQ2NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzM2ODA5ZDItMjJjMS00ZTYxLTk3ODItOTNiMGEwZGQ2NzNiXkEyXkFqcGdeQVRoaXJkUGFydHlJbmdlc3Rpb25Xb3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 1","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7340546/","name":"Eliza Scanlen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9334013/","name":"Michelle Lotters","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3108675/","name":"Toby Wallace"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2221724/","name":"Shannon Murphy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0234956/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0658237/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017733/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1514808/","name":"Rita Kalnejais"],"duration":"PT1H58M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

This boisterous, big-hearted animated film is bursting with ideas and colour, stuffed to the brim with - one suspects - pretty much every idea that struck writer-director Jorge Gutierrez's fancy. Indeed, the final film plays very much like the charming but unpolished debut of a filmmaker who can't quite believe he was lucky enough to get the attention of producer Guillermo del Toro, and has no intention of wasting the opportunity in case it never comes around again. As a result, The Book Of Life practically trembles with too many ideas and influences, but remains so earnest and inventive that it's easy to forgive its predictable, overstuffed plot.\n\nIn a small Mexican town on the Day Of The Dead, we meet the protagonists of the story: steadfast, earnest Manolo (voiced by Diego Luna), who would rather strum a guitar than fight a bull in the tradition of his forefathers; brash, adventurous Joaquin (Channing Tatum), who becomes the town hero in trying to avenge the murder of his father by bandits; and spunky, intelligent Maria (Zoe Saldana), daughter of the mayor who inevitably wins the hearts of both young men. The stakes, however, are higher than they could ever imagine: the two godly rulers of the underworld, La Muerte (Kate del Castillo) and Xibalba (Ron Perlman), have gambled dominion over each other's lands on the outcome of the love triangle.\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that there's a lot going on in The Book Of Life. The film covers everything from a mystical medal that lends invulnerability to anyone who wears it, to a tantalising love-hate relationship between the two gods, while spiced up with musical interludes galore. (It's not often that the film's hero will pause to belt out a soul-searching rendition of Radiohead's Creep, but that kind of thing happens all the time in The Book Of Life.) Mix it all up with retellings of Mexican folklore, including visits to the joyously colourful Land of the Remembered and the ghostly grey Land of the Forgotten, and the film can be a somewhat frenetic viewing experience, to say the least.\n\nBut, for all that Gutierrez packs his film full of ideas and details, he also manages to make most of it work very well. The love triangle may be trite, but there's nevertheless enough heart and humour holding Manolo, Maria and Joaquin together. Manolo's relationships with his dad Carlos (Hector Elizondo) and his departed mom Carmen (Ana de la Reguera) are coloured in with surprising depth as well. It's also wonderful to see a love triangle centred around a girl who knows her own mind - and rest assured that Maria speaks it often enough to make a real impact.\n\nThe Book Of Life also doubles as a very welcome riot of imagination and tradition. Every frame of the film is beautifully and thoughtfully designed, down to the fact that Manolo seems to have been intricately crafted out of wood. Moreover, instead of shying away from its Mexican roots to increase its global marketability, the film firmly embraces them. This gives Gutierrez room to craft some delicately dark moments in a graveyard or two, reminding everyone that those who have died can still live as long as they're remembered by the ones who loved them. And yet, the film never descends into darkness, instead tapping into the giddying energy of a fiesta - most memorably in a journey through the Land of the Remembered - complete with heady bursts of colour and music.\n\nThere's no denying that Gutierrez's film can occasionally be too much to handle. It's loud and almost cheerfully silly, tossing pop songs and Mexican folklore into a mix that sometimes doesn't work. But, at its best, The Book Of Life is like a rambunctious puppy: messy, loud and insistent, but radiating so much life and charm that it becomes quite impossible to resist.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":68224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2014-10-15","keywords":"afterlife,mexico,death character,bullfight,serenade","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi840674329","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk0Mjg3ODI5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNzM1NTA0MjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Manolo, a young man who is torn between fulfilling the expectations of his family and following his heart, embarks on an adventure that spans three fantastical worlds where he must face his greatest fears.\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0526019/","name":"Diego Luna"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0757855/","name":"Zoe Saldana"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1475594/","name":"Channing Tatum"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1509613/","name":"Jorge R.

The film deserves high marks for enjoyability and for bringing back the charm of Hollywood's golden years.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":96301,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2000-01-07","keywords":"premarital sex,racism,female nudity,woman dies from abortion,sex scene","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Cider House Rules","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1741725209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVmNGIyOTktMTU4OS00YTM1LWE4OTAtMmRmNmYzNmY2YzlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZGVmNGIyOTktMTU4OS00YTM1LWE4OTAtMmRmNmYzNmY2YzlhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"CT #4","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001497/","name":"Tobey Maguire","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000234/","name":"Charlize Theron","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000323/","name":"Michael Caine"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002120/","name":"Lasse Hallström"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159642/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0022594/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0015134/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0410288/","name":"John Irving"],"duration":"PT2H6M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I stumbled across To End All Wars when it was shown recently on one of the Starz/Encore channels. At the end, I kept asking myself why I had never heard of it. The film is nowhere to be found in Roger Ebert's reviews or Leonard Maltin's annual guide, and yet I suspect that Ebert, at least, would rate this film very highly.\n\nI like films that are about something that is important, at least to me, and not just pure entertainment. Not that I don't enjoy a good action-adventure film or light comedy from time to time, but most of the time, I prefer to spend my time watching films that make me think and perhaps even ask questions of myself.\n\nTo End All Wars is one such film. The Bridge on the River Kwai, which deals with the same historical events, is not, despite its many strong points. In this respect, To End All Wars is the better film, and the one that I am more likely to watch frequently.\n\nDespite its title, the film is not really about war. What it is about is the efforts of a small group of men, and one man in particular, to maintain their faith, their sense of values, and their very sanity under horrible, murderous conditions that would drive most men to insanity or to become murderers themselves.\n\nThe film forces me to ask myself whether I could have done the same under those conditions. To be honest, I'm afraid to ask the question because I may not like the answer.\n\nAlthough the film depicts many horrible things, it is not a depressing film, at least for me. Rather, it's a positive, hopeful film, in the same way that Schindler's List is a positive, hopeful film. If one man, in the case of Schindler, or a small group of men, in the case of the ones in this film, can maintain their sanity, faith, and values in a world that has gone insane, then there is hope for mankind.\n\nAs for the references to their Christian faith, it is not laid on with a trowel, as it might be in a lesser film. It is simply there as an important part of their lives. Whether or not we share that faith is beside the point. What is important is that they shared it, and that faith helped them to survive.\n\nCould the director and the writers have made their points even more effectively? Probably. Would I have liked to have known more about the individual characters? Definitely. Would the film have benefited from a larger budget? Possibly.\n\nAll of these questions are moot, however. Every film deserves to be judged on its own terms, on the basis of what it is and not what it might have been. Not every film can be another Citizen Kane or Rules of the Game, nor should it be.\n\nTaken on its own merits, To End All Wars is an excellent film that I expect to watch many times and recommend to my family and friends as well. The fact that the film never got proper distribution, at least in the United States, and therefore never got the recognition that it deserves, shows just how shallow and superficial the Hollywood film industry has become. Thankfully it is available on DVD.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":10801,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","War"],"datePublished":"2001-09-02","keywords":"japanese prison camp,jungle,escape,tarsau burma,railway of death","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"To End All Wars","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2717319449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNmYmUyYjctNGRhNy00NmMzLWFlZWEtODhmNGY0MmM2M2Q4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWNmYmUyYjctNGRhNy00NmMzLWFlZWEtODhmNGY0MmM2M2Q4XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Freestyle Digital Media"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001015/","name":"Robert Carlyle"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000662/","name":"Kiefer Sutherland"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0573223/","name":"Ciarán McMenamin"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0192289/","name":"David L.

Siejący postrach na ulicach Londynu w okolicach Whitechapel Kuba Rozpruwacz inspirował i inspiruje do dziś wielu twórców.

And they do succeed in a spectacular fashion.\n\nIt starts as a spoiled child comedy and feels kinda innocent. The girls just put spider eggs in Sean's ear and put a pin in an apple he's supposed to eat. But then, well, everything goes sideways.

I have read comments from users saying that this movie "didn't seem real" or "wasn't believable". To you, I ask: What did you think you were watching? I saw this screening at the Newport Film Festival and thought it was amazing. Some movies (gasp) are out there to entertain and this does just that... fantastically. It is a story that laughs at the ups and downs of the human experience while portraying the sometimes very harsh reality of middle-class struggle. It gives us a story we recognize to a certain extent, but garnishes it with a great variety of endearing characters.

I have read comments from users saying that this movie "didn't seem real" or "wasn't believable". To you, I ask: What did you think you were watching? I saw this screening at the Newport Film Festival and thought it was amazing. Some movies (gasp) are out there to entertain and this does just that... fantastically. It is a story that laughs at the ups and downs of the human experience while portraying the sometimes very harsh reality of middle-class struggle. It gives us a story we recognize to a certain extent, but garnishes it with a great variety of endearing characters. As an example the group of "guys" has a wonderfully accepted gay guy who asked the guys to call him MOOSE.

Take it for a man trying to survive, not bringing down a whole army.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":239817,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"1982-10-22","keywords":"abuse of power,corrupt sheriff,veteran,corrupt cop,bad cop","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Rambo: First Blood","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1402863897","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JkY2FhOTgtODAzZi00YzUyLTk5ZWMtODZiNTM0YWI2MDhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BM2JkY2FhOTgtODAzZi00YzUyLTk5ZWMtODZiNTM0YWI2MDhlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Artisan","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001133/","name":"Brian Dennehy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001077/","name":"Richard Crenna"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0467646/","name":"Ted Kotcheff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0055376/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0779514/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0231747/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0606251/","name":"David Morrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0468997/","name":"Michael Kozoll","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0755266/","name":"William Sackheim"],"duration":"PT1H33M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The guy has been in every(I think) Highlander movie so far, despite the fact that only the first was particularly popular. He's done so many B-movies that one has to wonder if he is aware that the films are bad and doesn't care, or if he really doesn't realize their quality(or, rather, lack thereof). Here, he returns in a sequel to the fairly low-budget B-movie action-science fiction flick, Fortress. In the first one, the prison was huge, and underneath the ground. Here, it's... well, it's still huge, but this time, it's in outer space. I guess the writer thought, hey, the first time, it was underneath the ground... the only place that could be worse than that would be outer space. I hope he's right... I surely do, because if he is, maybe we won't see anymore half-cooked action-sci-fi flicks like this. Lambert portrays the exact same character, which I suppose is good, as he was a decent character in the first. A few somewhat big names also join the cast, most noticeably Pam Grier. The cast of characters from the first are pretty much remade(apart from Lambert himself), meaning that the new cast pretty much just fills the shoes of the characters from the first(anyone who knows how the first ended knows why). Unfortunately, that means that the film seems more like an overblown remake with the same guy portraying the lead, rather than a sequel. The hacker from the first(who was a neurotic, nervous guy, beautifully portrayed by great horror-talent, Jeffrey Combs) is replaced by an annoying black-guy stereotype. The female lead is replaced by a girl from the resistance(which Lambert's character is said to be a member of as well... odd... I don't remember that from the first... does that mean he joined the resistance after he got a kid? Who'd do that?), instead of his wife as it was in the first... apparently mainly because the scriptwriter couldn't find a good way to capture both Lambert and the wife-character, without capturing the kid. The Men-Tel prison commander(who was played by the cool bad-guy actor, Kurtwood Smith, from RoboCop fame) is now an annoying wimp with a ridiculous British accent that really gets on your nerves(as opposed to the cool Smith, who was a menacing and threatening presence). The plot is a rehash of the first. The pacing isn't particularly good. The very scenes in the movie seems to be(for the most part) remakes of the scenes of the original(talk about lack of originality...) and the action is mostly just rehashes of the first, just made a little less exciting(remember those way-cool machine guns with three barrels in the first? They're replaced with dull futuristic-looking stick-stun-guns). The special effects are decent at best. The script is a weak rehash of the first, with a few added sub-plots, none of which being particularly good... most of them are just there to keep the film going, or put it an action scene, in order to distract the audience from the poor writing. The dialog is pretty bad, with one or two exceptions. All in all, the film is just a tame rehash of everything the first was(which isn't even a lot). Somebody took the first film, said, "hey, this is popular... but it's not very good... how about if we try to do something of even lesser quality and see if people will like it?" Probably writer/producer/actor John Flock, who, going by the plot and the writing of this film, really is as dumb as he looks. I recommend this only to huge fans of the first Fortress, Lambert or B-movies. Everyone else; don't bother. There's a million better ways to spend 90 minutes, and there's at least as many reasons not to see this film. 5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6871,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2000-03-02","keywords":"punishment,dome,breasts,buttocks,female frontal nudity","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Fortress 2: Re-Entry","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1424294169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWZkNGZlZjAtZTE3Yi00OWZkLTgxNDYtMGZiN2I1NTI0YzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWZkNGZlZjAtZTE3Yi00OWZkLTgxNDYtMGZiN2I1NTI0YzdlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from TriStar Pictures"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000483/","name":"Christopher Lambert"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0869728/","name":"Beth Toussaint"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0308606/","name":"Willie Garson"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0614276/","name":"Geoff Murphy"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0048299/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0058145/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0080257/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0270686/","name":"Steven Feinberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0624639/","name":"Troy Neighbors"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0282472/","name":"John Flock"}],"duration":"PT1H32M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The guy has been in every(I think) Highlander movie so far, despite the fact that only the first was particularly popular. He's done so many B-movies that one has to wonder if he is aware that the films are bad and doesn't care, or if he really doesn't realize their quality(or, rather, lack thereof). Here, he returns in a sequel to the fairly low-budget B-movie action-science fiction flick, Fortress. In the first one, the prison was huge, and underneath the ground. Here, it's... well, it's still huge, but this time, it's in outer space. I guess the writer thought, hey, the first time, it was underneath the ground... the only place that could be worse than that would be outer space. I hope he's right... I surely do, because if he is, maybe we won't see anymore half-cooked action-sci-fi flicks like this. Lambert portrays the exact same character, which I suppose is good, as he was a decent character in the first. A few somewhat big names also join the cast, most noticeably Pam Grier. The cast of characters from the first are pretty much remade(apart from Lambert himself), meaning that the new cast pretty much just fills the shoes of the characters from the first(anyone who knows how the first ended knows why). Unfortunately, that means that the film seems more like an overblown remake with the same guy portraying the lead, rather than a sequel. The hacker from the first(who was a neurotic, nervous guy, beautifully portrayed by great horror-talent, Jeffrey Combs) is replaced by an annoying black-guy stereotype. The female lead is replaced by a girl from the resistance(which Lambert's character is said to be a member of as well... odd... I don't remember that from the first... does that mean he joined the resistance after he got a kid? Who'd do that?), instead of his wife as it was in the first... apparently mainly because the scriptwriter couldn't find a good way to capture both Lambert and the wife-character, without capturing the kid. The Men-Tel prison commander(who was played by the cool bad-guy actor, Kurtwood Smith, from RoboCop fame) is now an annoying wimp with a ridiculous British accent that really gets on your nerves(as opposed to the cool Smith, who was a menacing and threatening presence). The plot is a rehash of the first. The pacing isn't particularly good.

As it is, both shows are proving that there is an audience for historical dramas and I hope such endeavors continue in the future.\n\nThe Tudors has a quality cast with attractive actors for both genders to attach to.

I cannot make an honest opinion yet on the plots and direction of the series until I see more of it, but the imagery alone is a good start for this series.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":71645,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1,"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama","History","Romance"],"datePublished":"2007-04-01","keywords":"sex scene,king,royalty,king henry viii,english court","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001667/","name":"Jonathan Rhys Meyers","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0147147/","name":"Henry Cavill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0112390/","name":"Anthony Brophy"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078130/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052980/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0082215/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0386694/","name":"Michael Hirst"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Tudors: Season 4: The Final Season","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3776092441","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwY2E4Y2EtNmMyNy00MjFiLTg0ODgtNWVhMzhlYTQ0OTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgwY2E4Y2EtNmMyNy00MjFiLTg0ODgtNWVhMzhlYTQ0OTk0XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for The Tudors: The Final Season"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I think the most impressive thing about it was its commitment to building on the mythology set forth by the original. It managed to expand on the original and give us answers to what happened to characters after it in ways that felt clever, fresh, and still faithful to it. It manages to be about the continuation of certain events in the first film while creating a new fascinating character at its core and manages to tell the new character's arc brilliantly. To reiterate, it's very well written, managing to avoid the clichés that usually transpire in films like this. Villeneuve has quickly become one of the best filmmakers currently working and this is only another example of his talent. However, the original was much better.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":513093,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-10-05","keywords":"female nudity,environmental damage,corporatist,capitalism,sex scene","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"At Cinemas Now","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3362371865","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjY3MTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE0NjU3MzI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjY3MTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE0NjU3MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young blade runner's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0331516/","name":"Ryan Gosling"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1869101/","name":"Ana de Armas"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898288/","name":"Denis Villeneuve"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054452/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001799/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266684/","name":"Hampton Fancher"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001140/","name":"Philip K.

I think the most impressive thing about it was its commitment to building on the mythology set forth by the original. It managed to expand on the original and give us answers to what happened to characters after it in ways that felt clever, fresh, and still faithful to it. It manages to be about the continuation of certain events in the first film while creating a new fascinating character at its core and manages to tell the new character's arc brilliantly. To reiterate, it's very well written, managing to avoid the clichés that usually transpire in films like this. Villeneuve has quickly become one of the best filmmakers currently working and this is only another example of his talent. However, the original was much better.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":513093,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Mystery","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-10-05","keywords":"female nudity,environmental damage,corporatist,capitalism,sex scene","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"At Cinemas Now","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3362371865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjY3MTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE0NjU3MzI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE3MjY3MTkzNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTE0NjU3MzI@._V1_.jpg","description":"A young blade runner's discovery of a long-buried secret leads him to track down former blade runner Rick Deckard, who's been missing for thirty years.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000148/","name":"Harrison Ford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0331516/","name":"Ryan Gosling","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1869101/","name":"Ana de Armas"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0898288/","name":"Denis Villeneuve"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054452/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0001799/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0266684/","name":"Hampton Fancher","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001140/","name":"Philip K.

It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.\n\nI thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.\n\nBottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).\n\nIf you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-08-04","keywords":"gunslinger,based on novel,prophetic dream,another world,parallel dimension","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1690417433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, roams an Old West-like landscape where "the world has moved on" in pursuit of the man in black.

But on the whole, this is an over-the-top, pretentious dud, the sort of thing that should be seen only by the paid critics who then have a professional obligation and civic duty to spare all the rest of us such an irritating waste of our time.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":939,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"Not Rated","genre":["Drama","Romance","War"],"datePublished":"2003-10-17","keywords":"sex standing up,lift skirt,panties hit the floor,panties pulled down,fondling","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0538048/","name":"Krzysztof Majchrzak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0272295/","name":"Adam Ferency","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322937/","name":"Krzysztof Globisz"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0464383/","name":"Jan Jakub Kolski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043688/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0028557/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0090290/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0094194/","name":"Luc Bondy","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0102722/","name":"Gérard Brach","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0326822/","name":"Witold Gombrowicz"],"duration":"PT1H57M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It got a rave review in a Danish newspaper when it was doing the rounds here in March 2015, so my wife and I went to see it. Just beautifully filmed and acted - a very moving portrait of a people whom I knew nothing about previously. When I came out, I was on the verge of revising my choice of Fanny and Alexander as my favourite film; I was so in awe of what I had just seen. Sadly, Krzysztof Krauze, the co-director, died at Christmas 2014. I have been in touch with the Polish Film Institute to see if a DVD with English sub-titles is available, but it isn't yet, despite it being shown at the London Film Festival. Let's hope something is done about that - I'd buy several copies as gifts for friends. If you get a chance to see it, don't miss it. "Ida" deservedly got a lot of good reviews and even the Oscar for Best Foreign Film.

It got a rave review in a Danish newspaper when it was doing the rounds here in March 2015, so my wife and I went to see it. Just beautifully filmed and acted - a very moving portrait of a people whom I knew nothing about previously. When I came out, I was on the verge of revising my choice of Fanny and Alexander as my favourite film; I was so in awe of what I had just seen. Sadly, Krzysztof Krauze, the co-director, died at Christmas 2014. I have been in touch with the Polish Film Institute to see if a DVD with English sub-titles is available, but it isn't yet, despite it being shown at the London Film Festival. Let's hope something is done about that - I'd buy several copies as gifts for friends. If you get a chance to see it, don't miss it. "Ida" deservedly got a lot of good reviews and even the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. This one is much better.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"contentRating":"G","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2013-11-15","keywords":"character name as title,nickname as title,papusza character,poetess,title directed by female","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0591858/","name":"Jowita Budnik","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1138580/","name":"Zbigniew Walerys","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2252397/","name":"Antoni Pawlicki"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1732806/","name":"Joanna Kos-Krauze","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470377/","name":"Krzysztof Krauze"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0330220/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043688/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049230/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1732806/","name":"Joanna Kos-Krauze","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0470377/","name":"Krzysztof Krauze"],"duration":"PT2H11M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Występ, który odbył się w czasie pandemii, musiał mieć dość kameralny charakter, ale mimo to muzycy przygotowali spektakularny show. Udowodnili, że wbrew niełatwym okolicznościom granie muzyki na żywo wciąż ma wielki sens.</desc>

Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing.

You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment.

The search has elemental film roots with mental and physical violence enhanced by Leslie Manville as a bad grandma and her wicked sons.\n\nIt's fun to see the bad guys get roughed up. It's also satisfying to see the searching-for-family motif of contemporary super-hero films played out in the Western plains even if it was filmed in Calgary. The craggy mountains and little towns complement the late fifties setting when love and crime occur in simple but stark ways.\n\nRetired Montana Sheriff George (Kevin Costner) and his wife, Margaret (Diane Lane), search for their grandson, Jimmy (Bram Hornung and Otto Hornung) after the death of their son, James (Ryan Bruce). Former daughter in law Lorna (Kavli Carter) has left abruptly with new husband, Donny Weboy (Will Britain), and grandson, relocating under duress to North Dakota and his family- Weboy territory where matriarch Blanche (Manville) wields absolute power. Very bad move. The chase begins.\n\nLane and Costner are in top-aging form, tough and tenderhearted enough to fight the Weboy clan for the grandson. This is a different, more nuanced role for them when they were Superman's parents. Let Him Go adds an authenticity to the thriller formula by emphasizing the devotion of the loving couple to each other and their quest to keep the family whole, or at least provide a fitting family life for their grandson.\n\nThe usual Western tropes apply like the corrupt sheriff, bad grandma and sons, the kind stranger, the tough mother, and the epic ending battle. What goes beyond the formula is the sincere love propelling the plot and corralling our hearts. And, of course, the fully-seasoned Lane and Costner.\n\nLet Him Go is much more than the genre it represents."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21706,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-11-06","keywords":"based on novel,husband wife relationship,grief,final battle,final showdown","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi876658201","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBmMGExZjQtYTFmMy00NTc1LThhNWEtZWRmMzI4ZTk4ZGY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBmMGExZjQtYTFmMy00NTc1LThhNWEtZWRmMzI4ZTk4ZGY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Following the loss of their son, retired sheriff George Blackledge (Costner) and his wife Margaret (Lane) leave their Montana ranch to rescue their young grandson from the clutches of a dangerous family living off the grid in the Dakotas, headed by matriarch Blanche Weboy.

The craggy mountains and little towns complement the late fifties setting when love and crime occur in simple but stark ways.\n\nRetired Montana Sheriff George (Kevin Costner) and his wife, Margaret (Diane Lane), search for their grandson, Jimmy (Bram Hornung and Otto Hornung) after the death of their son, James (Ryan Bruce). Former daughter in law Lorna (Kavli Carter) has left abruptly with new husband, Donny Weboy (Will Britain), and grandson, relocating under duress to North Dakota and his family- Weboy territory where matriarch Blanche (Manville) wields absolute power. Very bad move. The chase begins.\n\nLane and Costner are in top-aging form, tough and tenderhearted enough to fight the Weboy clan for the grandson. This is a different, more nuanced role for them when they were Superman's parents. Let Him Go adds an authenticity to the thriller formula by emphasizing the devotion of the loving couple to each other and their quest to keep the family whole, or at least provide a fitting family life for their grandson.\n\nThe usual Western tropes apply like the corrupt sheriff, bad grandma and sons, the kind stranger, the tough mother, and the epic ending battle. What goes beyond the formula is the sincere love propelling the plot and corralling our hearts. And, of course, the fully-seasoned Lane and Costner.\n\nLet Him Go is much more than the genre it represents.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":21706,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-11-06","keywords":"based on novel,husband wife relationship,grief,final battle,final showdown","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi876658201","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBmMGExZjQtYTFmMy00NTc1LThhNWEtZWRmMzI4ZTk4ZGY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzBmMGExZjQtYTFmMy00NTc1LThhNWEtZWRmMzI4ZTk4ZGY1XkEyXkFqcGdeQXNuZXNodQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Following the loss of their son, retired sheriff George Blackledge (Costner) and his wife Margaret (Lane) leave their Montana ranch to rescue their young grandson from the clutches of a dangerous family living off the grid in the Dakotas, headed by matriarch Blanche Weboy.

A young Polish boy, Stefek, is determined to find his father, whom he has never met. He has an active imagination and tries various 'tricks' to succeed. He believes in a chain of events, and that one thing will lead to the next, and that he can induce or 'bribe' fate to do what he wants. In this case to find his father. And Stefek is not one to give up lightly.\n\nThe backdrop is a small Polish village, where we witness a slice of small town life, where much activity is focused on the railway line that crosses the town.\n\nHis sister Elka is trying to find a better job, but also has to look after the boy while their mother works in a shop, and even when Elka is with her boyfriend.

A young Polish boy, Stefek, is determined to find his father, whom he has never met. He has an active imagination and tries various 'tricks' to succeed. He believes in a chain of events, and that one thing will lead to the next, and that he can induce or 'bribe' fate to do what he wants. In this case to find his father. And Stefek is not one to give up lightly.\n\nThe backdrop is a small Polish village, where we witness a slice of small town life, where much activity is focused on the railway line that crosses the town.\n\nHis sister Elka is trying to find a better job, but also has to look after the boy while their mother works in a shop, and even when Elka is with her boyfriend. We meet several other colourful characters in town as young Stefek continues his quest.\n\nIt is the subtleties, the understatements that make this film so special: Stefek hesitating before answering questions, the 'tricks' he plays with coins and toy soldiers, the way how he attempts to discover the combination of factors that makes his neighbour's pigeons fly their coop.

A Security Service Major wishes to "buy" gullible priest Zieja and turn him into an agent who will discredit the opposition. The priest's interrogations become a natural pretext for a journey through the history of Poland in the twentieth century: from the Bolshevik war of 1920, through World War II, up to modern times. It turns out that the seemingly naive Father Zieja is actually a clever rebel. The world he lived in was unacceptable to him. He was ahead of his time. A lonely journey without a passport to Rome in the 1930s turned into thoughts of a European Union. Performing the Catholic funeral rites of a woman who committed suicide (during the 20s of the past century) was an protest against the church's rules. Proclaiming the slogan "never kill anyone, not even your enemies" during the Second World War, was against patriotic mythologies and foretold future pacifist attitudes. Zieja puts his life and freedom on the line in the name of moral, ethical and religious values in which he believed. The film "Zieja" is rooted in the movement of Polish Catholicism, which is based on high ethical standards, poverty and tolerance, as well as respect and love for other human beings." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;{"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt10136434/","name":"Zieja","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzcyMDNiZDctYjg3OS00OTU2LWE2ZGMtZThjZmM0YmI3NjQ2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMTEwMTY3NDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The 70s.

I like the film with Gwyneth Paltrow, and absolutely love the BBC miniseries, so I was cautious watching this, especially with the several bad reviews. I don't know if it was because I went in with low expectations, but I was delighted by this movie! Admittedly if you don't know the story, it can move fast, but to be fair, the book is long and tedious, with a lot to fit in two hours, which is one of my problems with the 2008 movie. The visuals and fashions of this movie are beautiful, and Emma's character did show improvement unlike some of the comments I saw.

I like the film with Gwyneth Paltrow, and absolutely love the BBC miniseries, so I was cautious watching this, especially with the several bad reviews. I don't know if it was because I went in with low expectations, but I was delighted by this movie! Admittedly if you don't know the story, it can move fast, but to be fair, the book is long and tedious, with a lot to fit in two hours, which is one of my problems with the 2008 movie. The visuals and fashions of this movie are beautiful, and Emma's character did show improvement unlike some of the comments I saw. This one definitely captured Jane Austen's humor, and you can be guaranteed to laugh a few times. The BBC mini-series is still my top rated, but the 2020 "Emma." is, in my opinion, a notch above the 2008 "Emma", but would definitely recommend all adaptations, especially the book.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":42859,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2020-02-14","keywords":"nineteenth century,female protagonist,declaration of love,based on novel,horse and carriage","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2031927065","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2EwMTFjMmYtY2Q5OS00Njc3LTkzMzgtMWU1Y2M3YzM1NWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BY2EwMTFjMmYtY2Q5OS00Njc3LTkzMzgtMWU1Y2M3YzM1NWFjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Handsome, clever, and rich, Emma Woodhouse is a restless queen bee without rivals in her sleepy little town.

We'll for me it didn't.\n\nFor those looking for a hard-hitting insight into how and why the Russians attempted what they did or why the suspects have never been charged then go watch the news specials that came out at the time. But for a view of how the real people at the heart of this whole affair were really affected then the writers, directors and actors have done a good job.\n\nYes, it is low key in its look and feel. Yes, there are a lot of people who know Salisbury thinking 'that's not somewhere I recognise'; the use of locations from other cathedral cities threw me off the narrative a couple of times wondering where the characters were meant to be. But most importantly it drew me in to understanding more of how just frightening the possible outcome of not having an early intervention could have been and the emotional strain on those key families.\n\nFor you 1 star reviewers I say your expectations were skewed from the start. It was good to see what felt like a truthful docu-drama.\n\nAnd as my son said at the end of part 3, 'well, that was emotional.'","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4401,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-06-14","keywords":"poisoning,salisbury wiltshire,year 2018,nerve agent,british police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1245863/","name":"Rafe Spall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240359/","name":"Anne-Marie Duff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2118257/","name":"Annabel Scholey"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0645108/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2779562265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNlNGI3NzMtZDRkMC00MjdkLTgwYTUtY2ViZDcwYjJlMDJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNlNGI3NzMtZDRkMC00MjdkLTgwYTUtY2ViZDcwYjJlMDJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In March 2018, the eyes of the world turned to the British city of Salisbury when it became the epicenter of what has been described as one of the biggest political events of the 21st century -- but until now, the heroic acts behind the headlines have not been told. Within three days of the assassination attempt on double agent and spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, key agencies discovered that a lethal nerve agent called Novichok was used, just half a teaspoon of which could kill 20,000 people. Within four days, hundreds of traces were found across the city, and, just when things were finally thought to be under control, a perfume bottle containing the nerve agent was discovered, throwing the investigation into renewed chaos."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

That it would rake over old coals and put our city once again in a bad light. We'll for me it didn't.\n\nFor those looking for a hard-hitting insight into how and why the Russians attempted what they did or why the suspects have never been charged then go watch the news specials that came out at the time. But for a view of how the real people at the heart of this whole affair were really affected then the writers, directors and actors have done a good job.\n\nYes, it is low key in its look and feel.

It was good to see what felt like a truthful docu-drama.\n\nAnd as my son said at the end of part 3, 'well, that was emotional.'","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":4401,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"TV-14","genre":["Drama","History","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-06-14","keywords":"poisoning,salisbury wiltshire,year 2018,nerve agent,british police","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1245863/","name":"Rafe Spall","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0240359/","name":"Anne-Marie Duff","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2118257/","name":"Annabel Scholey"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0645108/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"],"trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2779562265","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNlNGI3NzMtZDRkMC00MjdkLTgwYTUtY2ViZDcwYjJlMDJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYzNlNGI3NzMtZDRkMC00MjdkLTgwYTUtY2ViZDcwYjJlMDJhXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"In March 2018, the eyes of the world turned to the British city of Salisbury when it became the epicenter of what has been described as one of the biggest political events of the 21st century -- but until now, the heroic acts behind the headlines have not been told. Within three days of the assassination attempt on double agent and spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia, key agencies discovered that a lethal nerve agent called Novichok was used, just half a teaspoon of which could kill 20,000 people. Within four days, hundreds of traces were found across the city, and, just when things were finally thought to be under control, a perfume bottle containing the nerve agent was discovered, throwing the investigation into renewed chaos."&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is not a nature drama though it shows the splendid colours and customs of the countryside. It is not a musical though Lubica expresses her longing in a passionate dance. Nor is it a film about ghosts though a ghost does ask the hero for a favour. A few draughts of Strawberry Wine are enough to take us into a magical world in the true centre of Europe, where love, crime and penitence are just as much a part of life as the changing of the seasons, the migration of birds or the flowing of a mountain stream." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1260596/","name":"Wino truskawkowe","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOTI5MjU4YjUtNGJkNy00Nzk2LTgyYWEtMDk0OTBmY2NmZTYyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTgyNDg0NTY@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is not a love story though it is full of love.

However, I was very pleasantly surprised by Alfonso Cuarón's which is an enchanting cinematic experience. It's visually mesmerizing thanks to the amazing sets and art direction and perhaps mostly to the stunning cinematography. Cuarón certainly has an eye for visuals and in my opinion, this is one of the finest examples of first-rate cinematography. I was especially drawn by the long shots.\n\nThen there's the wonderful soundtrack which contributes beautifully to the lyrical flow and the surreal feel the film creates. The sound effects and lighting are on par.\n\nIn addition, the dialogues are eloquently written. A lot is said with a few words and the few words that are spoken are poetry. The pacing is smooth. There is not a single boring moment.\n\n'Great Expectations' reminds me that Ethan Hawk is one of the finest actors today and unlike many of his contemporaries, he manages to keep a low profile and let his work speak. His performance is transcendent, unaffected by the visuals. Chris Cooper is equally good good as Fin's guardian who loves him no matter what. Gwyneth Paltrow looks alluring (albeit a little too thin). Anne Bancroft is haunting. Robert de Niro is awesome.\n\nI didn't know that Cuaron was the director and I wasn't expecting much from a cinematic adaptation of a Dickens novel but I got far more than what I has expected. It's been a while since a film has so wholly engaged and involved me."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52767,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-01-30","keywords":"estella character,whiskey,cigarette,love,gulf coast","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Great Expectations (1998)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi715850009","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFmY2UxMDktNTZkYi00MGQ3LTk2Y2QtZDdlN2FmMTZjM2JlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFmY2UxMDktNTZkYi00MGQ3LTk2Y2QtZDdlN2FmMTZjM2JlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000569/","name":"Gwyneth Paltrow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000279/","name":"Hank Azaria"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079747/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002042/","name":"Charles Dickens"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322248/","name":"Mitch Glazer"}],"duration":"PT1H51M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

However, I was very pleasantly surprised by Alfonso Cuarón's which is an enchanting cinematic experience. It's visually mesmerizing thanks to the amazing sets and art direction and perhaps mostly to the stunning cinematography. Cuarón certainly has an eye for visuals and in my opinion, this is one of the finest examples of first-rate cinematography. I was especially drawn by the long shots.\n\nThen there's the wonderful soundtrack which contributes beautifully to the lyrical flow and the surreal feel the film creates. The sound effects and lighting are on par.\n\nIn addition, the dialogues are eloquently written. A lot is said with a few words and the few words that are spoken are poetry. The pacing is smooth. There is not a single boring moment.\n\n'Great Expectations' reminds me that Ethan Hawk is one of the finest actors today and unlike many of his contemporaries, he manages to keep a low profile and let his work speak. His performance is transcendent, unaffected by the visuals. Chris Cooper is equally good good as Fin's guardian who loves him no matter what. Gwyneth Paltrow looks alluring (albeit a little too thin). Anne Bancroft is haunting. Robert de Niro is awesome.\n\nI didn't know that Cuaron was the director and I wasn't expecting much from a cinematic adaptation of a Dickens novel but I got far more than what I has expected. It's been a while since a film has so wholly engaged and involved me.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":52767,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1998-01-30","keywords":"estella character,whiskey,cigarette,love,gulf coast","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Great Expectations (1998)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi715850009","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFmY2UxMDktNTZkYi00MGQ3LTk2Y2QtZDdlN2FmMTZjM2JlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTFmY2UxMDktNTZkYi00MGQ3LTk2Y2QtZDdlN2FmMTZjM2JlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Theatrical Trailer from 20th Century Fox","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000569/","name":"Gwyneth Paltrow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000279/","name":"Hank Azaria"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0079747/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0002042/","name":"Charles Dickens","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322248/","name":"Mitch Glazer"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

If this is the one wide release horror film we get for Halloween, it does serve its purpose well enough.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":11086,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2020-10-30","keywords":"based on short film,cell phone,monster,parking lot,seperated parents","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Now Playing","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2498674969","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3ZThhYzgtMWMyZS00Nzg5LWE0MTctZjAzYjM0YmE1NDZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzI3ZThhYzgtMWMyZS00Nzg5LWE0MTctZjAzYjM0YmE1NDZiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":"A monster named Larry that manifests itself through smart phones and mobile devices.

A young Polish boy, Stefek, is determined to find his father, whom he has never met. He has an active imagination and tries various 'tricks' to succeed. He believes in a chain of events, and that one thing will lead to the next, and that he can induce or 'bribe' fate to do what he wants. In this case to find his father. And Stefek is not one to give up lightly.\n\nThe backdrop is a small Polish village, where we witness a slice of small town life, where much activity is focused on the railway line that crosses the town.\n\nHis sister Elka is trying to find a better job, but also has to look after the boy while their mother works in a shop, and even when Elka is with her boyfriend. We meet several other colourful characters in town as young Stefek continues his quest.\n\nIt is the subtleties, the understatements that make this film so special: Stefek hesitating before answering questions, the 'tricks' he plays with coins and toy soldiers, the way how he attempts to discover the combination of factors that makes his neighbour's pigeons fly their coop. Director Jakimowski did an outstanding job.\n\nTechnically too this is an excellent film; the richly-hued cinematography by Adam Bajerski and soundtrack by Tomasz Gassowski in particular are outstanding. And then the acting by the non- professional cast; the boy Stefek played by Damian Ul, is a true natural and gave a magic performance, and so too his sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak). \n\nI am looking forward watching this gem of a film again. 8/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2071,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7},"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"watermelon,waitress,toy soldier,sunbathing,polish family","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761542/","name":"Damian Ul"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761555/","name":"Ewelina Walendziak"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0764671/","name":"Tomasz Sapryk"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0235898/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

A young Polish boy, Stefek, is determined to find his father, whom he has never met. He has an active imagination and tries various 'tricks' to succeed. He believes in a chain of events, and that one thing will lead to the next, and that he can induce or 'bribe' fate to do what he wants. In this case to find his father. And Stefek is not one to give up lightly.\n\nThe backdrop is a small Polish village, where we witness a slice of small town life, where much activity is focused on the railway line that crosses the town.\n\nHis sister Elka is trying to find a better job, but also has to look after the boy while their mother works in a shop, and even when Elka is with her boyfriend. We meet several other colourful characters in town as young Stefek continues his quest.\n\nIt is the subtleties, the understatements that make this film so special: Stefek hesitating before answering questions, the 'tricks' he plays with coins and toy soldiers, the way how he attempts to discover the combination of factors that makes his neighbour's pigeons fly their coop. Director Jakimowski did an outstanding job.\n\nTechnically too this is an excellent film; the richly-hued cinematography by Adam Bajerski and soundtrack by Tomasz Gassowski in particular are outstanding. And then the acting by the non- professional cast; the boy Stefek played by Damian Ul, is a true natural and gave a magic performance, and so too his sister Elka (Ewelina Walendziak). \n\nI am looking forward watching this gem of a film again. 8/10.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":2071,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7,"genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2007-10-26","keywords":"watermelon,waitress,toy soldier,sunbathing,polish family","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761542/","name":"Damian Ul","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2761555/","name":"Ewelina Walendziak","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0764671/","name":"Tomasz Sapryk"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0076604/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0235898/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054609/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1435889/","name":"Andrzej Jakimowski"],"duration":"PT1H35M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They have each impressed in their own way prior to Fantastic Four but every single one of them has the range of the cast in Tim Story's Fantastic Four films and waste their talents in Trank's reboot.\n\nFantastic Four is a film very much out of time and place in today's market of superhero movies. Ten or fifteen years ago a studio might have been able to get away with it but not today. Audiences like to be entertained and with the competition offering much more excitement, I don't see audiences taking to this, at all.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":159504,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-08-05","keywords":"troubled production,marvel comics,fantastic four,invisibility,superhero team","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Theatrical Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3166483225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczNDc3OTkxMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTY5ODUyNjE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Four young outsiders teleport to an alternate and dangerous universe which alters their physical form in shocking ways.

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment.

    <title lang="en">One of a Kind Love</title>
    <desc lang="pl">One of a Kind Love: Directed by Philippe Lupien. With Jocelyn Hudon, Jake Manley, Daniela Sandiford, Raphael Grosz-Harvey. Kyra's dreams of being a jeweler have been put on the backburner, as her demanding job at the Sawyer Country Club is her priority. When a vacant shop becomes available in town, Kyra sees an opportunity to put a plan into action, until she learns that there's another renter interested in the space.

Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. "It was so great," she said. "You really felt like you were on the ship." "Nonsense," I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, "you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested." "Well, maybe," thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. "OK," I thought, "I'll give it a look see." I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.\n\nWhere to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost "you are there" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect "t" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of "My Heart Goes On."\n\nProblems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. \n\nA minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1103104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"keywords":"iceberg,sailor's death,love affair,mass death,sunken ship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"3D Release","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi907189785","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzczNjA2MTY5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyNDY2NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzczNjA2MTY5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyNDY2NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the new trailer for James Cameron's Academy Award winning blockbuster, coming to theaters in 3D.

I really thought the guy did a great job. The Living Daylights was an excellent Bond thriller, more in line with Dr No and From Russia With Love in tone and style, but with Licence To Kill you can tell that Broccoli decided to compete with the big boys with this action packed spectacular that aims high and scores. What we have here is Bond with spectacular action scenes and a more nastier steak with regards to the violence that is  more in line with Hollywood action blockbusters than with quintessential British spies. This is why the film works. Licence To Kill is much more darker than any of the Bond films that has come before, and after the silliness of the Moore era, that was what  this franchise needed. Why have world domination craving villains when you can just p*ss Bond off, big time. Having Felix Lieter maimed and his wife killed on their wedding day is inspired and immediately puts the film on a darker streak. The script here is very strong as we watch a darker more violent Bond infiltrate the bad guy's lifestyle and then proceed to work from there.\n\n Don't make any mistakes this is not a Bond film that would be broadcast during a Bank Holiday afternoon. What we have here is a film that is graphically violent. Check out the head explosion scene or the nasty incidents involving sharks. Having Bond on the revenge path makes for a more interesting tale than just another villain trying to take over the world. The more personal element fits in with this more darker Bond. Dalton really rises to the occasion here and ensures that he will be remembered as a fine actor who played the part of James Bond. The ice cool look of anger as he dumps a bad guy into a shark tank with a case fool of money is fantastic as is his reaction to finding Lieter's dead wife. It may not be said, buy OHMSS is being referenced. Helping Dalton along the way is a great support cast. Robert Davi is superb as Franz Sanchez, without doubt the nastiest Bond villain there has ever been. We have two Bond girls too. Talisa Soto is beautifully sultry, but Carey Lowell just pips her to the post as Pam Bouvier who really gives Bond a run for his money. Another great casting point is an increased role for Q. Desmond Lewellyn appears here more than he ever has done before, helping out in the mission that makes one wonder the Bond writers never thought of it before, or why they never did it after.\n\nLicence To Kill is classic Bond. Purists may give of with the more American touch to the narrative (you just know that any theatrical trailer is crying out for voice over man to go "this time it's personal"), but the more darker narrative suits the film and it shows that Dalton was a good Bond no matter what his critics say. With some of the most spectacular action sequences at the time, this is a genuine Bond classic.\n\nShaken and stirred most definitely.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":100484,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1989-07-14","keywords":"personal vendetta,vengeance,drug cartel,official james bond series,felix leiter character","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Licence to Kill","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2476317465","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmFmMWVlNmEtZTQ5Zi00ZTBmLWFlMTgtZWQwODg1NTI1OWYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmFmMWVlNmEtZTQ5Zi00ZTBmLWFlMTgtZWQwODg1NTI1OWYxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer 2 for Licence To Kill"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001096/","name":"Timothy Dalton"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001108/","name":"Robert Davi"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000508/","name":"Carey Lowell"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0322515/","name":"John Glen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0024134/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0054040/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0026841/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933865/","name":"Michael G.

Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. "It was so great," she said. "You really felt like you were on the ship." "Nonsense," I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, "you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested." "Well, maybe," thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. "OK," I thought, "I'll give it a look see." I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.\n\nWhere to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost "you are there" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect "t" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of "My Heart Goes On."\n\nProblems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. \n\nA minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.\n\n9/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1103104,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"keywords":"iceberg,sailor's death,love affair,mass death,sunken ship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"3D Release","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi907189785","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzczNjA2MTY5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyNDY2NzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzczNjA2MTY5M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTgyNDY2NzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the new trailer for James Cameron's Academy Award winning blockbuster, coming to theaters in 3D.

What's the point in saying beforehands that the boy punishes the girl for saying bad things about his dead father, while in the film we discover that almost in the end? For about 70 minutes the only thing you know is that the boy did something very bad to the girl, but we still don't know why, until we see his last flashback, which kind of explains his behaviour. If you know that already, then you've got nothing to wait for.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":406,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-11-04","keywords":"boy","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11075664/","name":"Damir Onackis","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11075665/","name":"Luize Birkenberga","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0904474/","name":"Indra Burkovska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1797523/","name":"Dace Puce"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0616930/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11069042/","name":"Jana Egle","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9413330/","name":"Monta Gagane","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1797523/","name":"Dace Puce"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Leonardo DiCaprio made Gatsby his own ("Old spor'!") while retaining a feeling of familiarity. The screenplay was a faithful adaptation and even helped me understand some of the novel's themes more clearly. And though you'd think hearing dubstep during the Jazz Age would be jarring, the soundtrack worked very well.\n\nBut I couldn't love it. And it's (mostly) Tobey Maguire's fault.\n\nGatsby loomed so large in the original story that it's not hard to forget all about Nick. But it can be argued, and often is, that it was Nick and not Gatsby who was the protagonist of the novel. Fitgerald's story, told from Nick's first-person point of view, was only as good as Nick's narration; Gatsby was only so great because Nick viewed him that way.\n\nUnfortunately, Maguire fell completely flat in his role as narrative guide. There was always so much else going on and so much of Luhrmann's dreamscape to absorb that Maguire seemed to get lost in it all. And — with him — so did the viewer. Without a strong presence from Maguire, Nick was relegated from having a role as interpreter of events to being just another character (and a rather unimportant one at that).\n\nLuhrmann tried to maintain Nick's narrative frame by having him tell the story — first as a patient speaking to his doctor at a sanitarium, then as a writer trying to explain his grief through prose. But those scenes came across (at best) as heavy-handed expository or (at worst) as Maguire's uninspired take on an abridged audiobook version of "The Great Gatsby."\n\nI wanted to love this film. I really did. It had so many wonderful qualities. But with no Nick (only a Tobey) to help make sense of the people and events, "angry, and half in love with {it}, and tremendously sorry, I turned away."","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":508080,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-05-15","keywords":"extramarital affair,obsessive love,party,fatal accident,1920s","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2949817881","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1ODU0Njg4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY2MTYzOQ@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1ODU0Njg4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY2MTYzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Midwestern war veteran finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor.

Leonardo DiCaprio made Gatsby his own ("Old spor'!") while retaining a feeling of familiarity. The screenplay was a faithful adaptation and even helped me understand some of the novel's themes more clearly. And though you'd think hearing dubstep during the Jazz Age would be jarring, the soundtrack worked very well.\n\nBut I couldn't love it. And it's (mostly) Tobey Maguire's fault.\n\nGatsby loomed so large in the original story that it's not hard to forget all about Nick. But it can be argued, and often is, that it was Nick and not Gatsby who was the protagonist of the novel. Fitgerald's story, told from Nick's first-person point of view, was only as good as Nick's narration; Gatsby was only so great because Nick viewed him that way.\n\nUnfortunately, Maguire fell completely flat in his role as narrative guide. There was always so much else going on and so much of Luhrmann's dreamscape to absorb that Maguire seemed to get lost in it all. And — with him — so did the viewer. Without a strong presence from Maguire, Nick was relegated from having a role as interpreter of events to being just another character (and a rather unimportant one at that).\n\nLuhrmann tried to maintain Nick's narrative frame by having him tell the story — first as a patient speaking to his doctor at a sanitarium, then as a writer trying to explain his grief through prose. But those scenes came across (at best) as heavy-handed expository or (at worst) as Maguire's uninspired take on an abridged audiobook version of "The Great Gatsby."\n\nI wanted to love this film. I really did. It had so many wonderful qualities. But with no Nick (only a Tobey) to help make sense of the people and events, "angry, and half in love with it, and tremendously sorry, I turned away."","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":508080,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.2,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-05-15","keywords":"extramarital affair,obsessive love,party,fatal accident,1920s","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Version #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2949817881","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1ODU0Njg4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY2MTYzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTk1ODU0Njg4NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY2MTYzOQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A Midwestern war veteran finds himself drawn to the past and lifestyle of his millionaire neighbor.

A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!---------------------------------\n\n************May Contain a Couple MINOR Spoilers************** The TV promo trailer for "The Weather Man" did nothing to capture my interest. It looked like another of those "Light" comedies, which usually just aren't that good. Via recommendations from a few of my students, I decided to check it out. Wow!..Sometimes Hollywood marketing teams are so utterly clueless! In this case, the trailer shown on TV and the film projected in the theater had absolutely nothing in common with one another!\n\nDirector Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ring) has given us a film that at first glance seems simple enough, but which ends up being as absolutely unpredictable as the science of meteorology itself. David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced meteorologist who has attained considerable success on a professional level, but whose personal life, despite his perpetual fantasies to the contrary, is an explosive and unmitigated disaster.\n\nAs the perturbed and ever-reflexive protagonist, Nicolas Cage (National Treasure, Lord of War) positions himself in the eye of his own tormented life, and is likewise the title character of the film. Like almost every other human being, Spritz is unable to come to grips with the stark reality that the dark clouds constantly present in his life are creations of his own device. They are clearly the consequence of his own actions and his particularly obstinate way of being and not merely products of some uncontrollable, mystical fate.\n\nWhile growing up, young David always loomed in the shadow of his famous Pulitzer-Prize winning father, Robert Spritz, played masterfully by Michael Caine. It seems that communication between father and son was never really what it should have been.

A. CA; CALI, COLOMBIA+ORLANDO, FL The ONLY Tony Kiss Castillo on FaceBook!---------------------------------\n\n************May Contain a Couple MINOR Spoilers************** The TV promo trailer for "The Weather Man" did nothing to capture my interest. It looked like another of those "Light" comedies, which usually just aren't that good. Via recommendations from a few of my students, I decided to check it out. Wow!..Sometimes Hollywood marketing teams are so utterly clueless! In this case, the trailer shown on TV and the film projected in the theater had absolutely nothing in common with one another!\n\nDirector Gore Verbinski (Pirates of the Caribbean, The Ring) has given us a film that at first glance seems simple enough, but which ends up being as absolutely unpredictable as the science of meteorology itself. David Spritz (Nicolas Cage) is a divorced meteorologist who has attained considerable success on a professional level, but whose personal life, despite his perpetual fantasies to the contrary, is an explosive and unmitigated disaster.\n\nAs the perturbed and ever-reflexive protagonist, Nicolas Cage (National Treasure, Lord of War) positions himself in the eye of his own tormented life, and is likewise the title character of the film. Like almost every other human being, Spritz is unable to come to grips with the stark reality that the dark clouds constantly present in his life are creations of his own device. They are clearly the consequence of his own actions and his particularly obstinate way of being and not merely products of some uncontrollable, mystical fate.\n\nWhile growing up, young David always loomed in the shadow of his famous Pulitzer-Prize winning father, Robert Spritz, played masterfully by Michael Caine. It seems that communication between father and son was never really what it should have been. Similarly, David leaves a lot to be desired in the area of warm and communicative interaction with all the important people in his life: His son, daughter, and of course, his ex- wife. David's disconnect is that he fantasizes that love and affection from his loved ones is linked directly to his level of professional success and recognition.\n\nThe Weather Man, despite being a great European style film, suffers from some excesses. In order to drive home the fact that David often walks rather aimlessly through life, it isn't indispensable to permit the film to meander and lose its focus for a few minutes as well!

The form of racism the Iraqis have to experience also ranges from the direct violence to much more casual ones from the local English who fail to recognize their love interests are more than what they see present in London - they are also their past, their culture and community.

He works as a parking lot attendant in New York, and is content to sit in his booth at night writing down passionate, articulate rants, so that when he goes home he can call a local radio sports show and prove his fanaticism for the Giants, his favorite football team.\n\nPaul is played by Patton Oswalt, one of the funniest stand-up comedians alive, and what he does in this film is really quite remarkable. He creates a fully convincing and pathetic loser, and is unafraid to reveal all the character's lowest points. If this were an Adam Sandler comedy we'd probably have scenes showing us how misunderstood and sweet Paul is, so we can understand that he's the one we're meant to root for, but Oswalt's Paul isn't so cleancut. He treats his family like crap and has terrible mood swings; he only seems truly happy when he's in his element: either witnessing a Giants win or ranting to strangers on the radio. The fact that he must write his speeches down beforehand, and preps himself for hours in advance of calling, says everything.\n\nPaul gets in trouble when he spots a Giants quarterback at a gas station in a shady neighborhood and follows him into a NYC nightclub. After an awkward introduction, Paul makes the mistake of mentioning that he's been following the sports star and his entourage for the past few hours, and the drunken athlete reacts by beating him senseless. Three days later Paul is hospitalized and the police want his statement -- but he suddenly "can't remember" anything that happened, desperately hoping the Giants won't be forced to suspend their star athlete. But that's just the beginning of his problems.\n\nBig Fan is the directorial debut of Robert D. Siegel, who wrote last year's sports-themed The Wrestler. Both movies concern the plights of apparent losers, the biggest difference being Mickey Rourke's 'Ram' actually had a life at one point, whereas Paul's existence is experienced vicariously. Everyone around him tries to offer a better life, whether it's jobs or moving into his own place, but he firmly rejects them. In Paul's eyes, this is his life. He is perfectly content to be discontent, and the movie's lack of transformation for its character will undoubtedly alienate some viewers.\n\nAnd, put bluntly, Big Fan is not as strong or poignant as The Wrestler. Siegel is not as capable a director as Darren Aronofsky, and the story -- despite clocking in at under an hour and a half -- does tend to meander a few times. But it is endearingly bleak, honest and real, and kept afloat by Oswalt's fascinating performance, which is hard to shake off even after the credits are over.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-09-18","keywords":"dark humor,man wears underwear,adult child lives at home,new york giants football,new york city","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652663/","name":"Patton Oswalt"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180984/","name":"Kevin Corrigan"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001650/","name":"Michael Rapaport"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1557909/","name":"Robert Siegel"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0130608/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0266284/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251178/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1557909/","name":"Robert Siegel"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Big Fan: Directed by Robert Siegel. With Patton Oswalt, Kevin Corrigan, Michael Rapaport, Marcia Jean Kurtz. A hard-core New York Giants fan struggles to deal with the consequences when he is beaten up by his favorite player." data-id="main"/&gt;&lt;script type="application/ld+json"&gt;"@context":"https://schema.org","@type":"Movie","url":"/title/tt1228953/","name":"Big Fan","image":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjExNjQxNTczMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwMjc5MTA3Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A hard-core New York Giants fan struggles to deal with the consequences when he is beaten up by his favorite player.","review":"@type":"Review","itemReviewed":"@type":"CreativeWork","url":"/title/tt1228953/","author":"@type":"Person","name":"MovieAddict2016","dateCreated":"2010-01-05","inLanguage":"English","name":"Kept afloat by Oswalt's fascinating performance, which is hard to shake off even after the credits are over.","reviewBody":"Paul is in his mid-thirties, single, and still living at home with his mother. He works as a parking lot attendant in New York, and is content to sit in his booth at night writing down passionate, articulate rants, so that when he goes home he can call a local radio sports show and prove his fanaticism for the Giants, his favorite football team.\n\nPaul is played by Patton Oswalt, one of the funniest stand-up comedians alive, and what he does in this film is really quite remarkable. He creates a fully convincing and pathetic loser, and is unafraid to reveal all the character's lowest points. If this were an Adam Sandler comedy we'd probably have scenes showing us how misunderstood and sweet Paul is, so we can understand that he's the one we're meant to root for, but Oswalt's Paul isn't so cleancut. He treats his family like crap and has terrible mood swings; he only seems truly happy when he's in his element: either witnessing a Giants win or ranting to strangers on the radio. The fact that he must write his speeches down beforehand, and preps himself for hours in advance of calling, says everything.\n\nPaul gets in trouble when he spots a Giants quarterback at a gas station in a shady neighborhood and follows him into a NYC nightclub. After an awkward introduction, Paul makes the mistake of mentioning that he's been following the sports star and his entourage for the past few hours, and the drunken athlete reacts by beating him senseless. Three days later Paul is hospitalized and the police want his statement -- but he suddenly "can't remember" anything that happened, desperately hoping the Giants won't be forced to suspend their star athlete. But that's just the beginning of his problems.\n\nBig Fan is the directorial debut of Robert D. Siegel, who wrote last year's sports-themed The Wrestler. Both movies concern the plights of apparent losers, the biggest difference being Mickey Rourke's 'Ram' actually had a life at one point, whereas Paul's existence is experienced vicariously. Everyone around him tries to offer a better life, whether it's jobs or moving into his own place, but he firmly rejects them. In Paul's eyes, this is his life. He is perfectly content to be discontent, and the movie's lack of transformation for its character will undoubtedly alienate some viewers.\n\nAnd, put bluntly, Big Fan is not as strong or poignant as The Wrestler. Siegel is not as capable a director as Darren Aronofsky, and the story -- despite clocking in at under an hour and a half -- does tend to meander a few times. But it is endearingly bleak, honest and real, and kept afloat by Oswalt's fascinating performance, which is hard to shake off even after the credits are over.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9296,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-09-18","keywords":"dark humor,man wears underwear,adult child lives at home,new york giants football,new york city","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0652663/","name":"Patton Oswalt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0180984/","name":"Kevin Corrigan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001650/","name":"Michael Rapaport"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1557909/","name":"Robert Siegel"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0130608/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0266284/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0251178/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1557909/","name":"Robert Siegel"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The story was inspired by true events.\n\nAugusta-Victoria College for Girls was located in Bexhill-On-Sea, and served as a finishing school for the daughters of the German elite from 1932 through 1939. We open as the school's English teacher, Mr. Wheatley (Nigel Lindsay), frantically flees when he realizes his undercover mission has been discovered. An artistically filmed sequence on the boardwalk ends with Wheatley missing and his bowler floating off on the horizon. We don't know yet what he uncovered, but Thomas Miller (co-writer Eddie Izzard) is quickly hired as the new teacher by Headmistress Miss Rocholl (Oscar winner Dame Judi Dench).\n\nTeacher Ilse Keller (Carla Juri) puts the girls through their robotic lessons and ensures they listen to Nazi propaganda on the radio. Of course, as in most spy thrillers, no one is as they seem - or at least most aren't. Most of the girls seem indistinguishable from each other, save for dark-haired and bespectacled Gretel (Tijan Marei), who is a true outcast. The girls are referred to as the "Hitler League of German Girls" and are being educated and groomed for the planned new socialist nation.\n\nIt doesn't take Miller long to uncover a plan, and almost immediately, he's wrongly accused of murder - sending him on the run. It's no spoiler to reveal that Miller is part of British Intelligence, and in the role, Izzard delivers a more restrained performance than what we are accustomed to (see OCEAN'S TWELVE and OCEAN'S THIRTEEN ... and it's very effective.

This offers us a bit of cat and mouse between Drey and Miller, and they are joined in the fun by Charlie the bus driver, played by the always interesting Jim Broadbent.\n\nThe plan to evacuate the girls before the war seems a bit overly complicated, but then my experience planning such war time strategy is admittedly non-existent.

Not being a banker or someone who is detached from human interaction in general, it is not easy to fully identify with the main character here. And there are flaws or at least weird decisions along the way ... but it is a comedy and it tries to be as funny as it can be overall.\n\nThat out of the way, I had no idea what the movie would be like or any story element, so color me shocked and surprised by the inciting incident at the start of the movie. I did not see that coming/happening. After that "bang" the movie takes a minute to breathe a little bit and that is the moment you see the human in our main character. Overall we get quite a few of cliches though, but still it does its best to stay on the right side of funny and delicate when it touches certain subjects.

Not being a banker or someone who is detached from human interaction in general, it is not easy to fully identify with the main character here. And there are flaws or at least weird decisions along the way ... but it is a comedy and it tries to be as funny as it can be overall.\n\nThat out of the way, I had no idea what the movie would be like or any story element, so color me shocked and surprised by the inciting incident at the start of the movie. I did not see that coming/happening. After that "bang" the movie takes a minute to breathe a little bit and that is the moment you see the human in our main character. Overall we get quite a few of cliches though, but still it does its best to stay on the right side of funny and delicate when it touches certain subjects. Funny but predictable - still entertaining if you let it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1680,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-03-21","keywords":"disability,wilhelm scream","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Die Goldfische","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3829447705","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZiZjViMDctZWE0Mi00NDdlLThjYzQtN2Q3YWQ0NjEyMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNDZiZjViMDctZWE0Mi00NDdlLThjYzQtN2Q3YWQ0NjEyMmE0XkEyXkFqcGdeQTNwaW5nZXN0._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0771713/","name":"Tom Schilling","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1678891/","name":"Klaas Heufer-Umlauf","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3474804/","name":"Lisa Bitter"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2285783/","name":"Alireza Golafshan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0027692/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0239725/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008261/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2285783/","name":"Alireza Golafshan","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1487045/","name":"Justyna Müsch"],"duration":"PT1H51M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I only saw one trailer for the film, and it immediately intrigued me. I did not hate this film, but I also did not love and found myself in a lukewarm middle ground. For everything I liked, there was something I did not like.\n\nFirst off, the story. The story as a whole deals with living life and dealing with death which was pulled off fairly well. However, there were several things in the script that I feel like took away from the film and the story Braff was telling. One of the those things were the laughs or lack thereof. \n\nThe script thinks its wittier and funnier than it actually is with most jokes missing that hitting. The movie also thinks it's deeper than it actually is. Maybe that's just Braff's style, but to me it seemed like it was more style over substance.\n\nI did really enjoy the soundtrack for the film and Braff gave a good performance as a 30-something-year-old treading the water in his life.\n\nI will definitely give Braff's future movies another shot and will see Garden State soon, but Wish I was Here was just not as good as I hoped it would be.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37685,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-07-25","keywords":"dream sequence,crowdfunded,sex scene,furry,office worker","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1612557593","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMzU2ODg0OTleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA3NjkzODEx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMzU2ODg0OTleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA3NjkzODEx._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Aidan Bloom, a struggling actor, father, and husband, who at 35 is still trying to find a purpose for his life.

I only saw one trailer for the film, and it immediately intrigued me. I did not hate this film, but I also did not love and found myself in a lukewarm middle ground. For everything I liked, there was something I did not like.\n\nFirst off, the story. The story as a whole deals with living life and dealing with death which was pulled off fairly well. However, there were several things in the script that I feel like took away from the film and the story Braff was telling. One of the those things were the laughs or lack thereof. \n\nThe script thinks its wittier and funnier than it actually is with most jokes missing that hitting. The movie also thinks it's deeper than it actually is. Maybe that's just Braff's style, but to me it seemed like it was more style over substance.\n\nI did really enjoy the soundtrack for the film and Braff gave a good performance as a 30-something-year-old treading the water in his life.\n\nI will definitely give Braff's future movies another shot and will see Garden State soon, but Wish I was Here was just not as good as I hoped it would be.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":37685,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-07-25","keywords":"dream sequence,crowdfunded,sex scene,furry,office worker","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1612557593","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMzU2ODg0OTleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA3NjkzODEx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTAxMzU2ODg0OTleQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDA3NjkzODEx._V1_.jpg","description":"The story of Aidan Bloom, a struggling actor, father, and husband, who at 35 is still trying to find a purpose for his life.

I was not all that excited about seeing it in the first place myself if I am going to be honest, but I only got it because there was nothing better to get I guess, and in the end, I had a fun time with it. Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz have good chemistry on set, not exactly Gone with the Wind type of romance, but enough to make it feel somewhat believable and make these characters interact well with the plot.\n\nThe movie is quite humorous. Not one of the funniest or even most memorable Rom-Coms I have ever seen, but here again, it does not try to be anything more than it is. The story is cute and entertaining if you give it even the slightest bit of chance to be, and though I would say if you are looking for a Rom-Com for you and your significant other there are plenty of better ones like The Proposal and The Ugly Truth you could see, if you have any interest in seeing this, I encourage you to do it because if you know what you are in for, it will be just what you needed. A refreshing little movie that deserves better reception.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":170898,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-05-07","keywords":"jackpot,father son relationship,casino,neo screwball comedy,male and female protagonists","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What Happens in Vegas ...

I was not all that excited about seeing it in the first place myself if I am going to be honest, but I only got it because there was nothing better to get I guess, and in the end, I had a fun time with it. Ashton Kutcher and Cameron Diaz have good chemistry on set, not exactly Gone with the Wind type of romance, but enough to make it feel somewhat believable and make these characters interact well with the plot.\n\nThe movie is quite humorous. Not one of the funniest or even most memorable Rom-Coms I have ever seen, but here again, it does not try to be anything more than it is. The story is cute and entertaining if you give it even the slightest bit of chance to be, and though I would say if you are looking for a Rom-Com for you and your significant other there are plenty of better ones like The Proposal and The Ugly Truth you could see, if you have any interest in seeing this, I encourage you to do it because if you know what you are in for, it will be just what you needed. A refreshing little movie that deserves better reception.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":170898,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2008-05-07","keywords":"jackpot,father son relationship,casino,neo screwball comedy,male and female protagonists","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"What Happens in Vegas ...

And as the blockbusters strive for the quality of the more highbrow indie offerings being nominated for Oscars, they begin resembling them in a way.\n\nThe Harry Potter films, especially the first few, had a sort of snappy storytelling to them. Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them does not. It's much slower like the later films in the previous series. Yet, the difference is, this is the setup to the next four films.

We get to go inside this magical suitcase and see dozens of unique creatures in this new expanded universe. It's really cool and aesthetically pleasing.\n\nThe movie is long and not enough happens to truly justify it. Instead of using the time to thoroughly explain some of the overarching story lines, the filmmakers spend it drawing things out. Perhaps because they feel like they have to.\n\nDon't get me wrong, the film is great. It's thoroughly enjoyable. It does most of the things a good film should do. While the storytelling isn't quick, it's still very even.\n\nThis is what director David Yates is good at, as evident in the last four Harry Potter films he directed. Though Fantastic Beasts is missing the magical world that is Hogwarts, Yates knows how to bring alive New York City in the '20s and make it feel magical.\n\nYou will most likely enjoy Fantastic Beasts.

While the visuals are as magical as ever, it's clear that the filmmakers are so distracted by trying to build a franchise that they're forgetting to actually tell a good story! The chemistry between our main four heroes was diluted by so many new characters being introduced. With so many new people and also so many questions for our old heroes, there wasn't enough time for any kind of (explainable) character development or for the viewers to connect with anyone on the screen. The only "character development" with one of our main heroes felt random and out of character and we aren't given much reason or warning for this change. I was also very disappointed with the writing behind Tina's character as her role was demoted from a strong willed Auror and woman to merely a side kick and love interest. Huge and important elements of the story were left for us only to assume what had happened when discussing the one year time jump between the two films (like the Jacob/Queenie relationship, Jacobs memory, etc.). As a whole, the film screamed "money hungry" and "franchise building" rather than letting us really connect with the characters. It also seemed as if they were only adding in twists that would surely get a reaction from viewers despite the fact that they not only discredited the original Harry Potter films, but just felt like unrealistic and a little too convenient! In short, as a huge fan of the Harry Potter Universe, I was disappointed, upset and felt really let down, and as a film goer, I was confused with the plot and frustrated with the lack of character connection and development! The only reason I have given a 4/10 instead of a 1 is for Eddie Redmayne's perfect execution of the shy, socially awkward but loveable and charming Newt Scamander and for the alluring performance from Jude Law's Dumbledore who leaves us wanting to know more of his history! But in the end, it was a huge disappointment as a stand-alone movie.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":241455,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Adventure","Family","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2018-11-16","keywords":"wizard,magical creature,paris france,sequel,witch","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Watch the Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi965130777","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlMmE1OTktODA5Yi00NDc3LTg4NDgtYzcyOTU2Nzg1OWU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTJlMmE1OTktODA5Yi00NDc3LTg4NDgtYzcyOTU2Nzg1OWU3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXZ3ZXNsZXk@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1519666/","name":"Eddie Redmayne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2239702/","name":"Katherine Waterston"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0283945/","name":"Dan Fogler"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0946734/","name":"David Yates"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0746830/","name":"J.K.

I would say I had pretty low knowledge in films before I first saw Inside Out (not to say that I'm highly intelligent on films now). I only saw about 200 films prior. I hadn't seen a lot of classic films or even know that film can be an art form just through its camera work among other aspects. So you could say that I can't speak for everyone on my views of this film. And you may be right because opinions are subjective anyway.\n\nThis is my favourite film ever.\n\nLike I said above, I didn't see a lot of films that were deemed as masterpieces at that time. While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nYet this is still my favourite film of all-time.\n\n80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.\n\nEver since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).\n\nInside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.\n\nIn the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.\n\nYou can vote "not helpful" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway. This is a beautiful film that will resonate in me always.\n\nI will never forget Inside Out.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":660021,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-17","keywords":"joy,sadness,anger,memory,running away","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Theaters: June 19","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi203730969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inside Out is in theaters on June 19!"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688132/","name":"Amy Poehler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352778/","name":"Bill Hader"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085400/","name":"Lewis Black"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498834/","name":"Meg LeFauve"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

As Episode 1 opens, Sandra Russo and Robin Young introduce themselves: "I'm your mother", Russo says to the interviewer (and director) Ry Russo-Young. "And I'm your mother too", adds Young. We then go back in time to 1979, as these ladies retell how they met and fell heads over heels for each other and very soon moved in together. Through two sperm donors, each of them has a baby girl. The sperm donors agree to waive all rights (and obligations)... At this point we are 10 min into the opening episode.\n\nCouple of comments: this is the latest film from Ry Russo-Young ("Before I Fall", "The Sun Is Also a Star"). Here she examines her own life and background, being raised by two moms in the early 80s when that was anything but normal/accepted, even in New York. Both sperm donors are in California, and gave up all parenting and visitation rights, but as luck would have it, they are both on great terms with Russo and Young, and in particular Tom (biological father of Ry) develops strong a strong bond with Ry. What could possibly go wrong? This in turn leads to the question: who/what constitutes a family? Obviously the film maker has unfettered access to her moms, and the series (or at least Episode 1) plays out mostly from that perspective. I can't wait to see the remaining two episodes.\n\n"Nuclear family" premiered last Sunday on HBO and Episode 1 is now available on HBO on Demand, HBO Max and other streaming platforms. New episodes air on Sunday evenings at 10 pm Eastern time. If you have any interest in LGTBQ and related social issues, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":293,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2021-09-26","keywords":"tv mini series","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm12980711/","name":"Cade Russo-Young"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1735543/","name":"Ry Russo-Young"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1096524/","name":"Jacob Estes"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0600458/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0208153/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0139821/"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1438499609","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRhMjc1MWQtZjYzOS00MWNiLWE1OTctMGVlMTJhMzZmNjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmRhMjc1MWQtZjYzOS00MWNiLWE1OTctMGVlMTJhMzZmNjMxXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg","description":"Ry Russo-Young turns the camera on her own past to explore the meaning of family."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I would say I had pretty low knowledge in films before I first saw Inside Out (not to say that I'm highly intelligent on films now). I only saw about 200 films prior. I hadn't seen a lot of classic films or even know that film can be an art form just through its camera work among other aspects. So you could say that I can't speak for everyone on my views of this film. And you may be right because opinions are subjective anyway.\n\nThis is my favourite film ever.\n\nLike I said above, I didn't see a lot of films that were deemed as masterpieces at that time. While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nYet this is still my favourite film of all-time.\n\n80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.\n\nEver since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).\n\nInside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.\n\nIn the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.\n\nYou can vote "not helpful" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway. This is a beautiful film that will resonate in me always.\n\nI will never forget Inside Out.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":660021,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2015-06-17","keywords":"joy,sadness,anger,memory,running away","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"In Theaters: June 19","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi203730969","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAyNDg5MjEwMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODQyNDM5NTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Inside Out is in theaters on June 19!"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0688132/","name":"Amy Poehler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0352778/","name":"Bill Hader"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0085400/","name":"Lewis Black"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017902/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0008970/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0230032/","name":"Pete Docter"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0215455/","name":"Ronnie Del Carmen"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0498834/","name":"Meg LeFauve"}],"duration":"PT1H35M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The only , basic , in fact problem, remains the dialogue. It reminds the wood language, the melodramatic speeches from the Romanian cinematography before 1990 and few films by Sergiu Nicolaescu after. Maybe it is not a real sin, maybe is trait of specific but , behind the story, very useful to be known , something remains not exactly finished.

And for love it - many reasons, from the admirable performance of Ruxandra Lupu, giving the fair and the nuanced , full merited portrait of the Queen to the imppecable costumes, use of English and Romanian and atmosphere. The only , basic , in fact problem, remains the dialogue. It reminds the wood language, the melodramatic speeches from the Romanian cinematography before 1990 and few films by Sergiu Nicolaescu after. Maybe it is not a real sin, maybe is trait of specific but , behind the story, very useful to be known , something remains not exactly finished. But, no doubts, a beautiful film and necessary for some reasons.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1968,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-11-08","keywords":"paris peace conference,world war one,treaty of versailles,kingdom of romania,romanian abroad","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi904511513","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA5ODQ2OTMtYmEyMi00N2NlLWI4NmMtYjUwODFiMzgyNmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMzA5ODQ2OTMtYmEyMi00N2NlLWI4NmMtYjUwODFiMzgyNmY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5404849/","name":"Roxana Lupu","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2088951/","name":"Daniel Plier","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0253355/","name":"Richard Elfyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0128636/","name":"Alexis Cahill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238186/","name":"Brigitte Drodtloff"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0087275/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0030727/","name":"Gabi Antal","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0128636/","name":"Alexis Cahill","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0238186/","name":"Brigitte Drodtloff"],"duration":"PT1H50M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

In Rocky V, Rocky Balboa is faced with such a scenario. This movie proves to me that you need to have more than one string to your arrow, as you never know when it might come in handy one day. Rocky V also points out that money and possession are not the important things in life, but family and (true) friends are!\n\nLosing it all does not mean a thing unless you've got something to lose  And Rocky Balboa had it all. Times have changed, though, for former Heavyweight champion of the world. A lifetime of fighting has taken its toll, mentally and physically, and the maneuverings of an scrupulous accountant have left him financially strapped. But resiliency and the ability to come back have been trademarks of the Rocky legend. Just when it looks like the champ is down for the count, he discovers the raw talent of a young fighter named Tommy Gunn, who just might be Rocky's last chance for glory. In a world where achievement is marked by dollars and cents, and in a profession where success is measured in wins and losses, Rocky Balboa knows that, whatever the struggle, your only hope is to give it your best shot.\n\n This film is probably the weakest of the five films in the Rocky series. Yet there are some very good parts to it. The way we see Rocky get over bankruptcy was very good, as is the way he eventually makes his family the most important thing in his life. Again I found this story to be good, though I guess it lacked that real Rocky feel to it, mainly because the champ was unwilling or unable to get into the ring. Stallone has done a grand job in being the writer of all the Rocky films. \n\nThe cast make a final appearance, that is reasonably good. Stallone is good as Rocky once again. His character is still trying to make a contribution to fighting, after being told that he can no longer professionally fight in the ring. So he helps out fresh talent, Tommy Machine' Gunn, who is acted by real life boxer Tommy Morrison. I found this character to be just far to arrogant and stubborn, which in a way did not suit being a part of the Balboa corner. Tommy has had an interesting life, not only fighting wise, but in a personal way. He has been caught in drug rackets, drink driving and admitted to the world that he has contracted the fatal HIV virus. I am not so sure he is the greatest of actors though.\n\nThe normal cast members were good. Talia Shire's character Adrian, lets the world know that her husband is finished boxing and has nothing else to prove in the boxing ring. Making a special appearance was star from the first three films, that of Burgess Meredith. Just seeing him onscreen was really satisfying. Mickey was a favourite character of mine. I must mention that I liked seeing Stallone's very own son Sage, in Rocky as Rocky's son, Rocky Jnr. He was pretty good as the son that felt left out in the cold. He also has a mean punch like the old man as well. \n\nI found that all the Rocky films had terrific soundtracks. This is due to the great work by composer, Bill Conti. Bill has done a wonderful job in organising the music to go with all the fighting scenes and the poignant scenes which require that tune to set them off just nicely. Rocky five had probably the best song on any of the soundtracks, that being the Elton John hit Measure of a man'. I think it is a wonderful song, with some terrific lyrics. I have loved most of the music that the Rocky movies have given us.\n\nRocky V might not be the best movie ever made, but it certainly had some sort of impact on me. I believe if a movie only makes a slight impression on you, then it has achieved in a small way what it was meant to do. I heard that plans for Rocky VI were being made, with a script finished by Stallone just a few years ago. Personally, I feel that if it was to be made it would not be that great a film, because Balboa can no longer make a comeback in the ring, and if he does, he could well become  as his wife said disabled'. All things being said, these films are a terrific avenue of motivation and can help any person get the spark back to turn their luck around in any venture they pursue.\n\nRating 3 Stars or 6.5/10"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":132607,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.3},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Drama","Sport"],"datePublished":"1990-11-16","keywords":"rocky balboa jr character,rocky balboa character,adrian character,paulie character,mickey goldmill character","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000230/","name":"Sylvester Stallone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001735/","name":"Talia Shire"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0949350/","name":"Burt Young"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000814/","name":"John G.

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks.

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over.

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over. Google it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":795708,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,despair","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over. Google it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":795708,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,despair","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The timeline is set back to 1984. Skynet sends its own terminator from 2029, to kill Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), mother of future subversive leader of the resistance, John Connor (Jason Clarke). Consequently, a human, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is also sent to stop the terminator, in humanity's desperate hope to save their species. At the time, Sarah is already being protected by her guardian terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), whose reasons of arriving in her time, is seemingly set to be never known.\n\nTime-travel has always been a fascinating subject, and it in such fashion that Terminator: Genisys, attempts to build its own stronghold in the mold of the first two films. The take assumes an interesting onset, depicting an apocalyptic future where machines lord over the human minority, but it spirals down to fatal loops of nonsensical uncreatively-staged retreads when the what can be considered the inception of human salvation (Schwarzenegger's Terminator's arrival), begins. Once the deadly cat-and-mouse chases spin out of control, confusion begins, and the film itself, can't be bothered to clear off heads as it totally busy itself to trying to awe-inspire spectators, with elaborately-constructed action setpieces, teeming with CGI-mastered explosions, pursuits, and fight scenes. There's no denying that such attempt is carried out with colossal success, but the audience would inevitably find appreciating the feat, difficult and pointless . The proceedings are sutured into recreations of some iconic scenes of the original movies, while also devising its own, at the same time. But even with all these efforts, GENISYS still fails to generate sustained interest.

The timeline is set back to 1984. Skynet sends its own terminator from 2029, to kill Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke), mother of future subversive leader of the resistance, John Connor (Jason Clarke). Consequently, a human, Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) is also sent to stop the terminator, in humanity's desperate hope to save their species. At the time, Sarah is already being protected by her guardian terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger), whose reasons of arriving in her time, is seemingly set to be never known.\n\nTime-travel has always been a fascinating subject, and it in such fashion that Terminator: Genisys, attempts to build its own stronghold in the mold of the first two films. The take assumes an interesting onset, depicting an apocalyptic future where machines lord over the human minority, but it spirals down to fatal loops of nonsensical uncreatively-staged retreads when the what can be considered the inception of human salvation (Schwarzenegger's Terminator's arrival), begins. Once the deadly cat-and-mouse chases spin out of control, confusion begins, and the film itself, can't be bothered to clear off heads as it totally busy itself to trying to awe-inspire spectators, with elaborately-constructed action setpieces, teeming with CGI-mastered explosions, pursuits, and fight scenes. There's no denying that such attempt is carried out with colossal success, but the audience would inevitably find appreciating the feat, difficult and pointless . The proceedings are sutured into recreations of some iconic scenes of the original movies, while also devising its own, at the same time. But even with all these efforts, GENISYS still fails to generate sustained interest. The result of its motives manages to hit some of the nostalgic beats of the franchise, but tepid one-liners and confusing paradoxes would drag down its capacity to last. It is also by these narrative defects that interest is being stripped off its key players, making the audience barely care about the characters and the imminence of their extinction. This is why Genisys is way below the glory of its predecessors--the dread is barely present, and fear is forced, thus ineffective.\n\nThere is a screaming irony that bursts at the heels of this attempt to reinvigorate the sagging Terminator series: The Terminator (Schwarzenegger) returns to the past to save the whole of humankind, but the mess that is GENISYS, murders the franchise. 5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":268924,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.3,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2015-07-08","keywords":"cyborg,future,sarah connor,time machine,human versus cyborg","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1249751321","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MTg5OTExOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM0OTEzNTE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjM1MTg5OTExOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM0OTEzNTE@._V1_.jpg","description":"When John Connor, leader of the human resistance, sends Sgt.

I'm pretty sure I saw this in the theater with my family and then went again with friends. This is another one that I picked up pretty quickly after it came out on DVD and have watched it throughout the years. Again, this is another one that I hadn't seen in some time with a critical eye so I was wondering how it would hold up. The synopsis here is Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in Raccon City hospital after they're has been overrun by zombies and must now make it out of the city before a nuclear bomb is dropped.\n\nWe start with giving us the back-story of what happened in the previous film from our main character of Alice. This includes the events involving her at the end and waking up again in the hospital where we get a cool shot paying homage to Day of the Dead with the newspaper headline.\n\nIt then shifts to Raccoon City to show us the events that will lead to what we just saw. Everyone is going about their daily lives and it feels like a normal Midwestern city. We are taken below the ground to the entrance to The Hive. Umbrella employees are opening it and are overtaken by infected. T-virus spreads out of into the city. Umbrella sends in SUVs to collect important scientists that are living there. One of them is Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris). He is concerned about his daughter and he is informed that she is being picked up as well. Her name is Angie (Sophie Vavasseur). She gets picked up, but there's an accident leaving her stranded.\n\nWe then get to meet Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory). She enters her home and hears over a scanner of what is happening. We get a cool introduction through a board she has detailing she's suspended. She goes to her station and takes out the zombies that are in there. She meets with her partner and tells him to get out before it's too late. She also frees L.J. (Mike Epps), who was in custody. Everything is breaking down around them.\n\nUmbrella is forced to close off the city and not allow anyone to escape. Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann) makes this decision which causes Dr. Ashford to try to find someone alive inside of the city to help get Angie out. Alice finds an Army/Navy surplus store, gets dressed and finds weapons. She encounters Jill, Sgt. Peyton Wells (Razaaq Adoti) and some other survivors. They band together and learn of their way out when Dr. Ashford calls them on a payphone. He's able to hack into the Raccoon City mainframe to do this. They then head for the school, but encounter a much more dangerous threat. Alice isn't the only one that Umbrella has been experimenting on.\n\nThey also encounter a group of Umbrella para-military members. They're led by Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr). With him are Nicholai Ginovaeff (Zack Ward) and Yuri Loginova (Stefan Hayes). They're bitter when they're not evacuated and are all too ready to turn their back on the company that stranded them inside the city limits.\n\nThat's where I want to leave the recap for this movie. This is another one that now I'm a bit more critical of movies while also being fair, I wasn't sure how this movie would hold up for me. As I started this I said I've seen this quite a few times and after this viewing, I still really like it. It for sure is still my favorite in the series.\n\nThis of course is taking on the games of Resident Evil 2 and 3, where the infection has gotten out and our survivors are trying to get out of town before Raccoon City is 'contained' and wiped out. I dig that they brought in Jill, Carlos, Dr. Ashford, Nemesis (Matthew G. Taylor) and Nicholai. There is also the unit of S.T.A.R.S. that they include here as well. They all aren't necessarily the characters from the game, but it is at least hitting the nerd part of me there. I do have to comment, I hate that they used the outfit Jill wears in Resident Evil 3, as it is not very practical.\n\nWhat I also like here is that we still get part of that contained feel that we do from the previous film, just in a bigger sandbox to play in. It is this time around I noticed we really aren't getting a lot of the zombies. There's some of that, it is mostly early on before we get to some of the stronger villains. This isn't that dissimilar to the games themselves though. The main problem of the story works for me. Umbrella is constantly making bad decisions that they need to fix. They also seem to be a bit overconfident. I also like the idea that the 'Nemesis Project' is focusing on Alice and Nemesis. They're too sides to the coin there where one is smaller and more agile to the bulker, stronger one. The showdown is inevitable. This does pigeon hole it into the action/horror film that it is.\n\nFeel that next should be the acting. Jovovich is really good as our heroine here. I like that she just has this look of Alice and fits so well into the role. When I see her that is one of the things I think of first. Guillory wasn't who I pictured at first as Jill, but I think she does a really good there. Fehr is good as Carlos. I really like Kretschmann as a villain. He is spineless, but that fits and we don't get to see it until the end. Vavasseur is fine, Adoti, Ward and the rest of the cast are as well. I really liked seeing Harris and Epps here for completely different reasons. Taylor fits what was needed for Nemesis with the size. Also the small cameo by Iain Glen which grows into a much bigger role of Dr. Isaacs, I liked the intro to him here. Since he becomes so important to the series, I like that we get him here to start.\n\nThat will take me to the effects and cinematography. I was surprised how much better the special effects were here. The zombies all look good. The CGI for the lickers looks much better here. The action effects are fine for the most part. I actually have some issues with the cinematography for them. They decide to go with this blurry effect and some of the camera work took me out of what I was seeing. Some of the CGI there doesn't necessarily hold for me as well.\n\nSo now with that said, this to me is one of the better video game adaptation horror movies out there. I like what they're doing with the concept here and it is the logical next step. Resident Evil 2 is my favorite of the series so combining that with 3 works for me since they take place at the same time.

I'm pretty sure I saw this in the theater with my family and then went again with friends. This is another one that I picked up pretty quickly after it came out on DVD and have watched it throughout the years. Again, this is another one that I hadn't seen in some time with a critical eye so I was wondering how it would hold up. The synopsis here is Alice (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in Raccon City hospital after they're has been overrun by zombies and must now make it out of the city before a nuclear bomb is dropped.\n\nWe start with giving us the back-story of what happened in the previous film from our main character of Alice. This includes the events involving her at the end and waking up again in the hospital where we get a cool shot paying homage to Day of the Dead with the newspaper headline.\n\nIt then shifts to Raccoon City to show us the events that will lead to what we just saw. Everyone is going about their daily lives and it feels like a normal Midwestern city. We are taken below the ground to the entrance to The Hive. Umbrella employees are opening it and are overtaken by infected. T-virus spreads out of into the city. Umbrella sends in SUVs to collect important scientists that are living there. One of them is Dr. Ashford (Jared Harris). He is concerned about his daughter and he is informed that she is being picked up as well. Her name is Angie (Sophie Vavasseur). She gets picked up, but there's an accident leaving her stranded.\n\nWe then get to meet Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory). She enters her home and hears over a scanner of what is happening. We get a cool introduction through a board she has detailing she's suspended. She goes to her station and takes out the zombies that are in there. She meets with her partner and tells him to get out before it's too late. She also frees L.J. (Mike Epps), who was in custody. Everything is breaking down around them.\n\nUmbrella is forced to close off the city and not allow anyone to escape. Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann) makes this decision which causes Dr. Ashford to try to find someone alive inside of the city to help get Angie out. Alice finds an Army/Navy surplus store, gets dressed and finds weapons. She encounters Jill, Sgt. Peyton Wells (Razaaq Adoti) and some other survivors. They band together and learn of their way out when Dr. Ashford calls them on a payphone. He's able to hack into the Raccoon City mainframe to do this. They then head for the school, but encounter a much more dangerous threat. Alice isn't the only one that Umbrella has been experimenting on.\n\nThey also encounter a group of Umbrella para-military members. They're led by Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr). With him are Nicholai Ginovaeff (Zack Ward) and Yuri Loginova (Stefan Hayes). They're bitter when they're not evacuated and are all too ready to turn their back on the company that stranded them inside the city limits.\n\nThat's where I want to leave the recap for this movie. This is another one that now I'm a bit more critical of movies while also being fair, I wasn't sure how this movie would hold up for me. As I started this I said I've seen this quite a few times and after this viewing, I still really like it. It for sure is still my favorite in the series.\n\nThis of course is taking on the games of Resident Evil 2 and 3, where the infection has gotten out and our survivors are trying to get out of town before Raccoon City is 'contained' and wiped out. I dig that they brought in Jill, Carlos, Dr. Ashford, Nemesis (Matthew G. Taylor) and Nicholai. There is also the unit of S.T.A.R.S. that they include here as well. They all aren't necessarily the characters from the game, but it is at least hitting the nerd part of me there. I do have to comment, I hate that they used the outfit Jill wears in Resident Evil 3, as it is not very practical.\n\nWhat I also like here is that we still get part of that contained feel that we do from the previous film, just in a bigger sandbox to play in. It is this time around I noticed we really aren't getting a lot of the zombies. There's some of that, it is mostly early on before we get to some of the stronger villains. This isn't that dissimilar to the games themselves though. The main problem of the story works for me. Umbrella is constantly making bad decisions that they need to fix. They also seem to be a bit overconfident. I also like the idea that the 'Nemesis Project' is focusing on Alice and Nemesis. They're too sides to the coin there where one is smaller and more agile to the bulker, stronger one. The showdown is inevitable. This does pigeon hole it into the action/horror film that it is.\n\nFeel that next should be the acting. Jovovich is really good as our heroine here. I like that she just has this look of Alice and fits so well into the role. When I see her that is one of the things I think of first. Guillory wasn't who I pictured at first as Jill, but I think she does a really good there. Fehr is good as Carlos. I really like Kretschmann as a villain. He is spineless, but that fits and we don't get to see it until the end. Vavasseur is fine, Adoti, Ward and the rest of the cast are as well. I really liked seeing Harris and Epps here for completely different reasons. Taylor fits what was needed for Nemesis with the size. Also the small cameo by Iain Glen which grows into a much bigger role of Dr. Isaacs, I liked the intro to him here. Since he becomes so important to the series, I like that we get him here to start.\n\nThat will take me to the effects and cinematography. I was surprised how much better the special effects were here. The zombies all look good. The CGI for the lickers looks much better here. The action effects are fine for the most part. I actually have some issues with the cinematography for them. They decide to go with this blurry effect and some of the camera work took me out of what I was seeing. Some of the CGI there doesn't necessarily hold for me as well.\n\nSo now with that said, this to me is one of the better video game adaptation horror movies out there. I like what they're doing with the concept here and it is the logical next step. Resident Evil 2 is my favorite of the series so combining that with 3 works for me since they take place at the same time. Bringing characters from the game tick my nerd box, even if they're not necessarily the same. Some of the action and effects work, there are just some slight issues there for me. The acting is fine, no one necessarily stands out as great though and the soundtrack also just fits for what was needed. Overall I'd rate this as fun movie and to me, it is an above average movie overall.\n\nMy Rating: 7.5 out of 10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":192886,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2004-12-29","keywords":"monster,nuclear explosion,explosion,strong female character,strong female lead","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Resident Evil: Apocalypse","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2810380569","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjM5ODI4MWEtMjhhYy00NzU3LTg2YmEtYjczNjExOTBiYzIyXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Resident Evil: Apocalypse","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000170/","name":"Milla Jovovich","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0347149/","name":"Sienna Guillory","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0531095/","name":"Eric Mabius"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0936838/","name":"Alexander Witt"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0286424/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002257/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0890849/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0027271/","name":"Paul W.S.

The L Word is back and it's not bad at all!","reviewBody":"The L Word changed my life. I was a very confused 14 year Colombian girl living in a very small city with my very Catholic family. I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot". I realized that I was, and I am, lesbian. I know the show ended up being crap. But we can't let the bad things overshadow what this show meant, and still means, to people like me.\n\nMy girlfriend and I were afraid of watching this new generation, we were afraid of watching a disaster even worse that what ended up to be the original show. We were afraid that "The L Word", the lesbian word, would fall in the background. I am not against the Q generation, but I do feel that we lesbians all around the world are losing great spaces like for example: all women, lesbian bars. I love that today, people are not afraid of putting on, or not to putting on, a label. But we need The L Word right now more than ever. You can see for yourself. Search how many lesbian bars have disappeared all around the globe in the last 10 years, it's sad. There are just a couple left.\n\nI just watched the first 2 episodes and I feel so happy. I am feeling like a teenager, watching the show on mute with the captions on, every Sunday at 11pm on school's nights. Feeling scared and happy at the same time. Waiting the whole week just for that one hour of television where I could watch women like me. We did exist! I was not the only one!\n\n I think the choices they made with the old characters are great. I think this new show is very smart and it keeps the essence of the first seasons of the original one. I am very happy with this transition.\n\nI really want this show to succeed. I want to know more about the old characters, I want cameos. But also, I want to know more about the new characters. I am very excited and enjoyed the hell out of these episodes.\n\nYeah, the show is silly sometimes but it doesn't take itself too seriously and shouldn't we. This show was and still is groundbreaking, it's tone varies but the message is very clear.\n\nI am very glad Jennifer, Leisha and Kate did this. And I am so happy that they are the producers and have a lot of creative power. They can't let Ilene Chaiken ruin this again.\n\nWatch it. I was not going to to do it because of the reviews and that is so stupid. Just give it an opportunity.\n\nI love this cast, they have great chemistry.\n\nThis show is not about fixing the mistakes made in the past. They can't resurrect Dana and, they actually did a great job with the Jenny situation....one line was more than enough to end that mess.\n\nI hope to get a lot of more seasons. Why the LGBTQ+ community hates the LGBTQ+ community so much?\n\nLike for real. I don't get why anyone can be pissed at this show. Just don't watch it if you don't like it but you can't say it's not a great deal for our community and for us, lesbians.\n\nLesbian, from Lesbos. The origin of the L word is beautiful. Read about Sappho, read her poems. We should be proud of it and we should celebrate it.\n\nWe need more shows like this. Visibility is our best allied, don't forget that.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":5372,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"TV-MA","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-12-08","keywords":"lesbian","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000884/","name":"Jennifer Beals"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0595485/","name":"Katherine Moennig"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0354157/","name":"Leisha Hailey"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0886561/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0052980/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271093/","name":"Michele Abbott"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0149669/","name":"Ilene Chaiken"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1271884/","name":"Kathy Greenberg"}],"trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Season 2 Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3625959449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmYzNGQzZjQtZGYxOS00OTRiLTg2ZDEtYzhhMmQzYzU5NjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmYzNGQzZjQtZGYxOS00OTRiLTg2ZDEtYzhhMmQzYzU5NjMzXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Season 2 is available to stream August 6, 2021 on SHOWTIME."}}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

I was not old enough to watch the show but fk it, I finally understood why I felt out of place and I didn't "get it" when my friends talked about some "boy being super hot".

He may be a little to witty to suggest the overshadowed character he portrays, but he simply disappears into the role. Annette Bening is also fine; a less strong role, but she is magnificent none the less. As the teenagers, Thora Birch is able to mesmerize us with one intense look; her "typical teenager" role is fleshed out completely. I enjoyed Mena Suvari's character equally. It seemed that she did not receive as much acclaim, but her performance evokes both innocence and experience, and her scenes toward the end give her a depth unlike any other character. And Wes Bentley, as the video-taping boy next door, is easily the most original character. At first he seems a little tense, but, like Spacey, he sinks into the role. His "purpose" in the film, unlike anyone else's, is a mystery, thus making him the most enigmatic person.\n\nMost films are able to make a lasting impression on its audience, but never has a movie been known to "move" its viewers as much as this movie.

It goes back and forth between completely ridiculous to somewhat interesting. Unfortunately it is also a pale imitation to the novel its based on, only using the bare skeleton of the story, and not delving into what truly made the novel profound. Michael B. Jordan's character was so completely ridiculous and different than the novel version in the first 15 minutes that I nearly stopped watching it, but thankfully that subsides.

Jordan's character was so completely ridiculous and different than the novel version in the first 15 minutes that I nearly stopped watching it, but thankfully that subsides.

There is one quote that Miranda (Streep) has later in the movie and I think it is dead on 100% correct: "everybody wants to be like us".\n\nThe movie sends a strong message, more than just a quest for self-knowledge. It tells us more than fame isn't everything. It tells us that in order to truly be happy as yourself, you must experience what you want to be. Everybody wants to be famous. Everybody wants to be skinny. Everybody wants to be sexy. Only when you are famous, skinny, sexy, famous can you be satisfied of it. There is a quote a friend of mine used a while back; "You can't be taught what bitter tastes like. No matter how many people tell you that you won't like something bitter, you will want it. Everybody must taste something bitter and learn that they don't like it." This quote applies very well to this film.

There is one quote that Miranda (Streep) has later in the movie and I think it is dead on 100% correct: "everybody wants to be like us".\n\nThe movie sends a strong message, more than just a quest for self-knowledge. It tells us more than fame isn't everything. It tells us that in order to truly be happy as yourself, you must experience what you want to be. Everybody wants to be famous. Everybody wants to be skinny. Everybody wants to be sexy. Only when you are famous, skinny, sexy, famous can you be satisfied of it. There is a quote a friend of mine used a while back; "You can't be taught what bitter tastes like. No matter how many people tell you that you won't like something bitter, you will want it. Everybody must taste something bitter and learn that they don't like it." This quote applies very well to this film.

His recent films Inception, Interstellar, and Dunkirk are three of the best things I've ever seen on film and I automatically want to see whatever new production he comes out with. So, I'm just back from the theater having seen Tenet for the first time (I'm pretty sure there will be a second and third time) and in one sense I have no idea what rating to give. At a minimum it would be worth at least 6/10 for its technical quality alone. But it might be 10/10 for the quality of its fiendishly intricate storyline, which leaves your head spinning by the end. But it' s not without a few problems (see below). So, OK -- 8/10 it is.\n\nAmong Nolan's previous works I'd say 'Tenet' owes the most to 'Inception' for its complex, ever-shifting, multilayered plot. For Inception it was the Russian-doll dreamworlds within dreamworlds. For Tenet, it's playing with time and time reversal (as you see from any trailer or synopsis out there). We've had any number of time-travel movies before, and one sure thing they're good for is setting up paradoxes, but the way Nolan deploys this on screen is at times genuinely and startlingly new (as just one example, there's a car chase on a busy freeway where one car is speeding backwards but time-reversed, so from its POV it's racing forward, which is why it can travel that fast driving backward ... and there are many more scenes that I won't spoil.) There are things here we've never seen on screen before.\n\nIn the barest of bare-bones summary, the plot is all about a hunt for The Algorithm, something that enables this messing with the timeline The uber-evil Andrei (Kenneth Branagh) aims to use it to start WW III, or even (in a total burst of nihilism) ring down the curtain on all of reality. The shadowy team called Tenet aims to stop this. Keep up with it if you can. On the surface, it's an excellent James Bond imitation. Exposition scenes are followed by thunderous action, rinse, repeat -- pretty much from start to finish. How confused you are at any given moment depends (like Inception) on how many questions are running through your mind: why are we in THIS location now, who's doing what to whom, and what precisely are the characters after? The overall impression, though (again, like Inception) is that there IS substance underneath the high-octane surface and that repeated viewings and study will bring it out. We'll see.\n\nSo the production quality is, as usual for Nolan, first-rate. There are big, bravura scenes (wait till you see the big opener in a concert hall) but plenty of close, person-to-person ones to balance. One thing that might be a little jarring is that the scene-to-scene transitions are extremely abrupt and extremely frequent, and I assume that's deliberate -- there's no time for viewers to think even if we want to. But I'll accept that as a feature rather than a bug. The overall flow isn't necessarily helped by the music score (by Ludwig Goransson), which is epic but also insistent and omnipresent. Too much of a good thing. Lots of the personal scenes would just have worked better for me with no background score stepping on the dialog.\n\nFor the acting: I thought John David Washington (as The Protagonist) was OK but rather wooden, and he's on screen most of the time. I kept visualizing Will Smith in the part instead -- but maybe he'd have taken over the movie too much and that's not the result Nolan wanted? I don't know. But I liked Robert Pattinson and Elizabeth Debicki quite a lot. They both have substantial, essential roles and they have more nuance and humanity than anything they've done before. Kenneth Branagh still can't do a good Russian accent (though to be fair, not many native-English actors can) and although he's fine, I think as an actor he's much better suited to Shakespeare or Hercule Poirot. There's a big cast of smaller roles (among which is the always-welcome Michael Caine), adding to the difficulty of keeping up with what's developing.\n\nSo there it is. I'm looking forward to figuring out more of what's under the hood of this thing.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":435224,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-08-26","keywords":"time paradox,time reversal,car chase,espionage,bearded man","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Final Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2051194393","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZWM4MDJjNzMtYjk5Ni00MTJkLThlNjAtZDdjODhlNzU4ZTcwXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Armed with only one word, Tenet, and fighting for the survival of the entire world, a Protagonist journeys through a twilight world of international espionage on a mission that will unfold in something beyond real time."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0913475/","name":"John David Washington"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1500155/","name":"Robert Pattinson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4456120/","name":"Elizabeth Debicki"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0147954/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0634240/","name":"Christopher Nolan"}],"duration":"PT2H30M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Prior to its theatrical release this October, "Tropa" was seen by an estimated record 11 million people who bought pirate DVD copies or illegally downloaded it on the net (the biggest Brazilian box-office success in the last 25 years was "2 Filhos de Francisco" with 5,5 million tickets sold).\n\nThe reaction is passionately polarized: some call it the best Brazilian movie since "City of God" -- a definite influence here, in the cinematography, editing and screenplay structure, with an omniscient narrator and use of mixed chronology -- exposing the endemic corruption of Rio de Janeiro's police force and the "unorthodox" methods used by BOPE (the self-called "incorruptible" elite squad of Rio's military police force, created in 1978 and inspired by the U.S. SWAT) that include torture and shoot-first-ask-later modus operandi in the ultra-violent, ever-growing drug war in Rio's favelas. Others have publicly attacked it as fascist in its glorification of BOPE, its sadistic depiction of torture and the reductionist, simple-minded vision of the complex issues involving violence/ drugs/police corruption in Rio. \n\nDirector José Padilha and co-writer Rodrigo Pimentel (a former BOPE captain who left the squad for disagreeing with its praxis) had collaborated in the extraordinary "Bus 174", a multi-faceted documentary on Rio's violence. In "Tropa", they controversially chose to give us a deliberately biased vision of the problem: from the start we're stuck with one man, the overstressed, rebellious, self-righteous Capt Nascimento (Wagner Moura) in his journey into becoming a psychopathic sadist and hot-blooded killer, who believes drug traffic is caused by the druggie middle-class bourgeoisie (as if the poor didn't do drugs!) and claims the solution is to kill all traffickers. To Nascimento, corruption is abominable; torture isn't.\n\nNascimento is the film's absolute protagonist, narrator, commentator and "truth-puker". In his mind, all non-elite policemen are corrupt and incompetent, all charity NGOs in the favelas are cover-up fraudulent enterprises, all college students are useless double-faced potheads, and legal procedures are an inefficient waste of time.

Nascimento's motto. He's a vigilante in uniform, in the tradition of the executioners played by Eastwood, Bronson, Stallone and 24 Hours' Jack Bauer; he's the heir to the 1970s' Brazilian military regime know-how on torture. Yet, the film tries hard at "humanizing" Nascimento: his wife's pregnant, his marriage falters, he's moved to tears by the suffering of a mother who lost her son in the traffic war, he's in medication for his panic attacks. AND he's trying to save the POPE's life, no less! \n\nAll the other characters are just rough sketches or caricatures. The one character who might be the classical "narrator/observer" (like Buscapé/Rocket in "City of God") is the idealist, Foucault-reading aspiring police officer Mathias (though it's hard to believe an aspiring officer could afford to attend Rio's most expensive law school). But Mathias, too, is finally co-opted by the brainwashing "Full-Metal-Jacket"-like BOPE training that changes him into an amoral beast fueled with rage.\n\nPadilha says he wanted to portray Nascimento as a monster, and that audiences who are hailing Nascimento as a "hero" and BOPE as a "model" institution have caught him by surprise -- oh, really? Padilha is probably being sarcastic, naive or silly: everybody knows movie vigilante cops have been consistently idolized the world over (and co- writer Pimentel has publicly disagreed, stating the "Tropa" is clearly pro-BOPE). The graphic, sadistic scenes of torture -- supposedly meant to inspire disgust -- make the delight of a large vigilante-minded part of the audience. And Wagner Moura's extraordinary, scary performance as Nascimento is unsettling: we can't dismiss him as a stupid fascist the way we dismissed inarticulate stiffs like Bronson, Seagal or Stallone. The fact is that there's now a BOPE cult-following, with BOPE's logo (a skull pierced by pistols and knives) reproduced on t-shirts and underwear, BOPE officers being cheered in the streets in their armored "glory", and young kids (from all social classes) mimicking the film's "bag-in-the-head torture" as a new bullying style. \n\nMilitarists and pacifists will hardly change sides after the watching the film; militarists will have multiple orgasms and pacifists will cringe in horror. The filmmakers aren't interested in seriously discussing the drug issue (legalization is not even mentioned as an option). Nor in exposing Rio's drug traffic's multi-fingered interconnections, the zillion-dollar, highly organized international business involving farmers, money-washing executives, chemistry labs, gun-runners, bankers, politicians, accountants, lawyers, transport systems, etc. Nor in showing the real victims: the majority of the favela inhabitants, who aren't involved in the drug business but have to live under its rules, mere "extras" whose fate (in movies and in real life) is to be used, humiliated, segregated or, worse, wounded/killed by random bullets from BOTH policemen and traffickers. \n\n"Tropa" is a must-see film, but it's misleading and entrapping: by opting for an "open", "what would YOU do?" ending (probably influenced by the breathtaking finale of "Paradise Now"), the filmmakers demands us to take sides about a very, VERY complex issue they've shown us only ONE angle of.

Prior to its theatrical release this October, "Tropa" was seen by an estimated record 11 million people who bought pirate DVD copies or illegally downloaded it on the net (the biggest Brazilian box-office success in the last 25 years was "2 Filhos de Francisco" with 5,5 million tickets sold).\n\nThe reaction is passionately polarized: some call it the best Brazilian movie since "City of God" -- a definite influence here, in the cinematography, editing and screenplay structure, with an omniscient narrator and use of mixed chronology -- exposing the endemic corruption of Rio de Janeiro's police force and the "unorthodox" methods used by BOPE (the self-called "incorruptible" elite squad of Rio's military police force, created in 1978 and inspired by the U.S. SWAT) that include torture and shoot-first-ask-later modus operandi in the ultra-violent, ever-growing drug war in Rio's favelas. Others have publicly attacked it as fascist in its glorification of BOPE, its sadistic depiction of torture and the reductionist, simple-minded vision of the complex issues involving violence/ drugs/police corruption in Rio. \n\nDirector José Padilha and co-writer Rodrigo Pimentel (a former BOPE captain who left the squad for disagreeing with its praxis) had collaborated in the extraordinary "Bus 174", a multi-faceted documentary on Rio's violence. In "Tropa", they controversially chose to give us a deliberately biased vision of the problem: from the start we're stuck with one man, the overstressed, rebellious, self-righteous Capt Nascimento (Wagner Moura) in his journey into becoming a psychopathic sadist and hot-blooded killer, who believes drug traffic is caused by the druggie middle-class bourgeoisie (as if the poor didn't do drugs!) and claims the solution is to kill all traffickers. To Nascimento, corruption is abominable; torture isn't.\n\nNascimento is the film's absolute protagonist, narrator, commentator and "truth-puker". In his mind, all non-elite policemen are corrupt and incompetent, all charity NGOs in the favelas are cover-up fraudulent enterprises, all college students are useless double-faced potheads, and legal procedures are an inefficient waste of time. He's nearer to the traffickers' violent, revenge-based, lawless ethics than he's ever able to realize.\n\n"There's nothing wrong with shooting people if you shoot the right people", used to say Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry back in the 1970s, and it could well be Capt. Nascimento's motto. He's a vigilante in uniform, in the tradition of the executioners played by Eastwood, Bronson, Stallone and 24 Hours' Jack Bauer; he's the heir to the 1970s' Brazilian military regime know-how on torture. Yet, the film tries hard at "humanizing" Nascimento: his wife's pregnant, his marriage falters, he's moved to tears by the suffering of a mother who lost her son in the traffic war, he's in medication for his panic attacks. AND he's trying to save the POPE's life, no less! \n\nAll the other characters are just rough sketches or caricatures.

Luther sees a Caribbean cruise poster in a Chicago travel agency window, and he begins to plan the trip. First he must see how he will pay for the trip, so he comes up with an idea that if they skipped Christmas, they could go. He will save money by not buying a tree, having a party, or putting up decorations. The neighbors think he is crazy and want him to at least put Frosty the Snowman on his roof for the local decoration contest. The battle begins between the Kranks and their neighbors. Then Blair calls and tells her parents that she is flying home for Christmas with her fiancée. They have twenty-four hours to put up all the decorations and prepare for the Christmas party. The movie was based on a John Grisham book, 'Skipping Christmas'. It is a cute Christmas story with a lot of funny slapstick sketches. It reminds you of the Chevy Chase movie, 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'. Tim Allen does a great job in several comedy scenes, especially, the scenes where he gets bowtox injections in his face and the suntan scene.

The neighbors think he is crazy and want him to at least put Frosty the Snowman on his roof for the local decoration contest. The battle begins between the Kranks and their neighbors. Then Blair calls and tells her parents that she is flying home for Christmas with her fiancée. They have twenty-four hours to put up all the decorations and prepare for the Christmas party. The movie was based on a John Grisham book, 'Skipping Christmas'. It is a cute Christmas story with a lot of funny slapstick sketches. It reminds you of the Chevy Chase movie, 'National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation'. Tim Allen does a great job in several comedy scenes, especially, the scenes where he gets bowtox injections in his face and the suntan scene.

I will admit that I laugh most times I watch it, sometimes I groan because of the stupidity, but I usually have a smile on my face.\n\nThe plot? Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is a washed-up model who has been brainwashed to kill a foreign Prime Minister. Sound stupid? That's because it's supposed to be. We have a handful of male models, all of them with IQs lower than their body fat percentage, and all of them getting into situations that they are not mentally equipped for.\n\nYou can't watch "Zoolander" for its story or its characters, you can only watch it for its inane humour.

It's all based on fact (from Jon Ronson's book) but the concept is so silly that director Grant Heslov and George Clooney (both worked on "Good Night, and Good Luck) really can't help but make fun of it, and there are some good laughs here. Just no real story.\n\nEwan McGregor plays journalist Bob Wilton, a jilted husband who goes to war to forget his backstabbing wife only to end up wiling away in Kuwait. One night he meets Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney), a familiar name to him from a previous interview he did years before about psychic-spies. Lyn was the best in what was called the "New Earth Army", started by Vietnam-Vet Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) in the 80's to create soldiers with super-powers who could prevent conflict. The Army was later dismantled and used for evil purposes by the movie's antagonist Hooper (Kevin Spacey) but Lyn tells Bob he's been re-activated, and has a secret mission to do in Iraq. Bob, thinking Lyn crazy but interesting at the same time, decides to team up with him and go where the action is. Along the way, Lyn tells him stories of others dubbed, "Jedi Warriors." \n\nMost of the movie is flashbacks, beginning with Iraq War 2003 and chronicling all the way back to the beginning of New Age warfare. There are weird and crazy laughs to be had like Lyn's initiation, where Django urges him he will never be a soldier unless he can free the dance. The lines are good too. "We tried invisibility but then worked it down to just not being seen", Lyn tells Bob upon their first meeting. Clooney is perfectly eccentric as a guy who lives by the mindfulness-over-warfare principal and McGregor is a whiny, but solid straight-man. Bridges is also terrific as this free-spirited hippie.

It's all based on fact (from Jon Ronson's book) but the concept is so silly that director Grant Heslov and George Clooney (both worked on "Good Night, and Good Luck) really can't help but make fun of it, and there are some good laughs here. Just no real story.\n\nEwan McGregor plays journalist Bob Wilton, a jilted husband who goes to war to forget his backstabbing wife only to end up wiling away in Kuwait. One night he meets Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney), a familiar name to him from a previous interview he did years before about psychic-spies. Lyn was the best in what was called the "New Earth Army", started by Vietnam-Vet Bill Django (Jeff Bridges) in the 80's to create soldiers with super-powers who could prevent conflict. The Army was later dismantled and used for evil purposes by the movie's antagonist Hooper (Kevin Spacey) but Lyn tells Bob he's been re-activated, and has a secret mission to do in Iraq. Bob, thinking Lyn crazy but interesting at the same time, decides to team up with him and go where the action is. Along the way, Lyn tells him stories of others dubbed, "Jedi Warriors." \n\nMost of the movie is flashbacks, beginning with Iraq War 2003 and chronicling all the way back to the beginning of New Age warfare. There are weird and crazy laughs to be had like Lyn's initiation, where Django urges him he will never be a soldier unless he can free the dance. The lines are good too. "We tried invisibility but then worked it down to just not being seen", Lyn tells Bob upon their first meeting. Clooney is perfectly eccentric as a guy who lives by the mindfulness-over-warfare principal and McGregor is a whiny, but solid straight-man. Bridges is also terrific as this free-spirited hippie. Only the laughs and flashbacks (which feel like a series of sketches) aren't enough to distract from the fact that "Goats" really has no compelling narrative. The forward-moving story in Iraq 2003 has very little momentum. Spacey appears later on again as the villain but the conflict is weak and the movie has more than over-stayed its welcome.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":130167,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.2,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","War"],"datePublished":"2009-11-06","keywords":"satire,army training,iraq war,secret military operation,goat","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Paranormal Activity -- "Paranormal Goats" TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi309003545","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzI0OTM0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDgwMDg5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTgxMzI0OTM0MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNDgwMDg5Mg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A TV trailer for the movie Paranormal Activity.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000191/","name":"Ewan McGregor","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000228/","name":"Kevin Spacey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0381416/","name":"Grant Heslov"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0103694/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0104115/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0184096/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740160/","name":"Jon Ronson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661186/","name":"Peter Straughan"],"duration":"PT1H34M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

But now, older and wiser and with a brand new Blu Ray of the movie, I am finally able to appreciate how clever the film is.\n\nThe story unfortunately IS riddled with 80s Cop Movie clichés and goes through quite a lot of familiar motions. But if you see past that you'll appreciate the immense atmosphere and mood that Ridley Scott piles on. Simply put, Michael Douglas is Nick Conklin, a bad cop (pretty much the exact same character in Basic Instinct) who drag races on his superbike to pay alimony and pinches drug money instead of turning it in for evidence. Enjoying lunch with partner Charlie (Andy Garcia) in a steakhouse in New York's meat-packing district, they just happen to witness a Yakuza execution by wanted Japanese criminal Sato (Yusaku Matsuda, who was dying of cancer during filming and didn't tell anyone). After a quick punch-up and shoot-out they find themselves chaperoning Sato back to Osaka. But when they arrive there he manages to escape, leaving them embarrassed with lots of questions to answer.\n\nNick and Charlie find themselves in a very foreign and intolerant world and recapturing Sato proves to be difficult in many ways. Not the least of which is Japan's alienating culture (from an NYPD point of view) and rigid rules. Nonetheless, Nick is determined to catch Sato and restore his honor.\n\nLike I said, the atmosphere of the film is overwhelming, which is really all the film needs. The clichés and stereotypes don't matter so much when you are involved this much. Hans Zimmer (his first film with Ridley Scott) provides a deeply emotional and very melodic score that'll be rattling around in your head for days. It's a shame it's never had a comprehensive CD release, as it's one of Zimmer's most impressive efforts.\n\nYou could call it a pretty 80s movies, but I still do feel that it holds up pretty well today.

So he decides to accept his bosses challenge; bring an 'idiot' to their annual 'Dinner for Winners'. A competition run by white-collar executives and disguised as a celebration of brilliance in unrecognised individuals. In reality, the meal is simply an opportunity for elitist senior-management types to laugh at some quirky and eccentric members of society. Tim's girlfriend tries to convince him the whole idea is abhorrent. Just as he is beginning to agree with her, he meets Barry (Steve Carell). An IRS worker, with a passion for creating art from taxidermied mice, Barry might just be the perfect man to help Tim win the competition.\n\nThe US version of The Office has shown us that Carell can do awkward better than most and Anchorman proved his capabilities of making stupidity funny. However, his character here is completely unlikeable and, more often than not, irritating. His bowl haircut, glasses and protruding teeth, evoke bad seventies sitcoms. A time when this look would have been a stylists shorthand for 'socially inept'. Paul Rudd, on the other hand, is given little opportunity to make us laugh, playing two-dimensional straight man, Tim. Director Jay Roach's previous franchises (Austin Powers, Meet the Parents/Fockers) may not have been the greatest comedies of the past fifteen years, but delivered as and when expected. The problems with Dinner for Schmucks lie in the pacing and the writing. With a 114 minute runtime, it is simply too long. Entire characters and subplots are superfluous. It also suffers badly from second-act-drag, believing that given enough on-screen time we will somehow empathise with our two leads.\n\nProducer Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat, Bruno), seems to have called in a number of favours from celebrity friends and cast them in every available role. The idea, presumably, is that good performances can boost a weak script into something amusing. Of Course, this is not the case. Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) as avant-garde artiste, Kieran, makes the most of his characters nonsequiturs but only manages to raise a smirk at best. The same cannot be said for David Walliams (Little Britain), whose Swiss, aristocratic character, Mueller, is completely redundant in every way. The only worthy gag in almost two-hours is provided by Chris O' Dowd (The I.T. Crowd) as a blind swordsman. However having only a handful of lines and appearing twenty minutes before the credits roll, its far too little, far too late.\n\nDinner for Schmucks starts with a premise full of comedic opportunities, but spends the next hour and a half ignoring these. The original, a French film from 1998 entitled The Dinner Game, was a social satire focusing on the ridiculous measures the aristocracy will go to amuse themselves. It was full of witty dialogue and, at 80 minutes long, it worked. As often happens, Hollywood seems to have missed the point and delivered a broad and bland remake."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104355,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-13","keywords":"smashing a bottle against a wall,wine,hairy chested male,man wears eyeglasses,remake","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dinner for Schmucks: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3797747481","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who "succeeds" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called "dinner for idiots," which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210895/","name":"Stephanie Szostak"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"}],"duration":"PT1H54M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Director Jay Roach's previous franchises (Austin Powers, Meet the Parents/Fockers) may not have been the greatest comedies of the past fifteen years, but delivered as and when expected. The problems with Dinner for Schmucks lie in the pacing and the writing. With a 114 minute runtime, it is simply too long. Entire characters and subplots are superfluous. It also suffers badly from second-act-drag, believing that given enough on-screen time we will somehow empathise with our two leads.\n\nProducer Sacha Baron Cohen (Borat, Bruno), seems to have called in a number of favours from celebrity friends and cast them in every available role. The idea, presumably, is that good performances can boost a weak script into something amusing. Of Course, this is not the case. Jemaine Clement (Flight of the Conchords) as avant-garde artiste, Kieran, makes the most of his characters nonsequiturs but only manages to raise a smirk at best. The same cannot be said for David Walliams (Little Britain), whose Swiss, aristocratic character, Mueller, is completely redundant in every way. The only worthy gag in almost two-hours is provided by Chris O' Dowd (The I.T. Crowd) as a blind swordsman. However having only a handful of lines and appearing twenty minutes before the credits roll, its far too little, far too late.\n\nDinner for Schmucks starts with a premise full of comedic opportunities, but spends the next hour and a half ignoring these. The original, a French film from 1998 entitled The Dinner Game, was a social satire focusing on the ridiculous measures the aristocracy will go to amuse themselves. It was full of witty dialogue and, at 80 minutes long, it worked. As often happens, Hollywood seems to have missed the point and delivered a broad and bland remake.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":104355,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.9,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy"],"datePublished":"2010-10-13","keywords":"smashing a bottle against a wall,wine,hairy chested male,man wears eyeglasses,remake","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Dinner for Schmucks: Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3797747481","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTczMjMzMzYyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNTUyNjMzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Tim (Rudd) is a rising executive who "succeeds" in finding the perfect guest, IRS employee Barry (Carell), for his boss's monthly event, a so-called "dinner for idiots," which offers certain advantages to the exec who shows up with the biggest buffoon.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0136797/","name":"Steve Carell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0748620/","name":"Paul Rudd","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1210895/","name":"Stephanie Szostak"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005366/","name":"Jay Roach"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031181/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1115862/","name":"David Guion","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1911349/","name":"Michael Handelman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0891554/","name":"Francis Veber"],"duration":"PT1H54M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

However free on terrestrial  yeah, I'll take that! So I settled down to something that immediately set itself out to be fresh, slick and light with a jazzy credit sequence and a glossy (without being OTT) little robbery sequence.  So far so good.

It does get a little heavy and slows the film down and the romance between the two leads doesn't quite wash at every turn, but they toy with each other well enough to keep the interest.\n\nThe climax is pretty cool and clever and it is refreshing that the film never falls into big action set pieces to win over the audience  instead keeping it glossy and slick throughout. It is quite something to find a thriller of sorts that is for grown ups and not teenage boys who NEED something to blow up every so often.  The plot here is robust enough to meet the film's needs but is a little too slick to be examined too closely.  But take this as what it is  slick adult popcorn seller  and you'll enjoy it. It is breezy and enjoyable.\n\nAs Crown, Brosnan exudes charm and smoothness but also is able to put an edge on it to show that Crown is not happy even when he has the world. Russo gives a better performance than I've come to expect from her but is still a little out of place in the film.  She isn't totally convincing and I became annoyed by the regular appearance of her tits in the film  did it really help the film I wondered?  Maybe once it was natural in the scene but the rest just seems like a cry for an audience.  Leary does sterling work as Det McCann, although he isn't funny he is a strong serious actor and carries the role well.  The support cast are all pretty good and Dunaway's cameo adds to the slick feeling rather than standing out awkwardly.\n\nOverall this film will please you if you know what to expect.

It's not a comedy nor a self-parody or horror.\n\n"Welcome to rock bottom!"","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":41556,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":3.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Horror","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2012-07-14","keywords":"piranha,bare breasts,blonde,water park,bikini","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"No. 2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1902617369","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODE5ODU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1MTM3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQyODE5ODU0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTM1MTM3Nw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"After the events at Lake Victoria, the pre-historic school of blood-thirsty piranhas make their way into a newly opened waterpark.

It had a certain freshness to it not only in the way it was told, but also in subject matter itself.

The moment you can't wait to know what will happen at the end of the movie or in the next scene for that matter and at the same time you have to fight with yourself to continue watching - that lets you know this horror flick is actually pretty good.\n\nDefinitely full of flaws and the graphic gore isn't my kind of horror meal. Acting was great and tech credits all round were superb. Ryûhei Kitamura deserves accolades for this horror movie. Maybe not a classic, but given the far fetched material he had to work with it is a triumph.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":63002,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Adventure","Horror"],"datePublished":"2008-10-31","keywords":"photographer,subway,butcher,dismemberment,art gallery","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Midnight Meat Train","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2259812633","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMjczNjY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcyNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjAxMjczNjY5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwOTcyNjYzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Midnight Meat Train - Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005068/","name":"Vinnie Jones"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004753/","name":"Leslie Bibb"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0457565/","name":"Ryûhei Kitamura"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005323/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0173285/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0165062/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1161528/","name":"Jeff Buhler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000850/","name":"Clive Barker"}],"duration":"PT1H38M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>
