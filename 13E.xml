However, the whole story is seen through the boy's eye, so the family's complex political intrigue nor the other boy's family situation aren't fully explained. We see the protagonist, Valerio brings food to someone hiding in the room full of junk, but it's empty as soon as his idyllic family set-up is shattered. When he first meets Christian, he appears out of nowhere, then disappears as soon as his mother calls him. Also when he ditches school with Christian, the school bullies let him go without a fuss. Is Christian imaginary? Or that's how Valerio remembers it. What I like about the most is how their friendship develops. Valerio(Mattia Garaci) and Christian(Francesco Gheghi) are two fresh faces with the latter has slightly more credit as he's little older too. They acted so well together, it's not hard to believe why Valerio desperately need him and vice versa. Since I'm not familiar with Italian cinema(this is my first Italian movie to be honest), Alfonso(Pierfrancesco Favino) is the only actor I'd recognize, but I will pay attention to the future endeavor from these two young talented actors. Valerio is a happy yet lonely boy needs a lot of growing up to do. Christian is a street-wise and confident, yet longing for the love of the family. Their friendship dynamic somewhat reminds me of "Let the right one in"(2008), a vulnerable and sensitive Oskar and confident yet mysterious Eli with a hidden agenda. Ending isn't quite clear and both grown-up boys don't seem to be happy nor successful. That's why this friendship real or imagenary that Valerio longed for must have helped him through out his life.

Pojawia się w samym środku wydarzeń, podczas których niejednokrotnie dochodzi do aktów przemocy. Film stanowi subiektywne spojrzenie na konflikt, który toczy się na polskich ulicach.

The stories have been uniquely Australian to be appreciated by Australian audiences but occasionally they become worldwide hits like Crocodile Dundee. It's the laid-back Aussie humour that international audiences sometimes just don't understand which prevents the majority of Australian films from crossing the cultural barrier. The Dressmaker has been successful at the Australian box office for it features a story where the underdog or misunderstood succeeds along with a story that promotes the Aussie dry wit with dialogue that appeals to the everyday Australian.\n\nMyrtle 'Tilly' Dunnage (Kate Winslet) returns home to rural Australia after spending time abroad developing her fashion designing skills. As a child she was sent to a boarding school in Melbourne by Sergeant Farrat (Hugo Weaving) for she was accused of murdering a boy who bullied her.

With the story being reminiscent of a Clint Eastwood western where the main character comes to town, mingles with the locals then affects their lives one way or another, the music score by David Hirschfelder has some resemblance to a western. It's an exciting score that perfectly sets up the moods of the characters and the theme of the plot. The cinematography by Donald McAlpine also enhances the look of the film, ensuring that the rural town maintains its 'western' appearance.\n\nAlthough clichés do affect the characters and story, the overall quality of the film ensures that most viewers will be entertained. Jocelyn Moorhouse (the director and co-writer) should be chuffed with her film's box office success even though not all critics have praised her work.

Nina Hoos (in another of her enormous performances) is one of those actresses who are ideal to also convey what is not said. Thanks to all that, her violin teacher and violinist is a more complex character than she initially seems.\n\nReview:\n\nAnna Bronsky (Nina Hoos) is a violin teacher at a music academy in Berlin. Against the opinion of other colleagues, she admits young Alexander (Ilja Monti, violinist in real life) as a student in order to prepare him for an audition. From this meeting, some changes will be triggered in Anna's personal environment and in herself.\n\nThe characters in Ina Weisse's film don't talk much; her actions, her gestures are explained by more. The skill and subtlety (and frankness) with which, through a few strokes, the situation of Anna's ties with her luthier husband, her pubescent son who also studies violin, her colleagues, her father and her student are remarkable; we see how the state of affairs also responds to other situations that are revealed and the way in which it does. That relationship with the violin appears as a teacher and as a performer "that she no longer plays" and the possibility of returning to this role.

Nina Hoos (in another of her enormous performances) is one of those actresses who are ideal to also convey what is not said. Thanks to all that, her violin teacher and violinist is a more complex character than she initially seems.\n\nReview:\n\nAnna Bronsky (Nina Hoos) is a violin teacher at a music academy in Berlin. Against the opinion of other colleagues, she admits young Alexander (Ilja Monti, violinist in real life) as a student in order to prepare him for an audition. From this meeting, some changes will be triggered in Anna's personal environment and in herself.\n\nThe characters in Ina Weisse's film don't talk much; her actions, her gestures are explained by more. The skill and subtlety (and frankness) with which, through a few strokes, the situation of Anna's ties with her luthier husband, her pubescent son who also studies violin, her colleagues, her father and her student are remarkable; we see how the state of affairs also responds to other situations that are revealed and the way in which it does. That relationship with the violin appears as a teacher and as a performer "that she no longer plays" and the possibility of returning to this role. Alexander acts as a projection of the best of Anna and perhaps the worst as well; Not for nothing does the original German title (Das Vorspiel) mean prelude. Music as a discipline (sometimes cruel) clearly refers to discipline as a family history and as an eminently German topic and music as a means of relating to other people.\n\nThe film is a lesson in how marital and family problems (and of any kind) should not always be raised by screaming cinema or through marathon parliaments; of how crises coexist with everyday life.\n\nNina Hoos is one of those actresses who are ideal to also transmit what is not said; for them her Anna is a more complex character than she initially seems.

Filmmaker Patrick Brice is building a career on films that leave us with an unsettled, even conflicted feeling on whether we should "like" them or not. He certainly has little time for 'normal' characters, and heroic behavior rarely enters a scene. His latest is written by Sam Bain (PEEP SHOW, and son of Emmy winning director Bill Bain), and it fits perfectly into the offbeat comedy realm of Mr. Brice's previous two CREEP films (with Mark Duplass) and THE OVERNIGHT (2015).\n\nThe film kicks off was an advertisement (in the pre-production stage) for Incredible Edibles, a bio-friendly company that produces edible cutlery (a comical visual). Featured in the ad is the company's ruthless CEO Lucy, played by Demi Moore. Lucy has arranged a Team Building outing for her employees in the mountains of New Mexico. The expedition is led by Brandon (Ed Helms, THE HANGOVER), a Bear Gryllis type who easily evaluates the team's incongruent pieces. After advising against Lucy's demand for the "Advanced" trail, Brandon gives in since 'the check has cleared'. He proceeds to lead the team on a repelling adventure down into a stunning cavern.\n\nJust when it looks like the "advanced" trail was the right call, a cave-in occurs, trapping the team with no escape route, and little food or water. It's at this point when we realize that most of Lucy's management style seems to have originated in a 'get tough' management book from the 1960's. She has no real instinct on how to treat people, and mostly just bullies and tricks them. Ms. Moore's character and performance could easily be viewed as a spoof of her DISCLOSURE role with some uncomfortable laughs. We even get a Harvey Weinstein punchline.\n\nNoticeable right away is the terrific comedic cast. Lucy's team consists of Jess (Jessica Williams, BOOKSMART), Freddie (Karan Soni, DEADPOOL), Derek (Isiah Whitlock Jr, CEDAR RAPIDS), Gloria (Martha Kelly, "Baskets"), Billy (Dan Bakkedahl, SWORD OF TRUST), May (Jennifer Kim, "The Blacklist"), Suzy (Nasim Padrad, ALADDIN), and intern Aidan (Calum Worthy, "American Vandal"). This is an exceptionally talented group of funny people who know how to deliver a line. Some of the funniest moments are the 'throwaway' lines being uttered in between the main dialogue. That's where the real comedy gold is buried, so listen closely.\n\nAlthough the film is a comedy, it also boasts some elements of horror and suspense. Lucy's twisted idealism is the basis for some of this, as is the team's situation as things become more dire (think ALIVE blended with any workplace comedy). We learn the company is teetering on financial failure, and as one might expect in a confined area, workplace resentments and true feelings begin to rear up. The script never quite takes on business satire, focusing instead on personal reactions to a bleak situation. Even Gary Sinise and Britney Spears are included in the comic elements, and while some will find this to be a fitting midnight movie, others will once again be left wondering what to make of Patrick Brice's films. And maybe that's the point.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3169,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2019-09-20","keywords":"male frontal nudity,male nudity,male full frontal nudity,pubic hair,male pubic hair","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3595353113","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhiODdlMzMtY2Q1ZC00MTAyLTkxYzMtYTFhYmE5MTBlMGE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhiODdlMzMtY2Q1ZC00MTAyLTkxYzMtYTFhYmE5MTBlMGE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Lucy (Demi Moore) is the egotistical megalomaniac CEO of Incredible Edibles, America's premier provider of edible cutlery.

Filmmaker Patrick Brice is building a career on films that leave us with an unsettled, even conflicted feeling on whether we should "like" them or not. He certainly has little time for 'normal' characters, and heroic behavior rarely enters a scene. His latest is written by Sam Bain (PEEP SHOW, and son of Emmy winning director Bill Bain), and it fits perfectly into the offbeat comedy realm of Mr. Brice's previous two CREEP films (with Mark Duplass) and THE OVERNIGHT (2015).\n\nThe film kicks off was an advertisement (in the pre-production stage) for Incredible Edibles, a bio-friendly company that produces edible cutlery (a comical visual). Featured in the ad is the company's ruthless CEO Lucy, played by Demi Moore. Lucy has arranged a Team Building outing for her employees in the mountains of New Mexico. The expedition is led by Brandon (Ed Helms, THE HANGOVER), a Bear Gryllis type who easily evaluates the team's incongruent pieces. After advising against Lucy's demand for the "Advanced" trail, Brandon gives in since 'the check has cleared'. He proceeds to lead the team on a repelling adventure down into a stunning cavern.\n\nJust when it looks like the "advanced" trail was the right call, a cave-in occurs, trapping the team with no escape route, and little food or water. It's at this point when we realize that most of Lucy's management style seems to have originated in a 'get tough' management book from the 1960's. She has no real instinct on how to treat people, and mostly just bullies and tricks them. Ms. Moore's character and performance could easily be viewed as a spoof of her DISCLOSURE role with some uncomfortable laughs. We even get a Harvey Weinstein punchline.\n\nNoticeable right away is the terrific comedic cast. Lucy's team consists of Jess (Jessica Williams, BOOKSMART), Freddie (Karan Soni, DEADPOOL), Derek (Isiah Whitlock Jr, CEDAR RAPIDS), Gloria (Martha Kelly, "Baskets"), Billy (Dan Bakkedahl, SWORD OF TRUST), May (Jennifer Kim, "The Blacklist"), Suzy (Nasim Padrad, ALADDIN), and intern Aidan (Calum Worthy, "American Vandal"). This is an exceptionally talented group of funny people who know how to deliver a line. Some of the funniest moments are the 'throwaway' lines being uttered in between the main dialogue. That's where the real comedy gold is buried, so listen closely.\n\nAlthough the film is a comedy, it also boasts some elements of horror and suspense. Lucy's twisted idealism is the basis for some of this, as is the team's situation as things become more dire (think ALIVE blended with any workplace comedy). We learn the company is teetering on financial failure, and as one might expect in a confined area, workplace resentments and true feelings begin to rear up. The script never quite takes on business satire, focusing instead on personal reactions to a bleak situation. Even Gary Sinise and Britney Spears are included in the comic elements, and while some will find this to be a fitting midnight movie, others will once again be left wondering what to make of Patrick Brice's films. And maybe that's the point.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":3169,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.3,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Horror"],"datePublished":"2019-09-20","keywords":"male frontal nudity,male nudity,male full frontal nudity,pubic hair,male pubic hair","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3595353113","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhiODdlMzMtY2Q1ZC00MTAyLTkxYzMtYTFhYmE5MTBlMGE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDhiODdlMzMtY2Q1ZC00MTAyLTkxYzMtYTFhYmE5MTBlMGE4XkEyXkFqcGdeQWFybm8@._V1_.jpg","description":"Lucy (Demi Moore) is the egotistical megalomaniac CEO of Incredible Edibles, America's premier provider of edible cutlery.

It should be noted that, despite the title, this is not a sequel or prequel to Arcand's 1986 film THE DECLINE OF THE AMERICAN EMPIRE. This one is a comedy-crime drama that is as cynical as it is witty, and perhaps as much social commentary as satire. It's yet another rip on capitalism while showing that idealism can work wonders (at least if it's well funded). "Intelligence is a handicap." That's what Pierre-Paul Daoust (played by Alexandre Landry) tells his girlfriend as he breaks up with her in a café. When she points out that he's a delivery driver (similar to UPS), Pierre-Paul riffs on a number of famous writers and philosophers who he claims were dumb as rocks. Her inquiry into Trump being elected President leads to his conclusion, "imbeciles worship cretins". He is the kind of guy that has an answer for everything, and possesses a type of oratory expertise that makes his excuses sound like scientific explanations.\n\nOne day while on his route, he stumbles into a robbery gone way wrong. Two thieves were in the process of stealing gang/mob money (and lots of it) when a shooting broke out. In the immediate aftermath, Pierre-Paul makes the snap decision to toss the two huge bags of cash into the back of his deliver truck and take off. This kicks off a chain of events that includes his crossing paths with Aspasie/Camille (Maripier Morin) a high dollar escort whose website features a quote from "Racine". Pierre-Paul is a Ph.D. in Philosophy, so he takes this as a sign.\n\nShortly after, Pierre-Paul is meeting with Sylvain "the brain" (Arcand regular Remy Girard), a recently released from prison biker who has become an expert on money laundering.

In fact, he regularly doles out money to Quebec's homeless and those down on their luck. He also volunteers regularly at a shelter that feeds those in need. The obvious statement here is pointing out the great divide between the wealthy and the poor.\n\nArcand's film is close to being very good, but falls short in too many areas to reach the height it desires. There is a torture scene that seems totally out of place compared to the tone of the rest of the film, and I refuse to make the link to PRETTY WOMAN - another film where the rich guy wins over the good-hearted sex worker. This film talks about "providence" and just rewards that rarely happen. Is it acceptable to do the wrong thing for the right reasons? Does doing good correct a wrong?

Perhaps it's just because the pairing of Gibson and Downey, Jr. appeals to me. Whatever it is, I found the setup interesting, the comedy funny and the action nicely staged.\n\nI'm tempted to say that its lukewarm reception was down to poor marketing, but I'm not sure that's true. Maybe I just have to accept that I quite like a movie that the majority think is bad.\n\nI don't know what it is with Gibson and 'non-Lethal-Weapon' action comedies, but "Bird on a Wire" seems to be regarded as another commercial failure, and I enjoyed that one too.

It stars Bridget Fonda, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Steven Weber, Peter Friedman and Stephen Tobolowsky. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Luciano Tovoli.\n\nWhen it's revealed that her partner Sam (Weber) has been cheating on her with his ex-wife, Allie Jones (Fonda) kicks him out of the apartment and advertises for a female roommate. She chooses Hedra Carlson (Leigh), who on the surface seems to be the perfect roommate. Smoothly helping Allie through her crisis, a real friendship is formed, but it's not long before Hedra starts to exhibit some dark behaviour patterns ..\n\nThe early 90s saw the "Woman from Hell" back in vogue in mainstream cinema. After the success and publicity of Fatal Attraction (1987), there was a period where you feel that sensible film makers wisely chose to let that particular film disappear from the film lovers memory banks. As it happens, they must have collectively chose 5 years as the cooling off period. For 1992 saw a wave of mad female on the loose pictures released. Led by the publicity gobbling Basic Instinct, films such as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Single White Female put bums on cinema seats and reopened the "Mad Bitch" sub-genre. Of the three, Single White Female grossed the least, which is strange since it's a better movie than the other two.\n\nSchroeder's (Barfly/Reversal of Fortune) movie isn't a complete success, there's not enough development of the main characters and there's some unintentionally funny moments. But when it's good it's real good. Reeling off a number of memorable and often chilling scenes, film is further boosted by the psychological smarts in Roos' (Boys on the Side) screenplay. It helps that Schroeder has a knack for pacing, too, where he neatly simmers the plot until the spill over for the big finale. No disappointment there either, a good combination of genre staples is enhanced in impact by some unexpected character developments, and there's moments of genuine suspense to lure the viewer to the edge of their seat. \n\nIt's also stylishly shot by Schroeder and Tovoli (Suspiria/Tenebrae). Allie's Upper West Side apartment is imposing and expansive, with high ceilings, old time plumbing, a clunky lift and a dingy laundry in the basement. It's a different set-up for such a thriller, no picket fence harmony house or beach side residence, this is bustling New York, big spaces, but as it turns out, that means no hiding place. The boys behind the cameras get the maximum they can from the locale by blending imposing and ominous with grainy veneer and filtered light. On the acting front, the girls put great effort into making their thinly developed characters work, with Leigh doing a good line in progressive instability. While Friedman, Weber and a wonderfully naughty Tobolowsky, make the most of their secondary roles. \n\nOne or two obvious flaws aside, this still rounds out as a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. 7.5/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-08-14","keywords":"female star appears nude,roommate,female nudity,bound and gagged,woman in bathtub","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2455550745","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000403/","name":"Bridget Fonda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000492/","name":"Jennifer Jason Leigh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001836/","name":"Steven Weber"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0775447/","name":"Barbet Schroeder"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661375/","name":"John Lutz"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740400/","name":"Don Roos"}],"duration":"PT1H47M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Led by the publicity gobbling Basic Instinct, films such as The Hand That Rocks the Cradle and Single White Female put bums on cinema seats and reopened the "Mad Bitch" sub-genre. Of the three, Single White Female grossed the least, which is strange since it's a better movie than the other two.\n\nSchroeder's (Barfly/Reversal of Fortune) movie isn't a complete success, there's not enough development of the main characters and there's some unintentionally funny moments. But when it's good it's real good. Reeling off a number of memorable and often chilling scenes, film is further boosted by the psychological smarts in Roos' (Boys on the Side) screenplay. It helps that Schroeder has a knack for pacing, too, where he neatly simmers the plot until the spill over for the big finale. No disappointment there either, a good combination of genre staples is enhanced in impact by some unexpected character developments, and there's moments of genuine suspense to lure the viewer to the edge of their seat. \n\nIt's also stylishly shot by Schroeder and Tovoli (Suspiria/Tenebrae). Allie's Upper West Side apartment is imposing and expansive, with high ceilings, old time plumbing, a clunky lift and a dingy laundry in the basement. It's a different set-up for such a thriller, no picket fence harmony house or beach side residence, this is bustling New York, big spaces, but as it turns out, that means no hiding place. The boys behind the cameras get the maximum they can from the locale by blending imposing and ominous with grainy veneer and filtered light. On the acting front, the girls put great effort into making their thinly developed characters work, with Leigh doing a good line in progressive instability. While Friedman, Weber and a wonderfully naughty Tobolowsky, make the most of their secondary roles. \n\nOne or two obvious flaws aside, this still rounds out as a thoroughly enjoyable thriller. 7.5/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":35396,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Thriller"],"datePublished":"1992-08-14","keywords":"female star appears nude,roommate,female nudity,bound and gagged,woman in bathtub","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2455550745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2I0M2E4NTgtOWQ3ZC00ZGI2LWFlY2ItNjdhNTVjODBkZDE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRodW1ibmFpbC1pbml0aWFsaXplcg@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000403/","name":"Bridget Fonda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000492/","name":"Jennifer Jason Leigh","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001836/","name":"Steven Weber"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0775447/","name":"Barbet Schroeder"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0050868/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1661375/","name":"John Lutz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0740400/","name":"Don Roos"],"duration":"PT1H47M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It is difficult to decide what negative aspect of the movie to discuss as there were so may. In fact, I would speak of a positive aspect if I could find one.\n\nI am a Canadian and cringe whenever I see that I am about to watch a Canadian movie as I have rarely seen one that did not leave me constantly saying "Oh, come on, really?" \n\nWhat bothers me the most is that movies such as these are funded, in part, by tax revenue in the form of government film grants.

It is said that after his friend and rival James Whistler had made a particularly apposite remark, Wilde sighed and said "I wish I had said that!". Whistler's reply was "You will, Oscar, you will". The American film industry has a similar attitude to other people's films to the one that Wilde had to other people's conversation. When the European- particularly the British or French- film industry comes up with a particularly admired film, Hollywood gives a collective sigh and says "We wish we had made that!" You will, Hollywood, you will!\n\nRecent years have seen a glut of remakes of European films, but, admittedly, the results of this creative plagiarism are by no means always bad. The plot of "Sommersby" may have been blatantly lifted from "Le Retour de Martin Guerre", but it is still a good film in its own right. Moreover, I was one of those who thought that Luc Besson's "Nikita" did not lose much in translation when it was remade as the Bridget Fonda vehicle "The Assassin". Sometimes, however, Hollywood manages to come up with a remake that is so inferior to its original model that the two films do not deserve to be mentioned in the same breath. "Diabolique" is a case in point.\n\nHenri-Georges Clouzot's "Les Diaboliques" was one of the classic thrillers of the fifties, as good as the best of Hitchcock's work. Jeremiah Chechik's remake borrows the same basic plot of the original, but transfers it from 1950s France to 1990s America. At the centre is the sadistic headmaster of a private school, a man who brutally mistreats not only the boys in his care but also his wife and even his beautiful mistress. The wife and mistress,tired of his mistreatment, plot together to murder him and to dispose of his body in the filthy school swimming pool, but when the pool is later drained the body has disappeared. As in the original, there is a sudden, surprise twist at the end. Chechik also, however,introduces elements that were not in Clouzot's film. The wife, Mia, here becomes a former nun, who has renounced her vows after losing her faith, but is still haunted by guilt. There is a suggestion of a lesbian relationship between Mia and the mistress, Nicole. Chechik also introduces a major character, in the form of a female detective, with no equivalent in the original film.\n\n"Diabolique" has come in for some sharp criticism, largely because it is a remake of a classic. It is a mediocre film rather than a horrendously bad one, and if we did not have its famous predecessor to compare it with, it would doubtless be seen as just another banal and unsuccessful crime thriller. Nevertheless, I think that the criticism it has attracted is justified. Chechik must have known that one of the perils of remaking a film is that your work will be weighed in the balance against the original, and woe betide you if it is found wanting. And, compared with Clouzot's, Chechik's film is wanting indeed. He lacks the French director's sense of pacing and ability to convey suspense, with the result that his film is slow-moving where the original was brisk and flabby where the original was taut.\n\nI was also disappointed by the acting. Isabelle Adjani can be a fine actress in her own language, as she showed in "La Reine Margot", but I have not been impressed with her in English-language films, and here her character never came to life. Sharon Stone was slightly better as the hard-bitten, sluttish Nicole, but this was not really one of her better performances and did nothing to alter my view that she has not always chosen the best vehicles in which to show off her talents. Chazz Palminteri's headmaster was almost too unpleasant to be believable, and Kathy Bates seemed wasted as the detective. Watching Clouzot's film I was glued to the screen with anticipation as I wondered how the film would end; watching Chechik's, my attention was rather glued to my watch as I wondered when it would end. 4/10","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14083,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1996-10-28","keywords":"stockings,woman on top,dead body in a bathtub,dead body in a car,death in a bathtub","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Diabolique","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi950141209","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000254/","name":"Isabelle Adjani"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154819/","name":"Jeremiah S.

Watching Clouzot's film I was glued to the screen with anticipation as I wondered how the film would end; watching Chechik's, my attention was rather glued to my watch as I wondered when it would end. 4/10","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":4,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":14083,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.5,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Horror","Mystery"],"datePublished":"1996-10-28","keywords":"stockings,woman on top,dead body in a bathtub,dead body in a car,death in a bathtub","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Diabolique","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi950141209","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZTQ5ZWE4MTAtZjFlNi00MjZhLWFhNGUtMzcwZDlmZjIwODY3XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Warner Home Video","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000232/","name":"Sharon Stone","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000254/","name":"Isabelle Adjani","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001590/","name":"Chazz Palminteri"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0154819/","name":"Jeremiah S.

Everything is supposed to go smoothly until one member from the one group draws out a gun and shoots the other because of a previous incident. And all hell breaks.\n\nBen Wheatley's previous film, High Rise, I was not a fan of. High Rise felt too disturbing with heavy-handed messaging while lacking a coherent plot. Free Fire is by far a major improvement with hilarious dialogue, fun and well-written characters and non-stop action. I saw the movie at TIFF today and was pleasantly surprised. Wheatley turns this empty warehouse into a war zone with each of these character taking cover behind various objects and firing blindly. Unlike a lot of generic action movies where characters seem to magically dodge bullets, no one is safe and everyone eventually gets scraped or hit by bullets. This leads to some fun sequences of characters crawling on the ground to get from one cover to the next.\n\nSurprisingly the two standouts are Cillian Murphy and Armie Hammer. Both were surprisingly funny in subtle ways. Sharlto Copley once again plays another weird but yet still hilarious and fun character. I also give strong shout-outs to Sam Riley and Jack Reynor. And Brie Larson is bad-ass as she holds her own weight against her male co- stars.\n\nIf I can say one negative it's that this isn't a movie with a lot of depth. It's not flat but don't expect this to be too much of a complex film. It is just simply about the these 2 trigger-happy groups trying either to kill or survive. It is more of a black comedy/thriller.\n\nFree Fire is definitely one of the most fun and exciting action movies you will see so it is definitely worth a shot to watch once it releases in theatres.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45295,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Comedy","Crime"],"datePublished":"2017-03-31","keywords":"warehouse,shootout,arms dealer,weapons deal,ira","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Free Fire","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3142236697","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjdmZmMzYWEtZGZhMS00NWIwLTlkZGUtOWY5NDQ4ZWMxNGE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZjdmZmMzYWEtZGZhMS00NWIwLTlkZGUtOWY5NDQ4ZWMxNGE5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Free Fire"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1663205/","name":"Sharlto Copley"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0488953/","name":"Brie Larson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2309517/","name":"Armie Hammer"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1296554/","name":"Ben Wheatley"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0197272/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0228888/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0334327/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm4207229/","name":"Amy Jump"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1296554/","name":"Ben Wheatley"}],"duration":"PT1H31M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

In the film, about (what else?) several schemes that happen to go very wrong yet manage to intertwine and (for better or worse) resolve themselves in the end, Ritchie assembles one of the funniest cast of characters in recent memory. Let's see if we can keep this straight:\n\nTurkish (Jason Statham) and his partner Tommy (Stephen Graham) are amateur boxing promoters who, after their premier fighter is wounded, have to find a replacement to fight, or one of the meanest guys in London, Brick Top (Alan Ford), who just happens to run the boxing matches and stands to make a lot of money off of the fight is going to impart his unique brand of justice on them.  Enter Mickey (Brad Pitt) the gypsy who knocked their fighter out, who is an unintelligible drunk with quite a right hook.  Meanwhile, there is a diamond `the size of a fist' that has been stolen by Franky Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro). On his way back from London to America where he is planning on fencing the diamond, trouble ensues, and his fence, Cousin Avi (Dennis Farina) is forced to come to London to find both Franky and the diamond with the help of characters like Bullet Tooth Tony (Vinnie Jones) and Doug `The Head' Denovitz (Mike Reid).  Of course, this can't happen easily, as there are a trio of inept thieves on the trail of the diamond as well as my personal favorite character in the film, Boris `The Blade' Yurinov (Rade Serbedzija)  or as he's better known, `Boris the Bullet Dodger'.  \n\nDid you get all that?  The performances by all of the above actors, and several more that I didn't even mention are all really good, particularly Brad Pitt's.  Every single actor in `Snatch' looks like they are having one hell of a good time working in the film. This story, while complex and with many ramifications from the core plot is absolutely brilliant and a lot of fun.  There are many one-liners that I still personally use four years after first seeing the film, and the intricate weaving of the characters to tell a very simple heist story is just SO good.  `Snatch' would be a great film due to its story alone, but Guy Ritchie's direction is so dead on, the film transcends brilliant and becomes FAN-insert your choice of expletive here-TASTIC.  The slick cinematography, lightning-fast pacing and fun camera angles are right on target with the story.  Add on a great soundtrack that spans Oasis, techno and a traditional-sounding Hasidic song and Ritchie has presented the viewer with an instant classic.  \n\nWhile this was not the first time I had seen the film `Snatch', it was the first time I'd watched the film knowing that I would have to analyze it slightly in order to funnel my thoughts from the film just being `Phenomenal!' to `Phenomenal because ..'  While I can certainly be classified as an unabashed Madonna fan, and have been for the last two decades, I REALLY hope that Ritchie decides to drop his wife from his film work and not continue on the `Swept Away' path, rather, to get back to the work that has earned him well-deserved high praise.

It's currently 2017, and anyone who hasn't learned the 'book to movie' lesson by now needs to finally learn it so that they can also enjoy movies what they are, which is an extra bonus for a book that is well liked by a lot of people. If the movie actually turns out good than all the better, but being more realistic about movies not having to live up to the books they're based on is best thing to do so you don't end up like the rest of these bitter people who leave the movie theater as quickly as possible just to come back home and write a 'nerd'tastic negative one starred review expressing all their deep down inner angst in the most pathetic form possible. Luckily I beat many of them to the punch before they tore this fun and entertaining movie apart, and I did find it entertaining thanx to having zero expectations about it, go ahead and try it next time you go to a similar movie, you'll at least temporarily enjoy yourself. Whining and complaining about trivial things isn't good for you or anyone else anyways.\n\nI thought they did a fairly good job considering all the various challenges that this potential movie presented them, and the fact that it at one point seemed like it may never even get released or get just get much further delayed didn't make the project seem as promising as it did when first hearing about it's production a few years back for the first time. I got my expectations up very high when I first heard about it, but as time went on I would settle for just about anything decent, and 'decent' it sure was, though I'll rate the movie a 10 to make up for one or two reviews from the Negative Nancys of IMDb. I'm happy to see that Sony left this open for a sequel, It's still not a for sure thing if they'll make another, though King seems to think they will, but I'd pay a lot of money to see a movie based of the backstory from 'Wizard and Glass'.\n\nBottom line: Have fun, it's a fun movie whether you have read the books or not. Not a bad choice for the kids either, lot of action, no nudity, and not much cussing from what I recall, (12+ is my guess depending on who you are, ratings can be deceiving).\n\nIf you haven't read the books: Read them if you're an avid reader, you won't regret it, but if you're just an average reader then the 8 books will take you far too long to get thru and you'll probably give up and have wasted a lot of time trying. One trick is just to be disciplined enough to read every single day if possible, and it doesn't even have to be much because it will add up over the course of year, and if you were to read 10 - 15 pages per day every day you'd be able to finish 'The Dark Tower' series within one year. (Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-08-04","keywords":"gunslinger,based on novel,prophetic dream,another world,parallel dimension","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1690417433","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, roams an Old West-like landscape where "the world has moved on" in pursuit of the man in black.

(Quick easy formula: 365 days per year, very roughly 365 pages per book, so 5 pages per day will get you thru 5 books per year, and not difficult at all to make that 40 pages per day, and at the end of the year you will have read 40 BOOKS! Probably more books than you've ready in your life, just got to form the habit first and go from there, keep track with a notebook to stay disciplined if you have to). \n\nOther King suggestions: 'The Shining' Even better than the movie, and possibly underrated because of the movie's popularity, and the fact most people are too lazy to read. \n\n'The Eyes of the Dragon' Walter is a main character, and King once again digs into the darkness of the man's psyche while weaving a great story in Medieval times. \n\n'The Stand' The ultimate apocalyptic adventure with Walter doing what he does best, and the fate of the lives of dozens of different characters all linked to Walter thru their dreams of him, and has 1000 or so pages to all find each other and come together to somehow stop him while avoiding much betrayal and many obstacles along the beaten path that is led and aided by their other dreams of another character who is out to help them find where they need to be going. \n\n'Different Seasons' No, it's not a story about a possessed spice rack) This book includes four novellas (short novels). Most of you will recognize of 2 or 3 of the others as those were all turned into good movies ('The Shawshank Redemption' 'Apt Pupil' and 'The Body' AKA 'Stand By Me'), and just as is usually the case are far superior to the films, and not that the films are bad at all. \n\nIt's just the reality that books always beat movies, it's no contest at all, but movies are a time for us to do something unproductive and be happy while doing it. So don't be like these sad saps who would actually pay for a movie knowing very well that they'll not have a good time. One of the secrets to life is 'to have a good time when you're able to', and if you like to laugh at bad movies that are trying to be serious then you need to finally get yourself on the MST3K and Rifftrax bandwagon.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":134154,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-08-04","keywords":"gunslinger,based on novel,prophetic dream,another world,parallel dimension","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1690417433","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNTkxNTk3NjgxM15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTAyMDY4MjI@._V1_.jpg","description":"The Gunslinger, Roland Deschain, roams an Old West-like landscape where "the world has moved on" in pursuit of the man in black.

However then I am reviewing this film based on this one solely. I thoroughly enjoyed, found the action top notch, well directed and fast paced. I know some of the complaints are due to the thin story but I did not mind too much. Yes a better story could have made the film better but I enjoyed the mother-daughter relationship and how and what they had to do in order to save her, and her whole escape plan.

However then I am reviewing this film based on this one solely. I thoroughly enjoyed, found the action top notch, well directed and fast paced. I know some of the complaints are due to the thin story but I did not mind too much. Yes a better story could have made the film better but I enjoyed the mother-daughter relationship and how and what they had to do in order to save her, and her whole escape plan. Kate Beckinsale is great as Selene as well as the other supporting actors.

Supposedly based on a Korean comic or "manhwa" of same name, the movie "Priest" has NOTHING to do with the original, not even the name of the squinting "strong silent type" main protagonist played by Paul Bettany. Fallen angels, deal with a demon, multiple time frame story lines and all other interesting elements of the original be damned. And perhaps it was for the better since the manhwa's multiple story lines taking place in the Crusades, the old west and the future would just confuse the heck out of everyone.\n\nSo they crafted a whole new premise to appeal to the superficial summer action lover. And the one thing they did right was to give us vampires that do not sparkle in the sunlight. These vampires are all teeth and claws who swarm across the world at night attacking from giant hives, a clear reference to the "Aliens" franchise. These savage beasts have been at constant war with mankind since the dawn of time. A beautifully bloody animated prologue sets the back-story of the film about how mankind's salvation came in the form of the Priests, holy warriors who battled the vampire hordes to near extinction.\n\nThis story revolves around one of the veteran priests who lives among the other downtrodden human inhabitants of a walled dystopian city ruled by the now totalitarian church. When he receives word that his niece was abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, the priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out of the city and rescue her. He is joined on his crusade by his niece's boyfriend, a young trigger-finger wasteland sheriff. But as the duo soon discover, reports of the vampires' return have been greatly understated. With a powerful yet familiar threat is leading the newly reformed vampire hordes, the wayward Priest and his companion must fend off supernatural foes and contend with a group of fellow Priests sent to hunt down their rogue brother.\n\n"Priest" is one cliché storm of a film that commits the cardinal sins of a paper thin plot and forgettable characters thanks to the inexperience of first time writer Cory Goodman. The characters are so forgettable that the writer never even bothered to give many of them names. Paul Bettany's main character is just called "Priest" (It is not his name by the way). There is also "Black Hat" (because he wears a black hat) and "The Priestess" (because she is a female priest) just to name a few. They are less like actual characters and more like blank character archetypes thrown in for plot convenience. Archetypes like Cam Gigandet's hot headed Sheriff Hicks (a second reference to Aliens perhaps?) and Lily Collin's damsel in distress Lucy are just as forgettable even though they do have names.\n\nFailing to provide interesting characters or a good story, the least the producers could do was to deliver a holy hell load of violence with a hard R or M18 rating. Sadly the animated prologue has more blood and guts than the entire film combined since most of the gorier battles take place in darkness or amid dust. The Fights are well choreographed but they tend to be more stylish than practical and sometimes border on illogical. For example, a duel on a high speed train is awesome but none of the combatants ever thought of kicking his opponent off the side? But despite these failings of the flesh, some salvation comes to "Priest" in the form of an excellent production design. From the dark cyberpunk inspired Church city to the post apocalyptic western towns dotting the hostile desert lands, great attention had been paid to make those places as believable as possible. Perhaps most memorable would be the tech on display in the film which includes futuristic motorcycles, tricked out shotguns and the Priests' arsenal of deadly cross-themed blade weapons.\n\nBeyond the props, flawless visual effects and startling CGI, the movie tries as well to inject its narrative with deeper subtexts. The Priests themselves call to mind stories of War veterans who were shunned by society and unable to re-integrate, a theme made most famous in "Rambo: First Blood". The film also makes fun of how some churches twist their religion into a means of control, the hypocritical "holier-than-thou" attitude of modern Christians and their single minded belief that they remain "saved from evil" as long as they worship God. It is not intentionally "anti-Christian" or "anti-catholic". It is more of a clever satire but there will always be the more conservative ones who would cry sacrilege.\n\nAt only 87 minutes long, Priest moves at a brisk pace and at the very least it is not boring. It would no doubt entertain action junkies and fans of post apocalyptic thrillers although more time could have been spent developing the characters or delving into the underlying themes that were addressed. Priest is spectacular but soulless, with a nice looking "body" but barely enough "blood" and "spirit" to satisfy the more sophisticated movie goer.\n\n6.5/10 Rounded down to 6","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":118298,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.7},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"keywords":"vampire,priest,church,warrior,vampire hunter","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Priest: Trailer #3","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4157250841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NjcwNzAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczNTM5NA@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg0NjcwNzAzMV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTczNTM5NA@@._V1_.jpg","description":"A priest disobeys church law to track down the vampires who kidnapped his niece."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0079273/","name":"Paul Bettany"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1544217/","name":"Cam Gigandet"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0702572/","name":"Maggie Q"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0829820/","name":"Scott Stewart"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0010568/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0174505/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0242736/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2309430/","name":"Cory Goodman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2312828/","name":"Min-Woo Hyung"}],"duration":"PT1H27M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

But, as we saw in the final frames, something else was now inhabiting Josh's body and it had strangled paranormal investigator Elise (Lin Shaye) to death. We pick up as the unsuspecting family, including older son Foster (Andrew Astor) and their infant daughter Kali, have moved in with Josh's mother Lorraine (Barbara Hershey) while police investigate Elise's mysterious death in their house. They are barely moved in when supernatural occurrences start to begin again with objects moving, spectral voices, apparitions appearing and dear old dad acting very strange. While Renai tries to deal with the fact that supernatural forces are still with them, Josh tries to convince her all is well and Lorraine decides to team up with Elise's former assistants paranormal investigators Specs (Leigh Whannell who also wrote the screenplay) and Tucker (Angus Sampson) along with one of the original investigators from Josh's childhood haunting, Carl (Steve Coulter) to get down to the bottom of these haunted hi-jinx once and for all. And that is all I will say about the story as, despite some familiar trappings, James Wan (The Conjuring) takes this installment in some clever directions and once again uses the familiar elements very well. We get to know the story behind the evil woman in black seen in the last film and even revisit The Further though, this time it is inventively linked to events in the first film. The pace is a bit slower and more methodical this time round but, since this film is a bit of a mystery as well as haunting, it takes it's time to let the story unfold and secrets be revealed. We still get some spooky scenes but, it is refreshingly mixed in with Lorraine and co's equally goose bump inducing investigation. And what they find is deviously fun. The film is not quite as lively as Insidious part one but, I liked the mystery element and the film earned points with me for using it's return to 'The Further' a bit more clever and less silly then last time. That is the point where the first film lost it's grip on me and here I like how it was done and was with this supernatural chiller up to the spooky end. Wan is a good director and he takes what could have been a ho-hum retread and makes it a fun follow-up. He gets good performances out of all his cast and while I found Patrick Wilson to be bland in both Insidious and The Conjuring, he gets a far more lively performance out of him here. He gets to ham it up a bit and it suits him. The film has some beautiful and creepy visuals, as is Wan's trademark, and Joseph Bishara's score adds some nice atmosphere too. So in conclusion, while the story elements are more familiar; we've seen some of it before and the pace a bit slower, Wan does give us a spooky mystery to add to the paranormal activity and makes much more clever use of his otherworldly 'Further'. He also gives us some clever answers to the questions left by his first Insidious and that all adds up to a spooky fun time at the movies. Also stars House Of The Devil's Joceline Donahue as young Lorraine in some equally clever flashback sequences that tie into the rest of the film in a fun way."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164356,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-09-13","keywords":"police detective,barricading a door,injection in leg,taser,attacked with a knife","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4286163225","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg","description":"A haunted family struggles to uncover a terrifying secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world in Insidious: Chapter 2."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001347/","name":"Barbara Hershey"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314851/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0222021/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Also stars House Of The Devil's Joceline Donahue as young Lorraine in some equally clever flashback sequences that tie into the rest of the film in a fun way.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":164356,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Horror","Mystery","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2013-09-13","keywords":"police detective,barricading a door,injection in leg,taser,attacked with a knife","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"UK Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi4286163225","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTA2ODQzODA0OTZeQTJeQWpwZ15BbWU4MDU4NjU4MTAx._V1_.jpg","description":"A haunted family struggles to uncover a terrifying secret that has left them dangerously connected to the spirit world in Insidious: Chapter 2.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933940/","name":"Patrick Wilson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0126284/","name":"Rose Byrne","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001347/","name":"Barbara Hershey"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0314851/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0222021/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0051618/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1191481/","name":"Leigh Whannell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1490123/","name":"James Wan"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

I would say I had pretty low knowledge in films before I first saw Inside Out (not to say that I'm highly intelligent on films now). I only saw about 200 films prior. I hadn't seen a lot of classic films or even know that film can be an art form just through its camera work among other aspects. So you could say that I can't speak for everyone on my views of this film. And you may be right because opinions are subjective anyway.\n\nThis is my favourite film ever.\n\nLike I said above, I didn't see a lot of films that were deemed as masterpieces at that time. While I still have a lot more to see, I can say that I have caught up with many notable ones now. I've seen The Godfather. I've seen 2001: A Space Odyssey. I've seen Casablanca. I've seen The Shawshank Redemption. I've seen Pulp Fiction. I've seen Lawrence of Arabia.\n\nYet this is still my favourite film of all-time.\n\n80 years from now, this won't change. I felt something extraordinary that will never be felt again. This to me, was a revelation. In honest words I've never experienced something like this before. Only because of Inside Out I was able to kick myself off of a serious depression I had for years, understand the meaning of feeling, feel sympathy to why people act the way they do, be interested in films. In fact, I went and watched the films I mentioned above because of Inside Out.\n\nEver since that late July of 2015 I had been compulsively obsessed with Inside Out to the point where I checked its Oscar chances, IMDb rating, Rotten Tomatoes rating and box office grosses to the point where I felt like I had to stop myself from doing as when seeing anything negative about it just makes feel let down and quite sad about it. It's still something that I'm trying to quit but obviously it's not going that well (ie. this review after one year of the film's release).\n\nInside Out taught me more about depression, empathy, importance of sorrow and interpersonal relationships than any books, talk shows, real-life stories or cat posters could ever dream of. It made me want to become a filmmaker because if this much craft and intelligence can be put in a film, then sign me up to the industry because I want to be a part of it. I don't want to talk about the story or the technical aspects of Inside Out because everyone has talked about it already.\n\nIn the course of less than ten months, I've see this film six times. That's more than any other film during the same period. It's a true testament to its strength and impact on me that's hardly ever going to fade away. I know this isn't the case for everybody. I keep trying to find anybody else who had the same experience as I did walking out of this film for the first time. I yielded only little results and although it brings me down a little since I don't really have anyone else to relate to, I keep telling myself, that no matter what happens to Inside Out in the future, whether its Rotten Tomatoes score or IMDb rating or its overall stature among the general public, whether it gets worse or better for it, this will always be favourite film of all-time. Nothing will change that and I have to let go of everybody else's opinion whether or not they had similar emotional experiences towards it.\n\nYou can vote "not helpful" on this review all you want (which seems to be a recurring case for all positive user reviews here.... I wonder why...) but it's not going to matter anyway.

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment. It makes a pleasant and wholesome change from the usual fare of adolescent dreams."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45255,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1996-12-20","keywords":"architect,united states,usa,mother son relationship,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"One Fine Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3298689305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926165/","name":"Mae Whitman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001355/","name":"Michael Hoffman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002149/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0195234/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0783559/","name":"Terrel Seltzer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800124/","name":"Ellen Simon"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing.

It's a tidy, well made film that draws you into a family battling the mental illness of the mother, who believes she is a sentient android who has malfunctioned. But maybe she is a human who has constructed an elaborate backstory to hide from the pain of being a person who cannot love and who cannot stop beating her on-the-cusp of manhood son. The material clues suggest we are in our time, not some future echoing the television series "Humans," but we are looking at the world through the eyes of the narrator, the mother, and she sees clues about her android origin everywhere. By the time the movie reaches its conclusion, you've been drawn into the madness, the uncertainty of what is human, what is programming, and profound discomfort for the mom and her interior life. The dedication at the end of the film makes it clear the filmmaker wanted to share his experience with his mother and her struggle. He succeeded. The intimate cinematography is a case study in how closeups and lighting can draw an audience into the interior life of the characters. The actors all do a fine job, particularly Marta Krol in the role of the mother and Marieta Zukowska as her peer, counterpart, alter ego or therapist -- when you are in psychosis, those around you play many roles.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4},"genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-03-27","actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2067989/","name":"Marta Król"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2029225/","name":"Marcin Sztabinski"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2346424/","name":"Marieta Zukowska"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0734708/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0767135/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0778711/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"}],"duration":"PT1H15M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

 --- Description: Jestem REN: Directed by Patricia Ryczko. With Marta Król, Marcin Sztabinski, Marieta Zukowska, Janusz Chabior. We meet a mother quietly obsessing over the sudden change in her family's life. Gradually we learn she is an android, and has suffered a glitch. The company puts her into therapy in order to assess the damage. She comes to see that her android self is her own fantasy.

It's a tidy, well made film that draws you into a family battling the mental illness of the mother, who believes she is a sentient android who has malfunctioned. But maybe she is a human who has constructed an elaborate backstory to hide from the pain of being a person who cannot love and who cannot stop beating her on-the-cusp of manhood son. The material clues suggest we are in our time, not some future echoing the television series "Humans," but we are looking at the world through the eyes of the narrator, the mother, and she sees clues about her android origin everywhere. By the time the movie reaches its conclusion, you've been drawn into the madness, the uncertainty of what is human, what is programming, and profound discomfort for the mom and her interior life. The dedication at the end of the film makes it clear the filmmaker wanted to share his experience with his mother and her struggle. He succeeded. The intimate cinematography is a case study in how closeups and lighting can draw an audience into the interior life of the characters. The actors all do a fine job, particularly Marta Krol in the role of the mother and Marieta Zukowska as her peer, counterpart, alter ego or therapist -- when you are in psychosis, those around you play many roles.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":74,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.4,"genre":["Drama","Sci-Fi","Thriller"],"datePublished":"2020-03-27","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2067989/","name":"Marta Król","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2029225/","name":"Marcin Sztabinski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2346424/","name":"Marieta Zukowska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0734708/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0767135/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0778711/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2253296/","name":"Patricia Ryczko"],"duration":"PT1H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Przed swoją śmiercią odpowiedział na pytanie, czy w getcie była miłość i jak ona się przejawiała. Film jest odpowiedzią na książkę Marka Edelmana i Pauli Sawickiej o tym samym tytule, która zawiera wspomnienia mężczyzny. Przy jego scenariuszu współpracowała Agnieszka Holland, a jego fabularyzowane sceny współreżyserował Andrzej Wajda.</desc>

But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.\n\nEvery single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.\n\nOverall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.\n\nPawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.\n\nHervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.\n\nThe scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.\n\nGreat film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars.

This plot is just one notch above that goofy Soul Plane from a few years back and a few below Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail. A better script, more realistic characters and a more serious touch the movie might be average. Paula Patton is beautiful as always that you can't deny and Ty Diggs is an accomplished actor but they need to move on into some more serious roles. My advise is don't waste your time on this one.

It seemed more like an corny SNL skit that lasts over an hour. I had the movie already figured out in the first 15 minutes and had to endure the rest of the flick. This plot is just one notch above that goofy Soul Plane from a few years back and a few below Tyler Perry's Madea Goes to Jail. A better script, more realistic characters and a more serious touch the movie might be average. Paula Patton is beautiful as always that you can't deny and Ty Diggs is an accomplished actor but they need to move on into some more serious roles. My advise is don't waste your time on this one. I still can't believe I didn't walk out.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":2,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9138,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.1,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Comedy","Romance"],"datePublished":"2013-09-27","keywords":"gay character,woman wears only a man's shirt,marriage proposal,karaoke bar,karaoke","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1964549657","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTEzOTg2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY4MzA1OQ@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ5NTEzOTg2Ml5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNzY4MzA1OQ@@._V1_.jpg","description":"Pledging to keep herself from being the oldest and the only woman in her entire family never to wed, Montana embarks on a thirty-day, thirty-thousand-mile expedition to charm a potential suitor into becoming her fiancÃ©.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1745736/","name":"Paula Patton","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004875/","name":"Taye Diggs","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0779325/","name":"Jill Scott"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0847859/","name":"David E.

Some folks in his homeland (including some politicians) have criticized his films for exposing these problem....though many film buffs have loved these same films. It's surprising, then, when you watch "The Truth"....not just because it has an all French and American cast but because unlike his films such as "Like Father, Like Son" and "Shoplifters", he DOES pull his punches and more often than not avoids pushing boundaries! As a result, my daughter and I enjoyed the film but were also very disappointed.\n\nThe film stars Catherine Deneuve and Juliet Binoche as a self-absorbed mother and her frustrated daughter during a visit. And, amazingly, by the end of the story, nothing much happens....few sparks and the big confrontation scene you expect (because the daughter deservedly resents her mother) never really materialize and the mother somehow receives absolution though she did little to merit it....again, NOT like what you'd expect in a Hirokazu Koreeda movie.\n\nOverall, the acting was good but the story itself a bit flat.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6162,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-11","keywords":"aging actress,acting,tortoise,dog,title is not in english","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1405009689","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjlmODk2MjktMWNmNC00M2U1LWJkOTUtMjUwNGJiMDVhZDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjlmODk2MjktMWNmNC00M2U1LWJkOTUtMjUwNGJiMDVhZDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000366/","name":"Catherine Deneuve"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0466153/","name":"Hirokazu Koreeda"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029856/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0567389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0705123/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0466153/","name":"Hirokazu Koreeda"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7408787/","name":"Ken Liu"}],"duration":"PT1H46M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Some folks in his homeland (including some politicians) have criticized his films for exposing these problem....though many film buffs have loved these same films. It's surprising, then, when you watch "The Truth"....not just because it has an all French and American cast but because unlike his films such as "Like Father, Like Son" and "Shoplifters", he DOES pull his punches and more often than not avoids pushing boundaries! As a result, my daughter and I enjoyed the film but were also very disappointed.\n\nThe film stars Catherine Deneuve and Juliet Binoche as a self-absorbed mother and her frustrated daughter during a visit. And, amazingly, by the end of the story, nothing much happens....few sparks and the big confrontation scene you expect (because the daughter deservedly resents her mother) never really materialize and the mother somehow receives absolution though she did little to merit it....again, NOT like what you'd expect in a Hirokazu Koreeda movie.\n\nOverall, the acting was good but the story itself a bit flat.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":6,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":6162,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2019-10-11","keywords":"aging actress,acting,tortoise,dog,title is not in english","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Bande-annonce [OV]","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1405009689","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjlmODk2MjktMWNmNC00M2U1LWJkOTUtMjUwNGJiMDVhZDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjlmODk2MjktMWNmNC00M2U1LWJkOTUtMjUwNGJiMDVhZDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRyYW5zY29kZS13b3JrZmxvdw@@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000366/","name":"Catherine Deneuve","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000300/","name":"Juliette Binoche","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000160/","name":"Ethan Hawke"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0466153/","name":"Hirokazu Koreeda"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0029856/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0567389/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0705123/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0466153/","name":"Hirokazu Koreeda","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7408787/","name":"Ken Liu"],"duration":"PT1H46M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Director George Roy Hill took a page from his successful western, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, and teamed Paul Newman and Robert Redford once again, this time for an Academy Award four star movie about con men.\n\nThe intricate saga of The Sting is set in 1936 Chicago. It tells the story of grifters, Henry Gondorff and Johnny Hooker, played by Paul Newman and Robert Redford, respectively. They con the bad guy, Doyle Lonnegan, played by Robert Shaw. And at every turn, they con the audience as well.\n\nThe poker game is five card draw ('straight poker' in the film) and is set on a train traveling from New York to Chicago. Newman and Redford are on the train along with Shaw. The game has been set up by Shaw with the cooperation of the conductor. We don't know how Newman and Redford know exactly what day and what train Shaw is taking from New York to Chicago, but that is beside the purpose of our discussion. Shaw is a known card cheater, but Newman will prove to be a better one. Once again the holy game of poker will be sullied by the movies. This time, we'll love every minute of it.\n\nNewman arranges to get himself invited to the poker game, through the conductor. He arrives sober, but apparently inebriated. It is the perfect act, consummately played in a boozy, needling performance by Paul Newman. \n\nShaw's character is a known cold decker (a 'cold deck' is a deck introduced surreptitiously into the game with hands pre-arranged to break one of the players)' and Newman will have to play over the top of the cold deck when it is placed into the game.\n\nOne of the subtleties of the event is missed by most viewers. Newman must ready himself to overcome the cold deck. During the play of hands, we see Newman hold the cards close to his vest and, at least once, his cards disappear briefly below table level, out of sight, and back again. Newman knows Shaw cold decks middle cards against low cards, and so Newman is gathering and holding out jacks.\n\nNewman immediately insults Shaw upon arrival and continues to heckle him throughout the play of the game, thus making sure Shaw will cold deck the game to teach the upstart drunk a lesson. When Shaw goes to the men's room to arrange to fix the cold deck, Newman knows the time has come. (In real life, cold decks were nearly always arranged in men's rooms. They should have had a dedicated stall marked 'coolers made here'.)\n\nThe game is three handed at this point. Shaw will bring the cold deck in when he cuts the cards for the dealer to his left. In filming the cold decking, the camera shows a pair of hands over the deck, then there's a cut in the continuity. Then the camera goes immediately back to the deck and we see the hands with the warm deck going to a handkerchief in Shaw's lap, leaving the cold deck on the table. I guess it would have been hard to do in one long shot.\n\nThe detail is interesting during the dealing of the cold deck. Newman is fussing with his cigar and poking behind his vest, implying something is happening. But we never see Newman with hand positions that could be holding out cards.\n\nNewman is dealt trip threes and Shaw is dealt a pair of nines. The third player is the dealer and he is out of the hand. Newman draws two cards and gets his four threes with the six of hearts. Shaw draws three cards and gets his four nines with the ten of spades.\n\nThe planning of the arranged cold deck is well done and probable. After the cards are dealt, the cards on top of the deck are, in order, a three, the six of hearts, two nines and the ten of spades. It doesn't matter whether Newman draws one or two cards, he'll make his four threes and, in either case, Shaw, in drawing three cards, will make his four nines.\n\nNow, here's the unlikely trick. Newman must change the hand with four threes for a hand with four jacks. It would be easiest to hold out an entire hand of four jacks and a fifth card and switch five card hands. But Newman switches only the four threes for the four jacks he's held out and he keeps the six of hearts. That is much harder to do and less likely would be the method chosen. Newman also takes the chance that Shaw won't have one of the legitimate jacks in his hand with the four nines, but in having to play over the top of the cold deck, that gamble is unavoidable.\n\nShaw's problem is that he can't call Newman for card manipulation because Shaw has an audience, the other players and the conductor. After Newman leaves the cabin, Shaw says to his lackey, 'What was I supposed to do? Call him for cheating better than me, in front of the others?'\n\nShaw was able to get $10,000 more in chips during a hand in a table stakes game. But that was okay with Newman.\n\nThe film shows Shaw wiping his face with a handkerchief during the play of the hand, implying he has disposed of the warm deck. However, we never see Newman clean up. So, when he leaves the poker cabin, one deck is short four jacks, the other deck has four extra jacks, and Newman still has four threes behind his vest somewhere. Whoever the conductor gives the decks to next, will have a few surprises.\n\nDespite its faults, the poker scene from The Sting is the most fun filled, greatest directed, best acted, and most involved offering in cheating poker film history. And it was made over thirty years ago.\n\nSilver Dollar Sam NothingWild.com"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":252642,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1973-12-25","keywords":"con,con man,illegal activity,playing golf,con artist","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Sting","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2717122841","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000602/","name":"Robert Redford"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001727/","name":"Robert Shaw"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001351/","name":"George Roy Hill"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019166/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911486/","name":"David S.

But Newman switches only the four threes for the four jacks he's held out and he keeps the six of hearts. That is much harder to do and less likely would be the method chosen. Newman also takes the chance that Shaw won't have one of the legitimate jacks in his hand with the four nines, but in having to play over the top of the cold deck, that gamble is unavoidable.\n\nShaw's problem is that he can't call Newman for card manipulation because Shaw has an audience, the other players and the conductor. After Newman leaves the cabin, Shaw says to his lackey, 'What was I supposed to do? Call him for cheating better than me, in front of the others?'\n\nShaw was able to get $10,000 more in chips during a hand in a table stakes game. But that was okay with Newman.\n\nThe film shows Shaw wiping his face with a handkerchief during the play of the hand, implying he has disposed of the warm deck. However, we never see Newman clean up. So, when he leaves the poker cabin, one deck is short four jacks, the other deck has four extra jacks, and Newman still has four threes behind his vest somewhere. Whoever the conductor gives the decks to next, will have a few surprises.\n\nDespite its faults, the poker scene from The Sting is the most fun filled, greatest directed, best acted, and most involved offering in cheating poker film history. And it was made over thirty years ago.\n\nSilver Dollar Sam NothingWild.com","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":252642,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"1973-12-25","keywords":"con,con man,illegal activity,playing golf,con artist","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Sting","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2717122841","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjM5ZDllM2QtZjg2MS00NjA1LWE2ZTEtNmU2MTBkM2U2MDNhXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Universal Studios Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000056/","name":"Paul Newman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000602/","name":"Robert Redford","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001727/","name":"Robert Shaw"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001351/","name":"George Roy Hill"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0019166/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0911486/","name":"David S.

It has scenes as quick witted - and often as wackily off-kilter! - as the adults must be just in order to survive their average day. Stir love into this mess of two increasingly desparate modern lives and you get a miraculous souffle of a film, at once sharp and sweet.\n\nNo scene is laboured, no point is telegraphed, and - phenomenally for a modern American film - neither kids nor kittens are allowed to smother the audience in the nauseous layers of cutesiness that are usually applied. The scene with the analyst, where Clooney must obscure his account of his sex-life in an ever-more-surrealistic periphrasis involving iced cakes and fish, since his little daughter has to accompany him into the presumably crecheless analyst's surgery, and her dad is embarassed to expose her to such adult matters as he is obliged to reveal during the session, is a scene which is a model of intelligent and stylish comedy writing. The dialogue of both himself and his analyst finally founders on the increasingly strained comparisons and metaphors being attempted. The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment. It makes a pleasant and wholesome change from the usual fare of adolescent dreams."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45255,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1996-12-20","keywords":"architect,united states,usa,mother son relationship,friendship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"One Fine Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3298689305","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926165/","name":"Mae Whitman"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001355/","name":"Michael Hoffman"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002149/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0195234/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0783559/","name":"Terrel Seltzer"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800124/","name":"Ellen Simon"}],"duration":"PT1H48M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The analyst begins to construct an alarmingly kinky lifestyle for his client out of what he takes to be Freudian suggestions - but which are, as noted, merely the product of old-fashioned seemliness - whereupon Clooney is forced to bring the whole towering edifice back down to earth when his version of the morning's business with the goldfish gets mixed up in the heady brew of symbolism: 'No. I mean fish. You know - 'Fish' fish?'\n\nThe humour is all good, never strained, and beautifully played by all the principals, including the wonderfully un-sentimentalised children. The transformation, stage-by-stage, of the harsh mutual competition and resentment that exists at first between these harassed adults, into an exhausted truce, by way of barely-restrained irritation, grudging gratitude, reluctant respect, and growing affection, is handled with considerable dramatic finesse throughout.\n\nTo produce the unlikely union of such an ill-assorted pair under such utterly unpropitious and unromantic circumstances is a comedic challenge of considerable proportions, and the makers of this film do an excellent job to bring it off at all. The spirits of Grant and Hepburn - even Beatrice and Benedict - are not too far away.\n\nThe only disappointment is to see how many people in the audience have gone home just as sour as when they arrived, judging from some of the comments here. But then, love curdles in any mean-spirited breast.\n\n One particularly admires the fact that, at its conclusion, the film's romantic clincher - when the tired-out couple have to settle for just falling asleep together, despite their by now clearly desparate need for each other, - insists upon the importance of exactly this: Love, rather than merely lust, as the basis for an adult relationship.\n\nJust occasionally, Hollywood still lets us have a grown-up entertainment. It makes a pleasant and wholesome change from the usual fare of adolescent dreams.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":45255,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.5,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"1996-12-20","keywords":"architect,united states,usa,mother son relationship,friendship","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"One Fine Day","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3298689305","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjJjMTlhOGYtZGM4MC00MjFiLTliMjEtYWI0NDdhNmQzNmIwXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000201/","name":"Michelle Pfeiffer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0926165/","name":"Mae Whitman"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001355/","name":"Michael Hoffman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0017497/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002149/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0195234/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0783559/","name":"Terrel Seltzer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0800124/","name":"Ellen Simon"],"duration":"PT1H48M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

    <desc lang="pl">Zmarły w 2009 roku Marek Edelman był ostatnim przywódcą powstania w getcie warszawskim. Przed swoją śmiercią odpowiedział na pytanie, czy w getcie była miłość i jak ona się przejawiała. Film jest odpowiedzią na książkę Marka Edelmana i Pauli Sawickiej o tym samym tytule, która zawiera wspomnienia mężczyzny. Przy jego scenariuszu współpracowała Agnieszka Holland, a jego fabularyzowane sceny współreżyserował Andrzej Wajda.</desc>

It takes you right into the heart of the darkest period in the 20th century, right into the heart of a Holocaust - Krakow in Poland, where the famous Plaszow ghetto was located and where the trains were loaded for Auschwitz. It's also a very intimate and moving portrait of a true friendship between two great artists. We get to see incredible suffering but also have a chance to witness a fantastic sense of humour, which obviously is the best way to deal with such sad memories. We can also now understand why Polanski refused to film "The Shindler's List" and instead filmed "The Pianist". We should be very grateful to film authors.

It takes you right into the heart of the darkest period in the 20th century, right into the heart of a Holocaust - Krakow in Poland, where the famous Plaszow ghetto was located and where the trains were loaded for Auschwitz. It's also a very intimate and moving portrait of a true friendship between two great artists. We get to see incredible suffering but also have a chance to witness a fantastic sense of humour, which obviously is the best way to deal with such sad memories. We can also now understand why Polanski refused to film "The Shindler's List" and instead filmed "The Pianist". We should be very grateful to film authors. PS - People who give this film a low rating obviously have not seen it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"genre":["Documentary"],"datePublished":"2021-08-20","keywords":"childhood","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000591/","name":"Roman Polanski","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1058543/","name":"Ryszard Horowitz","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm7061785/","name":"Bronislawa Horowitz Karakulska"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8896961/","name":"Mateusz Kudla","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9896989/","name":"Anna Kokoszka-Romer"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0701909/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9896989/","name":"Anna Kokoszka-Romer","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm8896961/","name":"Mateusz Kudla"],"duration":"PT1H15M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.\n\nThe scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.\n\nGreat film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars.

The plot is awesome and intriguing, it's beautifully confusing. Although there's no clear explanation for what's going on and everyone will get it from their own perspective, you'll just love and enjoy what's going on and you'll feel involved all the time. Black Bear is definitely a movie that will affect you and you'll keep thinking about it for a long time after the credits start rolling. Performances by the three leads are nice. Cinematography is beautiful with many physical beauty. One of the best thrillers this year.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":9116,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-12-04","keywords":"swimsuit,bear,jealousy,infidelity,interracial kiss","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1770307865","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E3NjdiYWItMzJhOS00MTM5LTlkYTEtZjFlZmIwY2Q3ZDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2E3NjdiYWItMzJhOS00MTM5LTlkYTEtZjFlZmIwY2Q3ZDFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQWRvb2xpbmhk._V1_.jpg","description":"Black Bear is an intriguing and unexpected comedic thriller starring Aubrey Plaza, Christopher Abbott and Sarah Gadon.

Very well directed.","reviewBody":"Little gem. A very well directed and acted movie which intrigues the viewer as it moves from a strong rather melodramatic start to a more subtle and unspoken development. As the movie departs from poignant scenes to embrace realism, characters leave stereotipes and come to the truth that we are all humans with feelings, fears and hopes. Differences are in the surface. Great photography which magnify the beauty of the city of Trieste.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":490,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6,"genre":["Drama"],"datePublished":"2020-09-10","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0309348/","name":"Alessandro Gassmann","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5077317/","name":"Sara Serraiocco","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm9811589/","name":"Luka Zunic"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1188291/","name":"Mauro Mancini"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0352113/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0091302/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0656830/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm11894044/","name":"Davide Lisino","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1188291/","name":"Mauro Mancini"],"duration":"PT1H36M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Based in Rio de Janiero, the film blends the vibrant colors of the area with the traditional and restrictive Latin American family expectations of the 1950's.\n\nThe story spans 5 or 6 decades, and when we first meet sisters Euridice and Guida, it's clear they share a tight emotional bond that goes deeper than blood. Though their personalities differ greatly, they are both ahead of their time and out of step with the conventions of the era. Euridice (a strong performance by Carol Duarte) longs for independence and aspires to be a concert pianist after a hoped-for Conservatory in Vienna, while Guida (a powerhouse Julia Stockler) is a dreamer seeking true love, and whose party girl ways must be kept hidden from their conservative father.

Her father rejects his pregnant daughter since, in his eyes, she has disgraced the family. The parents mislead Guida about her sister's whereabouts, so Guida assumes Euridice is off at conservatory fulfilling her dreams. This sets Guida off on her own solitary path.\n\nIn actuality, Euridice has married and experienced one of the worst ever wedding nights, featuring what is likely cinema's most unsexy bathroom lovemaking scene. There is an element of horror films to this segment of the film, as the sisters are living their worst nightmares, while being separated from each other ... unable to communicate. The male-dominated Latin culture and family traditions prevent their mother from 'disobeying' the father's order, so the cruel lie continues as the sisters unknowingly live their lives within the same town.

Guida (now Gisele) befriends a wise former prostitute Filomena (an excellent Barbara Santos) who becomes her mentor in poverty. Euridice tries to make the best of her situation while keeping her dream alive. Mostly what we have is a tragic story without one specific tragedy - other than the daughter spurned by her father. There are so many moments of pain and frustration, with undelivered mail being among the worst. The film is beautifully shot by cinematographer Helene Louvart, and it reminds us that 'life happens', and it's not all love and Bach.

It becomes easier to tolerate the frustrations of the real world and to accede to the demands of reality if one can restore himself at intervals in a world where the deepest wishes can achieve imaginary gratification." Selma H. Fraiberg, Child Psychologist \n\nStephen Chow is a big star in Asia, and his fantasy CJ7 is a big hit. Although I'm not sure American audiences will return a Jackie-Chan-like box office bundle for this E. T. knock off, I do know that allegorical, off-the-wall, science fictional kid flicks like this are rare and fun if you give yourself into their absurdity.\n\nSome critics liken Chow to Jerry Lewis; Chow is much more imaginative than Lewis, relying as Chow does less on slapstick and more on the intriguing impulses of a small Chinese boy, whose poverty serves as a catalyst for his life-defining experience discovering an outer space dog-like companion and his own love for a hapless but adorable father. Overcoming the bullying about his status in the playground and finding love in a classmate, teacher, father, and alien are enough for most of us in a lifetime.\n\nChow handles the eccentric material with ease as he minimizes CGI and marginalizes himself for the impressive talents of young Jiao Xu (actually a girl) as the growing-up-fast Dickey. The film comes close to Lassie-like sentiment but never fully settles in that territory. The requisite moralizing, in this case about the importance of love and education, is not suffocating, and the imaginative dream sequences are just that: out-there fantasies of a boy who needs a faithful toy and loving father.\n\nThe Yangtze River is known as "Changjiang" in Mandarin, therefore the shortened "CJ," which is also the name for Chinese activities such as space probes. No matter, for these multiple references serve to emphasize the lighter than air world of a man, his boy, and a space dog.\n\nE. T. has come home again in a different form with much less fanfare, yet every child has to love the anarchy."},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15365,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-01-30","keywords":"father son relationship,bullying,lollipop,china,cockroach","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. trailer: CJ7","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1991377177","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NzE5ODg5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkwMjczMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NzE5ODg5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkwMjczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the U.S. theatrical trailer for CJ7, directed by Stephen Chow."},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2514879/","name":"Yuqi Zhang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2922341/","name":"Jiao Xu"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020819/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049799/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0463674/","name":"Vincent Kok"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874683/","name":"Kan-Cheung Tsang"}],"duration":"PT1H28M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

It becomes easier to tolerate the frustrations of the real world and to accede to the demands of reality if one can restore himself at intervals in a world where the deepest wishes can achieve imaginary gratification." Selma H. Fraiberg, Child Psychologist \n\nStephen Chow is a big star in Asia, and his fantasy CJ7 is a big hit. Although I'm not sure American audiences will return a Jackie-Chan-like box office bundle for this E. T. knock off, I do know that allegorical, off-the-wall, science fictional kid flicks like this are rare and fun if you give yourself into their absurdity.\n\nSome critics liken Chow to Jerry Lewis; Chow is much more imaginative than Lewis, relying as Chow does less on slapstick and more on the intriguing impulses of a small Chinese boy, whose poverty serves as a catalyst for his life-defining experience discovering an outer space dog-like companion and his own love for a hapless but adorable father. Overcoming the bullying about his status in the playground and finding love in a classmate, teacher, father, and alien are enough for most of us in a lifetime.\n\nChow handles the eccentric material with ease as he minimizes CGI and marginalizes himself for the impressive talents of young Jiao Xu (actually a girl) as the growing-up-fast Dickey. The film comes close to Lassie-like sentiment but never fully settles in that territory. The requisite moralizing, in this case about the importance of love and education, is not suffocating, and the imaginative dream sequences are just that: out-there fantasies of a boy who needs a faithful toy and loving father.\n\nThe Yangtze River is known as "Changjiang" in Mandarin, therefore the shortened "CJ," which is also the name for Chinese activities such as space probes. No matter, for these multiple references serve to emphasize the lighter than air world of a man, his boy, and a space dog.\n\nE. T. has come home again in a different form with much less fanfare, yet every child has to love the anarchy.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":15365,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2008-01-30","keywords":"father son relationship,bullying,lollipop,china,cockroach","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"U.S. trailer: CJ7","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1991377177","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NzE5ODg5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkwMjczMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ1NzE5ODg5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNjkwMjczMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"This is the U.S. theatrical trailer for CJ7, directed by Stephen Chow.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2514879/","name":"Yuqi Zhang","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2922341/","name":"Jiao Xu"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0020819/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0049799/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0159507/","name":"Stephen Chow","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0463674/","name":"Vincent Kok","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874683/","name":"Kan-Cheung Tsang"],"duration":"PT1H28M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. "It was so great," she said. "You really felt like you were on the ship." "Nonsense," I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, "you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested." "Well, maybe," thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. "OK," I thought, "I'll give it a look see." I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.\n\nWhere to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost "you are there" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect "t" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of "My Heart Goes On."\n\nProblems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. \n\nA minor quibble, though.

When calling a client from a phone booth in the hope of getting her to a hotel.  When he hangs up the phone rings and he answers to what he assumes is a prank call.  However the caller reveals more and more about Stu exposing his lies.  When Stu tries to leave the caller reveals that he has Stu pinned down with a sniper rifle and the death of a man by the booth proves it.  The police arrive and surround Stu while the caller continues his game.\n\nEveryone knows that it had a small budget, a shooting window of just over a week and that it was made years ago and shelved as Farrell's star power increased and real life terrorist attacks and snipers came and went in the media and the mind of the American public.  So I'll not dwell on that and instead talk of the film!  The pitch was enough to get me interested  `man is held in phone box by sniper'  sounds great!  I really wanted to see this film but was put off by the trailer, but not of the films I saw wrong in the trailer were to the detriment of the film as over 80-odd minutes it really runs like a race horse.\n\nStarting with humour and a free-flowing pace it turns sinister early on but keeps the pace.  In terms of plot it has many good twists and turns that will keep you interested and on the edge of your seat.  The only issue for me was accepting why the sniper was doing it and how he was able to get access to the equipment he would have needed as well as the information  not to mention the WILL to do it!  Also little things bugged me, but the film carries itself over these obstacles well enough and reservations are soon forgotten.  It sounds simple but the simple ideas work best and, although low on action (sorry, teen boys!) it is driven by dialogue and simply not knowing what will come next.\n\nThe direction helps the film by constantly moving and using split screens etc to give the impression that a lot is going on at once  again making the film feel like it has a fast pace.  It feels a little gimmicky (especially now that we've had 2 series of 24 doing the same thing) but it works regardless.  I wrote in an old review (8mm I think) that I would never pay to see a Joel Schumacher film ever again, and I DIDN'T pay to see Phone Booth!  However I was surprised because he didn't ruin it!  He did a good job  yes,  you heard me!  His usual excesses seem to have been controlled by a good producer and editing team and the film works  much to my surprise and relief!\n\nFarrell may not be a bona-fide Hollywood star yet but he takes the task of being onscreen for almost the whole film and runs with it.  He makes a comically cruel character someone that reveals himself to be a loser but never loses the audience  and that takes talent.  Sutherland's voice on the trailer didn't work for me (too normal and slow) but in the film he is excellent, like the director said, no-one else could have done the role, he is right for it.  Whitaker makes up the third lead and he holds his corner well.\n\nIt may not be without the odd flaw but this film manages to be simple, gripping and very effective.

Rob asks at the very beginning of the film and it is here that Rob decides to investigate just how he is at fault to the 5 all time greatest break ups in his love life a la The Top 5s he and his co-horts in crime habitually categorize all things pertinent to music.  What follows is a laugh-filled introspection of the heart on its sleeve and its tongue sharply in cheek as to Rob's quest of finding all his faults and foibles in hope of wooing back his recent romantic dismissal that includes 5 prototypes of all heterosexual men: The First Kiss/Crush; The Adolescent Urgency/Loss of Virginity, The Woman Out of His League; The Rebound Best Friend/Possible Soul Mate and finally, The One True Love He Isn't Even Aware Of.\n\nThe approach may seem old hat and gimmicky (Cusack breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly into the camera) yet it isn't intrusive but enlightening into what the hero is really thinking and more importantly why.  Surrounded by a truly winning cast, Cusack shines once again as a likable average guy who is trying to remain a guy although the inner voice of Be A Man is palpable and reverberating inside.  His nonchalant, casual way of speaking and his slow burns are priceless (he finally takes out his frustrations on Laura's new beau, the unctious sensitive pony-tailed Ian played by Cusack's best bud and former co-star of `The Sure Thing' and the cult classic `Tapeheads', Robbins, in the film's funniest fantasy sequence of Rob, Barry and Dick pummeling Ian to death). Cusack's constant streak of the smart alecky good guy continues from the quintessential portrait of Lloyd Dobler, kickboxing student of the affairs of the heart in the classic `Say Anything.' and the previous purveyor of romantic comedy, Walter `Gib' Gibson in the update of `It Happened One Night', `The Sure Thing' to his hit-man Martin Blank pondering his high school reunion with dread in the black comedy  `Grosse Pointe Blank' (reunited here with his screenwriters/partners in crime D.V. De Vincentis, Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg).\n\nThe women portraying Rob's Girlfriends of Christmas Past , so to speak, are exemplery especially Taylor (another Cusack repertoire player, who played his best gal pal/voice of reason in `Anything.') as Sarah the rebound fling and Zeta-Jones as Charlie (showing some nice moments of sublime sardonicism), the sexy babe completely out of his element). Bonet has a few nice moments as local singer Marie De Salle who provides some unsubtle ways of bringing Rob to his senses.  Sister Joan provides some comic bile as well as mutual friend to Laura and Rob. But frankly it's a guy's flick and thanks to the boisterous Black (late of HBO's comedy series `Tenacious D' and a score of films as diverse as `Mars Attacks!' and last year's co-starring with Cusack in  `Cradle Will Rock') and geeky, quiet Louiso adding some color especially in their scenes together debating their varied choices of musical tastes.\n\nDirected by Stephen Frears, a fellow Englishman who appears to know the American arcana striking a responsive chord (he put Cusack through the paces in the neo-noir classic `The Grifters' a decade ago) allows his characters time to pace themselves from one setup to the next and skillfully keeps the smart patter gleaned from the book alive on screen.\n\nEasily one of the year's funniest films and finally  a film I whole heartedly recommend in what seemed to be dearth of mediocrity thus far in the new millennium.  To paraphrase the emergence of Bruce Springsteen (who has a funny cameo) into rock's pantheon I will allude this to comedy: I have seen the future and it is John Cusack.  Rock On!"},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":174690,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.5},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama","Music"],"datePublished":"2000-03-31","keywords":"two word title,breaking the fourth wall,talking to the camera,record store,employer employee relationship","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"'High Fidelity' !?!?!

Rob asks at the very beginning of the film and it is here that Rob decides to investigate just how he is at fault to the 5 all time greatest break ups in his love life a la The Top 5s he and his co-horts in crime habitually categorize all things pertinent to music.  What follows is a laugh-filled introspection of the heart on its sleeve and its tongue sharply in cheek as to Rob's quest of finding all his faults and foibles in hope of wooing back his recent romantic dismissal that includes 5 prototypes of all heterosexual men: The First Kiss/Crush; The Adolescent Urgency/Loss of Virginity, The Woman Out of His League; The Rebound Best Friend/Possible Soul Mate and finally, The One True Love He Isn't Even Aware Of.\n\nThe approach may seem old hat and gimmicky (Cusack breaking the fourth wall and speaking directly into the camera) yet it isn't intrusive but enlightening into what the hero is really thinking and more importantly why.  Surrounded by a truly winning cast, Cusack shines once again as a likable average guy who is trying to remain a guy although the inner voice of Be A Man is palpable and reverberating inside.  His nonchalant, casual way of speaking and his slow burns are priceless (he finally takes out his frustrations on Laura's new beau, the unctious sensitive pony-tailed Ian played by Cusack's best bud and former co-star of `The Sure Thing' and the cult classic `Tapeheads', Robbins, in the film's funniest fantasy sequence of Rob, Barry and Dick pummeling Ian to death). Cusack's constant streak of the smart alecky good guy continues from the quintessential portrait of Lloyd Dobler, kickboxing student of the affairs of the heart in the classic `Say Anything.' and the previous purveyor of romantic comedy, Walter `Gib' Gibson in the update of `It Happened One Night', `The Sure Thing' to his hit-man Martin Blank pondering his high school reunion with dread in the black comedy  `Grosse Pointe Blank' (reunited here with his screenwriters/partners in crime D.V. De Vincentis, Steve Pink and Scott Rosenberg).\n\nThe women portraying Rob's Girlfriends of Christmas Past , so to speak, are exemplery especially Taylor (another Cusack repertoire player, who played his best gal pal/voice of reason in `Anything.') as Sarah the rebound fling and Zeta-Jones as Charlie (showing some nice moments of sublime sardonicism), the sexy babe completely out of his element). Bonet has a few nice moments as local singer Marie De Salle who provides some unsubtle ways of bringing Rob to his senses.  Sister Joan provides some comic bile as well as mutual friend to Laura and Rob. But frankly it's a guy's flick and thanks to the boisterous Black (late of HBO's comedy series `Tenacious D' and a score of films as diverse as `Mars Attacks!' and last year's co-starring with Cusack in  `Cradle Will Rock') and geeky, quiet Louiso adding some color especially in their scenes together debating their varied choices of musical tastes.\n\nDirected by Stephen Frears, a fellow Englishman who appears to know the American arcana striking a responsive chord (he put Cusack through the paces in the neo-noir classic `The Grifters' a decade ago) allows his characters time to pace themselves from one setup to the next and skillfully keeps the smart patter gleaned from the book alive on screen.\n\nEasily one of the year's funniest films and finally  a film I whole heartedly recommend in what seemed to be dearth of mediocrity thus far in the new millennium.  To paraphrase the emergence of Bruce Springsteen (who has a funny cameo) into rock's pantheon I will allude this to comedy: I have seen the future and it is John Cusack.

Let's start with the easy stuff. There are way too many references and bad puns. Some reviewers would call these references "jokes the adults can understand", and while that is true, they aren't funny. They're just kind of there. They are references that exist for you to say "I get that". There is no "ha" preceding that. Yes, the original also had references and bad puns, but they were used well and there weren't nearly as many. The first LEGO movie was very self aware, but it had a soul that really seemed to care about what it was saying. The second LEGO movie was so self aware that it was very difficult to take seriously. There was an obvious message about how growing up should be about learning to work with different people, but it kind of fell flat beneath the veil of "play with others even if you don't like how they play". It honestly made me a little angry. Maybe it wasn't intentional, but the film seemed to suggest that traditionally masculine things are incapable of being imaginative. I couldn't help but feel a pinch of modern social politics biting for my throat. The first film felt very apolitical, and I believe that's fitting for a film about a franchise of toys that cradled our imaginations before we cared about politics. This film certainly didn't "ruin my childhood" by any means, but it was a disappointment.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60966,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-02-07","keywords":"lego,sequel,queen,spaceship,vampire","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2788407833","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It's been five years since everything was awesome and the citizens are facing a huge new threat: LEGO DUPLO invaders from outer space, wrecking everything faster than they can rebuild.

Let's start with the easy stuff. There are way too many references and bad puns. Some reviewers would call these references "jokes the adults can understand", and while that is true, they aren't funny. They're just kind of there. They are references that exist for you to say "I get that". There is no "ha" preceding that. Yes, the original also had references and bad puns, but they were used well and there weren't nearly as many. The first LEGO movie was very self aware, but it had a soul that really seemed to care about what it was saying. The second LEGO movie was so self aware that it was very difficult to take seriously. There was an obvious message about how growing up should be about learning to work with different people, but it kind of fell flat beneath the veil of "play with others even if you don't like how they play". It honestly made me a little angry. Maybe it wasn't intentional, but the film seemed to suggest that traditionally masculine things are incapable of being imaginative. I couldn't help but feel a pinch of modern social politics biting for my throat. The first film felt very apolitical, and I believe that's fitting for a film about a franchise of toys that cradled our imaginations before we cared about politics. This film certainly didn't "ruin my childhood" by any means, but it was a disappointment.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":60966,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Adventure","Comedy"],"datePublished":"2019-02-07","keywords":"lego,sequel,queen,spaceship,vampire","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"International Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2788407833","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZmE3ZmYwNTgtNTBmOC00NGU1LWJjNzktOTVhMjEzODFmOGFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXdhZHppdGE@._V1_.jpg","description":"It's been five years since everything was awesome and the citizens are facing a huge new threat: LEGO DUPLO invaders from outer space, wrecking everything faster than they can rebuild.

While the heirs of Albert Broccoli, his daughter Barbara and son-in-law Michael G. Wilson, have done a remarkable job in keeping the series 'fresh', if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication, the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing 'touch' with James Bond, and his world.\n\nAfter an astonishing pre-title sequence, climaxing with Bond being captured by the North Koreans, the film offers a horrendous montage of torture, with Bond only surviving due to a timely prisoner exchange (with an unsympathetic M remarking, "If it had been up to me, you'd have stayed in North Korea...", obviously forgetting that 007 had saved her life in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH). Pierce Brosnan, at fifty, is superb in this sequence, vulnerable yet defiant, and to this point, DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the makings of a first-class Bond entry.\n\nThen Bond jaunts off to find the agent who betrayed him, becoming involved in an investigation involving diamonds, solar power, and a 'too-good-to-be-true' industrialist (smarmy Toby Stephens), and all of the creativity of the opening is lost, with the film becoming an uneasy mix of references to past films and silly, unbelievable situations, sets and gadgets (culminating with an 'Ice Palace' and an 'invisible' Aston Martin).\n\nAs she had won an Oscar prior to filming DIE ANOTHER DAY, sexy Halle Berry, 36, was publicized extensively as Bond's latest leading lady, CIA agent 'Jinx'. Unfortunately, after a spectacular 'rising from the waves' introduction (borrowed from Ursula Andress, in DR. NO), and a few nicely choreographed fights, she spoke...and lost all of her credibility in the role. While much of the problem was certainly in the script, she was never believable as Bond's 'counterpart' in the American intelligence community.

While the heirs of Albert Broccoli, his daughter Barbara and son-in-law Michael G. Wilson, have done a remarkable job in keeping the series 'fresh', if DIE ANOTHER DAY is any indication, the creative forces surrounding them seem to be losing 'touch' with James Bond, and his world.\n\nAfter an astonishing pre-title sequence, climaxing with Bond being captured by the North Koreans, the film offers a horrendous montage of torture, with Bond only surviving due to a timely prisoner exchange (with an unsympathetic M remarking, "If it had been up to me, you'd have stayed in North Korea...", obviously forgetting that 007 had saved her life in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH). Pierce Brosnan, at fifty, is superb in this sequence, vulnerable yet defiant, and to this point, DIE ANOTHER DAY has all the makings of a first-class Bond entry.\n\nThen Bond jaunts off to find the agent who betrayed him, becoming involved in an investigation involving diamonds, solar power, and a 'too-good-to-be-true' industrialist (smarmy Toby Stephens), and all of the creativity of the opening is lost, with the film becoming an uneasy mix of references to past films and silly, unbelievable situations, sets and gadgets (culminating with an 'Ice Palace' and an 'invisible' Aston Martin).\n\nAs she had won an Oscar prior to filming DIE ANOTHER DAY, sexy Halle Berry, 36, was publicized extensively as Bond's latest leading lady, CIA agent 'Jinx'. Unfortunately, after a spectacular 'rising from the waves' introduction (borrowed from Ursula Andress, in DR. NO), and a few nicely choreographed fights, she spoke...and lost all of her credibility in the role. While much of the problem was certainly in the script, she was never believable as Bond's 'counterpart' in the American intelligence community. On the other hand, Rosamund Pike, 23, was both sexy and duplicitous as British double agent Miranda Frost, as chilly as her name, but capable of igniting under 007's gaze. In a part equally poorly written, she made far more of her scenes than the writers gave her. \n\nThe most interesting character in the film was certainly Rick Yune, as Graves' 'enforcer', Zao. Charismatic, ruthless, and nearly unstoppable, Zao was nearly a primal force, far more menacing than Graves at his worst.\n\nWhile a sword-fight sequence between Bond and Graves provided a rare film highlight, and certainly ranks as one of the film series' more memorable sequences, much of the rest of the production was silly, with the story set at a break-neck pace to 'hide' the absurdities.

First time director Joe Wright has worked with television playwright Deborah Moggach's script and a wonderful collection of mainly British actors to delight us. The versatile camera-work, luscious countryside, grand settings, period costumes, and atmospheric music are evidence of a work on which much love has been lavished.\n\nAt the heart of this triumph is the delightful 20 year old Keira Knightley as the assured and sharp Elizabeth Bennett, the second of five daughters looking to be married off by an anxious mother. Knightley's rise in the thespian firmament has been meteoric and this is her best performance to date in a role for which she is perfectly cast.

First time director Joe Wright has worked with television playwright Deborah Moggach's script and a wonderful collection of mainly British actors to delight us. The versatile camera-work, luscious countryside, grand settings, period costumes, and atmospheric music are evidence of a work on which much love has been lavished.\n\nAt the heart of this triumph is the delightful 20 year old Keira Knightley as the assured and sharp Elizabeth Bennett, the second of five daughters looking to be married off by an anxious mother. Knightley's rise in the thespian firmament has been meteoric and this is her best performance to date in a role for which she is perfectly cast. Matthew MacFadyen is suitably brooding and gauche as Mr Darcy, but the cast list is enlivened with splendid British character actors, including Brenda Blethyn as Lizzie's irascible mother, Tom Hollander as a diminutive cleric seeking a wife, and Judi Dench as the formidable Lady Catherine, plus the Canadian Donald Sutherland (Lizzie's wise father).\n\nThis is a Georgian world in which social conventions present a veritable minefield for indiscretions or misunderstandings and in which a formal dance can be as intricate an occasion as international diplomacy.

That is my two cents, hope you enjoy as much as we have.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":359208,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Drama","Music","Romance"],"datePublished":"2018-10-05","keywords":"alcoholism,tinnitus,rising star,singer songwriter,singer","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Official Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi94288665","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMmMxMDRlNGMtMDQzOC00NjVlLWFhOTktMzA1Y2I3Yjc2MjFiXkEyXkFqcGdeQWtlbGFyc2Vu._V1_.jpg","description":"A movie star helps a young singer and actress find fame, even as age and alcoholism send his own career into a downward spiral.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3078932/","name":"Lady Gaga","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000385/","name":"Sam Elliott"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0456097/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0605792/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007143/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0744839/","name":"Eric Roth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0177896/","name":"Bradley Cooper","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3391497/","name":"Will Fetters"],"duration":"PT2H16M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The movie's theme portrays a good overall message of staying loyal with your family and the responsibilities of raising one. The movie had many jokes which made the entire theater roar with laughter! Some jokes were overused, but still made it very funny! Will Arnett playing Batman is a very good choice! \n\nWill Arnett (Batman) works alone as a hero, however trying to hide is own identity as the richest man alive, Bruce Wayne. The movie has all the vilians, like, Bane, Poison Ivy, and much more! The Joker has evil plans set for the entire city. The Joke however has one mission the entire film, make Batman admit he is his favorite enemy. The sarcasm and joke of this is kinda repetitive and doesn't make sense at some times.\n\nOverall, this movie is great and a must watch!

The movie's theme portrays a good overall message of staying loyal with your family and the responsibilities of raising one. The movie had many jokes which made the entire theater roar with laughter! Some jokes were overused, but still made it very funny! Will Arnett playing Batman is a very good choice! \n\nWill Arnett (Batman) works alone as a hero, however trying to hide is own identity as the richest man alive, Bruce Wayne. The movie has all the vilians, like, Bane, Poison Ivy, and much more! The Joker has evil plans set for the entire city. The Joke however has one mission the entire film, make Batman admit he is his favorite enemy. The sarcasm and joke of this is kinda repetitive and doesn't make sense at some times.\n\nOverall, this movie is great and a must watch! Fun for the entire family, no matter what age or gender!","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":139206,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.3,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Animation","Action","Adventure"],"datePublished":"2017-02-09","keywords":"lego,batmobile,dc comics,based on comic book,batman character","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Extended TV Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi466269721","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTY0NTAyMDA5NV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODM2NzM4MDI@._V1_.jpg","description":"There are big changes brewing in Gotham, and if Batman wants to save the city from the Joker's hostile takeover, he may have to drop the lone vigilante thing, try to work with others, and maybe learn to lighten up.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0004715/","name":"Will Arnett","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0148418/","name":"Michael Cera","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0206257/","name":"Rosario Dawson"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003021/","name":"Chris McKay"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005154/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0283444/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0602537/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0334381/","name":"Seth Grahame-Smith","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0571344/","name":"Chris McKenna","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1273099/","name":"Erik Sommers"],"duration":"PT1H44M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Passionate stuff indeed.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":275936,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8,"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Drama","Romance"],"datePublished":"2006-05-10","keywords":"pride and prejudice,england,gentleman,bachelor,prejudice","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Pride &amp; Prejudice","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3045130521","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOTY1MDktM2IxMy00MTA4LWI4NjEtNWM1ZjNmMWJmMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjAwOTY1MDktM2IxMy00MTA4LWI4NjEtNWM1ZjNmMWJmMzkxXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Focus Features","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0461136/","name":"Keira Knightley","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0532193/","name":"Matthew Macfadyen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000950/","name":"Brenda Blethyn"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0942504/","name":"Joe Wright"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0042399/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0005073/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047476/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0595738/","name":"Deborah Moggach","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000807/","name":"Jane Austen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000668/","name":"Emma Thompson"],"duration":"PT2H9M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

They nestle in deep ruts worn into the stone paving blocks of a roadway entering a gated city.  The cart rumbles on, its wheels fitting perfectly into the grooves worn by unspoken centuries of just such passing wagons...in one image we see how tradition creates its own paths, how contemporary reality is fabricated to fit such traditions...  The camera rises, we see an almost impossible panorama of Peking, the Forbidden City spreading out before us like an Oz extending to the horizon.\n\nWhat a film this is:  a superb action adventure romance with terrific acting and a much-welcome heart underlying the technical superiority.\n\n"Crouching Tiger...", I am told, is representative of a specific literary/cinematic genre in China: Wu Xia...the wizard/warrior piece...magic and martial arts blended.  I'm not familiar with the form, but the world portrayed here is a breathtakingly fantastical one.  The story is putatively set in 19th century China, but it could be anywhere, anywhen.  It is a place of high honor and deep feelings, a place where people are bound by traditions and held captive by their forms.  It is also a place of wild and mythic landscapes...from stark desert (thought nowhere do we get that featureless, wide-screen linear horizon seen in David Lean's "Lawrence of Arabia!") to magic misty green mountains with deep dark lakes and steeply cascading streams that come braiding, tumbling down the rockslide heights. High, reedy bamboo forests wave, wondrous, in sighing winds.\n\nIn this world people may do amazing things.  The flying in this movie -- properly called "wire work" in film terms -- is fantastic.  This technique, of course, was not invented by the Wachowski's, but the choreographer of "Crouching Tiger...", Woo-ping Yuen, also staged the wire-fights of "Matrix."  Here, the ability of our warrior heros and villains to climb walls, to leap to the rooftops and soar from building to building -- not to mention engaging each other in aerial combat that soars from the peak of a mountain top to the rocks of a mountain stream in a single take -- or to duel on the very tips of dipping, waving bamboo trees -- looks almost plausible, just over the border of the possible, at least.   The whole packed-in audience at the big theater at the advanced screening at Pipers Alley in Chicago burst into spontaneous applause several times throughout...\n\nAt other moments, I found myself in weepy transport.  As I think of the fight in the treetops, right now, I become drippy -- tingly of eye and sinus.\n\nApart from all else, this is grand storytelling!  It has passion, love, revenge...it expresses deep need and longing.\n\nAnd, yes, the woman are the action hearts of the film!  Michelle Yeoh is wonderful...but I've been in love with her for years.  Here, she is more mature, quieter, wiser than in any role I've seen her in.  Her performance is strong and moving, her face registering, magically, a range of conflicting emotions, hidden secrets, crouching angers, all at once.  In acting training we were always told you can't do that.  She does it.\n\nChow Yun Fat, too...I've been a fan of his since I first discovered John Woo's Hong Kong crime thrillers...is the best I've ever seen, as well...magnificent in his silences.  Strength without cruelty.\n\nThe center of the film is a girl who looks to be about 15!  Ziyi Zhang whose date of birth is given as 1979.  Zhang is from Beijing, China, and has only one other film credit.  She is remarkable. Her story is the film's binding element.  And this newcomer holds it together!  Holding her own with Yeoh and Chow in both dramatic material and in the balletic martial pas des dieux's  that frame the conflicts between characters.  She is the "Luke Skywalker" of the piece, if you will...though "Crouching Tiger..." has everything the "Star Wars" saga aspires to: excitement, thrills and magic. Here however, technical fireworks are wrapped heart and deeply resonant spirit. Elements Lukasfilm wanted to have, but which it succeeded in providing only in the most self-conscious way.\n\nBy the way: this is an action film, almost uniquely without violence...or, rather, the violence is so stylized, so removed into some mystical realm, that it almost disappears into dance.  There is, I believe, only one small splash of blood on-screen.  Typically, I don't like that -- figuring that if you're going to do a film where violence is part of it all, where action advances plot, let's have it full-bore, the "Full Peckinpaw," if you will. Here, however, this stylization works beautifully with action sequences that take the breath away and inspire a sense of awe, rather than simply leave you white-knuckled and sweaty.\n\nThere are those who will grumble that Jackie Chan (another favorite of mine) does it all for real, without wires and tricks.  True enough...  But here that exuberance of motion is in service of a grand story and strong characters who carry worthwhile emotional burdens!\n\nI won't be able to wait for the DVD, and will probably see it again, perhaps see it twice before it hits the home-market.\n\nMy recommendation: Just go see it.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":261834,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.8},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Drama"],"datePublished":"2001-03-21","keywords":"china,female martial artist,defying gravity,tragic hero,mixed martial arts","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1046455321","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BZDY1ZjQ4YzAtODZmNy00M2JhLTkwNzItNjA0NDFmZDM2MzFkXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer for Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000334/","name":"Chow Yun-Fat"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000706/","name":"Michelle Yeoh"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0955471/","name":"Ziyi Zhang"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000487/","name":"Ang Lee"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0031861/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0078389/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0041248/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0910924/","name":"Hui-Ling Wang"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0770005/","name":"James Schamus"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0874631/","name":"Kuo Jung Tsai"}],"duration":"PT2H"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Overall, it just never seemed to gel into anything substantial, as I see it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":5,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1515,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2018-09-28","keywords":"girl","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"The Padre","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi181189401","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI4NzM0OGEtY2ZhMi00MmY4LWExZGEtOWYzYWQ0MTYzZWZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNWI4NzM0OGEtY2ZhMi00MmY4LWExZGEtOWYzYWQ0MTYzZWZjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXRoaXJkLXBhcnR5LXZpZGVvLXVwZGF0ZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Official Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000619/","name":"Tim Roth","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000560/","name":"Nick Nolte","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0350079/","name":"Luis Guzmán"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1038286/","name":"Jonathan Sobol"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0133523/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0053578/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3127634/","name":"Stephen Kunc"],"duration":"PT1H38M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

A wonderful actor.\n\nWhat struck me right away was the extremely good, scored intro, the music throughout Dystopia is of I am a genuine fan of classic horror, so I was a bit suspicious when I heard VIAPLAY was doing Dystopia but boy was I surprised for a number of reasons.\n\nThe first is it kept me wondering what exactly was going on. There was just enough there to build atmosphere and tension without giving away the surprise. And it was delivered with such skill and care that it truly unfolded masterfully. You know something is wrong. You know something is up. But you can't quite figure out what it is. The Director of Dystopia is Richard Jarnhed and I need to keep an eye out for his future endeavors as he is madly talented.\n\nAnd secondly this was directed by just one director. Richard directed all 8 episodes and that's not normal in Scandinavia.\n\nAnd lastly, it gave us something new. This is possibly the best aspect because I am sick to death of cookie cutter horror movies. People nowadays have forgotten that horror doesn't just mean blood and guts. Before directors had to create tension and atmosphere by building the plot and unraveling the story slowly. It's refreshing to see this done with such care.\n\nThe acting is wonderful and directing is amazing.

The result is a pleasing fare one can really sink their teeth into and enjoy.\n\nIt has some familiar faces too, and what's best about it, is that not only do they live up to their so-called stardom, but even the unfamiliar or not-yet- "famous" actors with smaller roles, really do a great job and sell it. At no time while you are watching this movie do you feel it far-fetched or unbelievable that Kong actually exists, and isn't that, in a nutshell, what all movies should aspire to - the suspension of disbelief?

"Fencing, fighting, torture, revenge, giants, monsters, chases, escapes, true love ...". Well, in a way, that's this version of KONG, and I am really happy and surprised at just how GOOD it was.\n\nTake a bit of the original Kong, mix it with one part Private Ryan, a dash of The Deer Hunter, some Monty Python, lots of Jurassic Park, a pinch of A Space Oddity and mix well with some (insert your favorite lower-key funny movies HERE). The result is a pleasing fare one can really sink their teeth into and enjoy.\n\nIt has some familiar faces too, and what's best about it, is that not only do they live up to their so-called stardom, but even the unfamiliar or not-yet- "famous" actors with smaller roles, really do a great job and sell it. At no time while you are watching this movie do you feel it far-fetched or unbelievable that Kong actually exists, and isn't that, in a nutshell, what all movies should aspire to - the suspension of disbelief? Mission accomplished on this one, and good job to the creators.\n\nA definite must-watch.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":301537,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2017-03-08","keywords":"giant spider,monster movie,giant monster,monster versus monster,pointless self sacrifice","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"4K Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2174206745","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDM5ZWRmOGItNDYwZS00NTY1LTg5YzMtYmRhN2M5Y2I2MTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDM5ZWRmOGItNDYwZS00NTY1LTg5YzMtYmRhN2M5Y2I2MTNjXkEyXkFqcGdeQWFuaW5vc2M@._V1_.jpg","description":"","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1089991/","name":"Tom Hiddleston","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000168/","name":"Samuel L.

While Logan may not be a perfect film, it is most certainly a perfect comic book film. It is a masterpiece of the most epic proportions and leaves us with a brilliant swan song for producer and star Hugh Jackman in his final outing as Wolverine. The film, directed brilliantly by James Mangold, is a two plus hour comic book fan's wet dream as we see the version of Wolverine every fan has wanted to see for nearly two decades.

He is a borderline alcoholic suffering from a mysterious illness that limits his mutant abilities. Due to this, he lives this quiet life until he meets a young girl who he feels he must protect. Without giving too much away, there is much more here than I can go into but I will say, if you are a fan of the Wolverine comics, this film will bring a tear to your eye. This is probably the most faithful adaptation of a comic book character EVER, Marvel and DC combined. The way the story goes, the way Logan behaves, the selflessness and the rage, this is an all around realized version of this character. While it may have taken a little longer than it should have, this film was worth the wait. James Mangold does a fantastic job at creating the world Logan knows now. This is more of a film like Mangold's 3:10 to Yuma. It is bleak, violent and absolutely heartbreaking. This is far from the PG-13 character we're used to. This is a foul mouthed, miserable and very VERY bloody rendition of the source material. This is a film very much like The Guantlet or Badlands, a crime thriller and on-the-road drama. It very much embodies the look and feel of a film from the mid-70s and it plays to this very well. \n\nThe performances in this film are amazing. Hugh Jackman's performance here is the best as the character and may be one of the best of his career. He is miserable and broken in this film and to see him like this as the character, it is bittersweet especially because Jackman has been so attached to this role. If he hurts, we hurt. If he's mad, we're mad. It is a true testament to Jackman as an actor to make his audience feel this connected to someone who is, by traditional standards, completely unrelateable. Boyd Holbrook brings a sinister performance to this and continues to build a very impressive resume. Holbrook is someone who you'll love to hate. The real standout performance here is from Dafne Keen who plays Laura. Without giving away any spoilers, she is BADASS in this film and even gives Logan a run for his money on the brutality.\n\nOverall, Logan is a perfect comic book adaptation that is as heartbreaking as it is visually stunning. Mangold and Jackman create a special film with this that should be talked about for years to come. Believe the hype, Logan is a seriously amazing comic book film that just may be the best ever made and embodies the definition of a perfect adaptation.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":10}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":695874,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":8.1},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2017-03-03","keywords":"marvel comics,x men,superhero,mutant,north dakota","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Super Bowl Spot","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1946727961","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNzU3NmY1NTktOTY5NC00NzY0LTk1YzUtYzBmYWFhNDhiMDM2XkEyXkFqcGdeQW1yb3NzZXI@._V1_.jpg","description":"Watch the Super Bowl Spot for 'Logan.'"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0413168/","name":"Hugh Jackman"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001772/","name":"Patrick Stewart"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm6748436/","name":"Dafne Keen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0047120/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0420822/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0003506/","name":"James Mangold"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0291082/","name":"Scott Frank"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0338169/","name":"Michael Green"}],"duration":"PT2H17M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over.

The photography is astonishing. Astonishing. Add to that a story that never relents with suspense and emotional intensity and you have a remarkable movie.\n\nThe idea of being under constant stress, worrying for your main characters, should not be new if you know the director Alfonso Cuaron's previous major film, "Children without Men." And like that film, he works with his same cameraman, Emmanuel Lubezki, who has become a co-conspirator in his films. That's a good thing. This movie is a visual stunner. Yes, it has a lot of "effects" if you can call them that, but that have such visual coherence they remain logical and reasonable, even as they tip into the fabulous. It's an achievement.\n\nSandra Bullock is the main character here, even more than her co-lead George Clooney. And she's pretty amazing. You might think she doesn't get much room to stretch her abilities, trapped in space the whole time, but this is exactly where it shows how good she is. Even when she's talking to herself she makes it real, and moving, not a canned or cheesy sentimental or filler kind of moment. Clooney is also strong, playing the more experienced astronaut to a T, including his enduring calm in crisis.\n\nOnce you are done watching and leave the theater (or stand up from your couch) you might actually feel disoriented. Certainly in 3-D (and I saw it in the IMAX version) the effects are visceral. But looking back in the light of day you might also ask what the movie was about. Or rather, if it was about anything more than the one, relentless trajectory of surviving a series of near-death mishaps.\n\nThe answer is no. And that's a strength. It's definitely good that the writers (including the director) did not push the sentimentality too hard (there's a little). And there is no great sense of finding God or discovering your inner self. No, this is a survival film as gripping and down to earth (haha) as the vivid "Grey." No distractions here.\n\nExcept the visuals. Even in 2-D this must be something to marvel at. The 3-D was really really good, and this might seem odd to say given the theatrical mechanics of the camera and exploding spacecraft, but it's also really subtle. There are few moments (memorable ones, like Bullock's tears) where the dimensional aspects come forward. But the film basically uses the 3-D effects to enhance what is already there, nothing more. This of course, enhances a lot, but in respect to the story.\n\nThe photography is remarkable for the long takes at work, including the almost laugh- out-loud spectacular first long scene where Bullock and Clooney are doing spacewalks. The intelligence of how the camera pulls you into the scenes, with fluidity and without breaks (no edits, no cuts), is both beautiful and effective. There are even moments that are so virtuosic you wonder how they even thought they could do it, let alone then do and succeed. \n\nThe best example for me was watching Bullock spinning against the fixed starry sky, then the camera pulls closer and seamlessly starts to spin until the spinning becomes the same as Bullock's. The camera continues its approach, getting in on her helmet with reflections, and her face, and then finally her eye (yes that close), and with an incredibly deft wide angle swing we are in her head, looking out at the spinning universe, listening to her panic. Then the camera reverses and undoes all of this, step by fluid step. It takes a really long time, it happens without a single break (which means you are given no emotional escape), and it's both gorgeous and taut with terror. \n\nThere have been some questions raised about the feasibility of the various events--the different orbits of the real shuttle and space station, or the high speed of the spacewalker in a jetpack, or getting a visual on a space station 100 miles away--but you have to just let all that go. It doesn't really matter. It's not about likelihood on any level. And the movie is so accurate in so many ways it will seem very conceivable. \n\nIt's hard to imagine not liking this movie on one level or another. No, it isn't crazily imaginative like a Tarantino or Coen film, and it doesn't work its way into social or psychological significance, but what it deliberately does focus on is flawless.\n\na postscript: be sure to see the Cuaron directed parallel short film "Aningaaq" which is recently posted all over. Google it.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":795708,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.7,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Drama","Sci-Fi"],"datePublished":"2013-10-09","keywords":"space station,female protagonist,sole survivor,self sacrifice,despair","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Main Trailer","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2340006169","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTc0NDY0MjM5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMTA0NzIzMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"A medical engineer and an astronaut work together to survive after an accident leaves them adrift in space.\r\n\r\n","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000113/","name":"Sandra Bullock","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000123/","name":"George Clooney","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000438/","name":"Ed Harris"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0002663/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0164586/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0159772/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190859/","name":"Alfonso Cuarón","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0190861/","name":"Jonás Cuarón"],"duration":"PT1H31M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

The division's ability to stop murders before they happen is based on the psychic ability of three people who were mutant byproducts of a failed genetic program designed to help babies born from drug-dependent mothers. Cruise's character, John Anderton, is motivated by the loss of his own son, who was abducted and murdered six years earlier. Accordingly, he's a strong supporter of the controversial program, whose opponents feel it could potentially make an error and people might be wrongfully convicted, if not potentially rehabilitated. That action begins when Anderton is identified as a future killer, and he hits the road running. This may sound a little like The Fugitive, but in this case, you don't know if the man on the run is--or, rather, will be--guilty.\n\nBased on a short story by futurist Phillip K. Dick, author of Blade Runner, the atmosphere of a dark world with high technology having gotten out of hand, almost as though it snuck up on us without our knowing, remains the theme. To remind us that we aren't controlled by technology, but are nonetheless overrun by it, there are frequent references to current-day familiarities, such as department stores and restaurants, such as The Gap and McDonalds, where impressively entertaining high-tech mass marketing gadgets know what you've purchased before and offer new suggestions for consideration. (Sounds like a visit to amazon.com?) Spielberg lightens up the tone with his signature wit and humorous quips and visuals now and then, as opposed to Ridley Scott's more serious and consistently dark visualization portrayed in Blade Runner.\n\nAs a plotline, Minority Report is intelligent, has a good consistent flow, isn't always predictable (at least not that long before it happens), has many twists and turns with legitimate dead-ends, and above all, tells a plausible story (even if the basic premise itself requires considerable suspension of disbelief). As Anderton begins to unravel the true story about the corruption behind the pre-crime program, he is lead even further towards his destination as predicted by the `pre-cognitives' who predicted his crime. To tell any more of the story would disclose too much; besides, it isn't necessary. You know all you need to know here.\n\nThe best parts of the movie are so good  from the high-tech special effects to the light-hearted humorous moments to the good, steady flow of the action and plotline  that the problems with the film are easily forgiven. That said, my main gripe is the presumption that, in the future, anyone convicted of a crime before it happens is immediately sent to a state of suspended animation, an alternative form of the death penalty. This is obviously one of the main sources of controversy within the storyline, but anyone can see that, in almost all cases, the predicted murders were not premeditated, if not potentially accidental, in which case, psychological counseling and some form of probation would be enough. There's nothing to suggest in the film that the context is a police state, which would allow the premise to make sense. Yet, so much of the movie is based on this premise, that may be bothersome to the discerning viewer. There are many such similar oversimplifications, each of which could be quite easily solved with a minor change or a quick dialog line or two, hence a mild sense of sloppiness in direction.\n\nStill, in the end, these didn't bother me that much.

There are many such similar oversimplifications, each of which could be quite easily solved with a minor change or a quick dialog line or two, hence a mild sense of sloppiness in direction.\n\nStill, in the end, these didn't bother me that much. I still had a great time, and enjoyed it as the frivolous and wonderfully playful action/thriller it was intended to be.","aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":529331,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":7.6,"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Crime","Mystery"],"datePublished":"2002-09-18","keywords":"year 2054,future noir,neo noir,washington d.c.,psychic","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Minority Report","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi3333161241","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhMjlhYTItMzViYi00ODFiLTlhNTAtYzQyYzM5ZmM4MDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYTFhMjlhYTItMzViYi00ODFiLTlhNTAtYzQyYzM5ZmM4MDdmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000129/","name":"Tom Cruise","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0268199/","name":"Colin Farrell","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0608090/","name":"Samantha Morton"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000229/","name":"Steven Spielberg"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0000756/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0819670/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0012382/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001140/","name":"Philip K.

"Percy Vs Goliath") is a biographical drama film based on the life of Canadian farmer Percy Schmeiser. Directed by Clark Johnson ("S. W. A. T.", "The Sentinel") and starring Christopher Walken, Christina Ricci, and Zach Braff, it is a relatively routine true story picture that benefits primarily from its main star holding things together.\n\nIn 1998, in the Canadian town of Bruno, Saskatchewan, elderly farmer Percy Schmeiser (Christopher Walken) one day discovers he is being sued by the Monsanto corporation for allegedly using their enhanced GMO seeds for several years. Due to his family's limited funds, Percy cannot afford to take them on by himself and so enlists the help of young hotshot lawyer Jackson Weaver (Zach Braff) and environmental activist Rebecca Salcau (Christina Ricci) to fight a legal battle to ensure the safety of crops belonging to farmers everywhere. Because of the constant media exposure, Percy and his team gain many supporters from all over the world who motivate them to keep going in their pursuit of justice over the domineering corporate businesses.\n\nSince moving to a more rural neighbourhood many years ago, I have come to appreciate how hard farmers work to provide consumers with the best quality product they are capable of growing. Naturally, there will be various things that prove problematic along the way, such as the pressure to use GMOs or unsafe pesticides in their fruits and vegetables. In the film "Percy", we see that these factors are more serious than we may have originally thought, causing us to question the legality of corporate interference in selling harvested crops to unknowing customers. Although the film initially presents this as a locally Canadian issue, it is later established that there are corporations in other countries guilty of doing this as well. One scene in particular shows that farmers in India are suffering at the hands of big businesses bullying them into submission, which has contributed to high suicide rates among workers in that profession. It made me wonder how badly farmers have it in my own area as more than twenty years later, the issue of GMOs and pesticides are still a prevalent issue today.\n\nThere's little to say in terms of the directorial style here. Clark Johnson keeps things going at a simplistic level, intercutting between moments of Percy and co discussing legal matters with generic shots of the Saskatchewan farmland. Granted, it would be rather difficult to make subject matter like GMO seeds interesting to most audiences but for the most part he succeeds, showing that the future of a farmer's livelihood is at stake here. While I am aware this film is based on true events, I still wish it was less pedestrian in its approach to the source material. Everything felt as though it was following a typical template set by much better biographical dramas before it. As a result, I often found myself drifting in and out of my investment in the story, as I could tell right away how things were going to end due to the predictable direction that it was heading. Despite that, I was at least still curious to see how other farmers would react to the final court ruling of what Percy and his group ended up with.\n\nIt's easy to take for granted an actor like Christopher Walken, due to how prolific he is and the large amount of bizarre performances he's given in the past. Here, however, Walken demonstrates a dramatic range we often forget he's capable of, bringing a relatable sincerity to the role of Percy Schmeiser, a humble Canadian farmer who only wants what's best for the produce he grows (in this case, canola), bringing a necessary emotional centre to the film. I'm not sure how accurate his accent was, as American and Canadian accents sound almost identical to me, but I did feel he did a decent enough job convincing me that he was from North of the border. It was also nice to see Christina Ricci in a supporting role, as I consider her to be highly underrated. Ricci is one of those actresses whom I've never seen give a bad performance in anything she's in, and this film is no exception. I liked how her character remained a loyal ally to Percy, even accompanying him on international ventures to promote his cause. Zach Braff, on the other hand, wasn't featured as often as he should have been. This is a shame as I enjoyed seeing his character standing up for Percy and farmers everywhere based on his own moral principles rather than for monetary reasons. He is only prominently seen during the first and final acts of the film, which leads me to believe he was likely written in as a mere afterthought.\n\nWhile the film is nothing groundbreaking, it's still a decent enough drama to hold one's attention for its short duration of 99 minutes. It proudly wears its anti-capitalist morals on its sleeve so anyone who likes movies that try to "stick it to the man" should derive enough entertainment from something like this. As for me, I liked the acting the most, mainly from Walken and Ricci, so I hope those two will work together on something else in the future.\n\nI rate it 6.5/10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":1537,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.4},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Biography","Drama"],"datePublished":"2021-04-30","keywords":"farmer,organic farmer,cross contamination,lawsuit,courtroom","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Percy Vs Goliath Official US Trailer (2021)","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi260423705","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlZTEwZGUtNmZjYi00MjkwLThjYTMtNWU4NDg0MDk2MDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BOGJlZTEwZGUtNmZjYi00MjkwLThjYTMtNWU4NDg0MDk2MDY5XkEyXkFqcGdeQWVyZ3JlZW5l._V1_.jpg","description":""},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000686/","name":"Christopher Walken"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0561809/","name":"Roberta Maxwell"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000207/","name":"Christina Ricci"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0424800/","name":"Clark Johnson"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0293963/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0705676/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0141447/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2125366/","name":"Garfield Lindsay Miller"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0429499/","name":"Hilary Pryor"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1285700/","name":"Maureen Dorey"}],"duration":"PT1H39M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Historical documentation supports that Cole Porter's life, especially while in New York, was more integrated than a casual observer might think. On the contrary, there were many black people who attended the late Mr. Porter's, shall we say..."Night Parties". Primarily Black male prostitutes whom he patronized at the Harlem brothels he frequented. A few, even served as inspiration for some of his more popular songs. This subject, which is a key part of Cole Porter's life, is conveniently leeched out of the story.\n\nThis isn't the only bone of contention I have with this movie. Much of the movie's music is taken out of context, not only chronologically, but also stylistically and logistically. He wrote songs for key reasons at key times. For instance, the very woman who was supposed to have inspired this movie, Cole Porter's wife Linda, also was reported to have given the song "De-lovely", its name. This is referenced in many notable biographies of Cole Porter.\n\nIf you actually want to know about his real life and his REAL music, go to the library and read for yourself about the actual person.

If you're reading this, you've obviously got online access, so do yourself a huge favor, start by visiting some of the online multi-media, book and music outlets and enter his name in a search.

Its core audience is the 5- 12 crowd, and let's face facts: kids will laugh at anything! That's exactly why I've never been a big fan of family films. I'm always bound to experience the predictable quotient of gags that involve vomit, farts and kicks in the groin - all of which are in this movie. Helen Keller can see the punchlines coming a mile away. Ice Cube seems thoroughly embarrassed to be a part of this movie. I'm sure he took on the project to hopefully broaden his demographic (never having done a PG film before). The kids, like most actors their age, constantly overact. Their nonstop bickering makes you feel Ice Cube's pain of having to escort them. Cube ends up getting into every implausible disaster you can possibly imagine. It would help if the gags had even a shred of credibility. Not to mention, every time something embarrassing and disastrous happens to Cube's character, the kids laugh like hyenas, making the gags mean-spirited as well as unfunny. The only moment I remember laughing is when the kids try to drive off in Cube's minivan. He chases after them and tries to climb inside through the sunroof. The kids crash into a giant statue of a lumberjack, holding an axe. The axe then falls down and nails Cube right in his groin. Another predictable gag, but after long periods of not laughing, I had to relieve myself in some fashion. And like in all these movies, there's a schmaltzy conclusion that's supposed to deliver a "message." When I left the theater, I saw this one mother who was so fed up with her bratty son that she picked him up and spanked him, yelling out obscenities. Obviously, this message of accepting kids for who they are, no matter how bratty they get, didn't sink through her head. So why do these films even bother? When you have a movie as detached from reality as "Are We There Yet?" it's hard to deliver a message to its audience that will linger with them.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":3}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31076,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":4.7},"contentRating":"PG","genre":["Adventure","Comedy","Family"],"datePublished":"2005-05-25","keywords":"braces,fish out of water,child gagged,reference to lebron james,reference to 50 cent","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Are We There Yet?","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1991704857","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYjNmMWQ4YTMtNjQ2Zi00YmRkLWE4MmYtZjlhMzc5MTRkNGRjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Trailer"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001084/","name":"Ice Cube"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000505/","name":"Nia Long"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0020248/","name":"Aleisha Allen"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0505152/","name":"Brian Levant"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0003580/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0044714/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1027958/","name":"Steven Gary Banks"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1257282/","name":"Claudia Grazioso"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0826425/","name":"J.

"The World Is Not Enough" was a debacle of miscasting and an an endless parade of meaningless subplots and tertiary characters.  "Die Another Day" suffered from much of the same, but was also saddled with an inexplicable amount of stereo feedback and one of the oddest (if catchiest) theme songs in recent memory.  The series has been re-energized with the new entry "The Cradle Of Life," a high-spirited, far-reaching film that doesn't quite succeed but is such an improvement on the originals that you're ready to overlook all that.\n\nActually, this is a review of "Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life", the sequel to 2001's abysmally dull video-game-based film "Tomb Raider." Angelina Jolie is back as sexy, gun-toting archeologist Lara Croft, and at first glance, it's easy to mistake her for Bond, Jane Bond.  Lara is a British citizen of refined taste, highly competent in various forms of weaponry, travels around the globe to exotic locations, has friends (and lovers) in virtually every port, uses a wide variety of nifty gadgets, has an amusing yet dry form of wit, looks fabulous, and routinely saves the world from a madman bent on global domination.  She's a better 007 than Timothy Dalton in any case.\n\nThe film begins with Lara diving into a sunken temple off the coast of Greece.  While there, she is attacked by Chinese mercenaries, her support crew killed and left for dead, the mercenaries making off with a mysterious glowing orb.  Seems that mad scientist Jonathan Reiss (Ciaran Hinds) is looking for Pandora's Box, and the orb is the key to finding it.  Lara is appointed by MI:6 with stopping Reiss because opening the box would unleash an amazingly nasty plague upon the world.  Besides her support staff of Hillary (Chris Barrie) and computer expert Bryce (Noah Taylor), Lara joins forces with ex-lover Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a shifty mercenary and the only person who knows how to get to the mercenaries who stole the orb in the first place.  And of course, time is running out.\n\nJolie is excellent as Lara Croft, and there probably isn't an actress around who would be better cast in the role.  Jolie has the physicality, the look, the voice, and the attitude to pull off the role effortlessly.  She was the only redeeming factor in the first film, and she's great to watch here. The supporting cast is a mixed bag.  Hinds refrains from chewing up too much of the scenery, but he brings to mind some of the more notable Bond villains of recent times.  Butler is great to look at, but his performance is far too low-key and deadpan for a movie as bombastic as this one wants to be, especially when he's paired with Jolie, who enters each seen with a relishing look in her eyes.  Taylor again acts as a dry kind of comic relief, and he displays far more chemistry with Jolie than Butler does.\n\nOne of the biggest improvements in this film is the director.  Replacing Simon West (responsible for the monotonous "Con Air") is Jan de Bont ("Speed"), a much more competent director even if some of his films are only barley entertaining ("The Haunting").  de Bont has a knack for action on a small scale, most vividly in a gun-fight staged in a laboratory/office, but his large scale pieces, like Lara body-gliding off of one of Hong Kong's tallest buildings, lack drama.  Still, de Bont has chosen good locations and sets for the film, and there is a blessedly welcome lack of the "Matrix"-style visuals and candy-colored bombast so popular in action films of recent memory.  He is nothing if not up to task.  The film operates well within its own set of rules and physics, unlike many other films that tend to sacrifice internal logic for cheap stunts.\n\nAs much of an improvement on the first film as this is, there are still flaws.  The script, while improving ten-fold on the original, still falls flat on several occasions, sometimes held up only by Jolie's confident line readings.  At almost two hours, the film displays a desperate need for tighter scenes and a quicker pace while simultaneously leaving some scenes cut too quickly.  The movie can be very easily divided into stages, which may hold true to the spirit of the video game's levels, but often leaves the audience doing nothing more than predicting when the DVD chapter cuts will occur in six months.  Also, like the James Bond films, there is rarely any doubt that Lara will escape any dire situation she finds herself in. Like 007, we always know the hero will prevail in the end, which robs some scenes of the tension needed to excite the audience.\n\nDespite some of these flaws, "The Cradle Of Life" is a fine movie and a good way to spend 2 hours on a summer afternoon.  Jolie obviously enjoys the role, and if nothing else, the film is worth it for that alone.  Here's hoping the third entry into the series is even better than the this one. 7 out of 10.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":135760,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":5.6},"contentRating":"PG-13","genre":["Action","Adventure","Fantasy"],"datePublished":"2003-09-24","keywords":"archeologist,based on video game,sequel,altered version of studio logo,eight word title","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Lara Croft Tomb Raider Two: The Cradle of Life","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi143786265","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5YWJlNjMtNzNjNC00YjZmLWEwMDQtNDBhMmZjYWRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMDg5YWJlNjMtNzNjNC00YjZmLWEwMDQtNDBhMmZjYWRmMjBiXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0001401/","name":"Angelina Jolie"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0124930/","name":"Gerard Butler"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0057368/","name":"Chris Barrie"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000957/","name":"Jan de Bont"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0007500/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0043107/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1212988/","name":"Dean Georgaris"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0211823/","name":"Steven E. de Souza"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0366337/","name":"James V.

A year later I had almost forgot about it until I started seeing commercials on TV and I got my hopes high. To be honest, this is probably the first movie that met my expectations.\n\nI didn't go in expecting the greatest movie ever, I mean it does have Marky Mark in it and I'd hate to think he's be the start of my favorite movie of all time. But I did expect it to be exciting, emotional, and engaging... And it was.\n\nOne of the things this movie does best is show the love and commitment between the brothers.

The emotions between the brothers also led to many very funny comic moments, which I did not expect to see as many as I did. I laughed many times.\n\nSingleton is probably a better write than director, but he does a decent job through out. Most of the film is simple camera angles and what not, but there were a few moments, specifically a car chase, that was shot really well. It was all done in a manor that kept it realistic while keeping it interesting. It should also be noted that this movie had the SECOND most intense shoot out I've ever seen in a movie. Second only to, of course, the LA streets shoot out in Heat which, in my opinion, is the most intense 15 minutes ever filmed.\n\nActing was decent. Like mentioned before, the chemistry between the brothers was great, but there were many simple one-liners and Mark Wahlberg seems to play the same character way too often. Not really acting so much as reading lines in a tough way.\n\nWhile this isn't the #1 movie of the year it definitely met my expectations and is a very, very good summer action flick of not more.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":141064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-11-16","keywords":"corrupt police,death of brother,death of mother,murder,funeral","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Four Brothers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1135083801","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZhYjI4MzAtNjJiMi00ODQ4LTkwOGEtNThhNmRlNDI3MzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZhYjI4MzAtNjJiMi00ODQ4LTkwOGEtNThhNmRlNDI3MzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment"},"actor":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0879085/","name":"Tyrese Gibson"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0071275/","name":"André 3000"}],"director":[{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005436/","name":"John Singleton"}],"creator":[{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117723/"},{"@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332238/"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254213/","name":"David Elliot"},{"@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1749087/","name":"Paul Lovett"}],"duration":"PT1H49M"}&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent="</desc>

Not really acting so much as reading lines in a tough way.\n\nWhile this isn't the #1 movie of the year it definitely met my expectations and is a very, very good summer action flick of not more.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":141064,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.8,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Action","Crime","Drama"],"datePublished":"2005-11-16","keywords":"corrupt police,death of brother,death of mother,murder,funeral","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Four Brothers","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi1135083801","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZhYjI4MzAtNjJiMi00ODQ4LTkwOGEtNThhNmRlNDI3MzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmZhYjI4MzAtNjJiMi00ODQ4LTkwOGEtNThhNmRlNDI3MzFlXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNzU1NzE3NTg@._V1_.jpg","description":"Home Video Trailer from Paramount Home Entertainment","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0000242/","name":"Mark Wahlberg","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0879085/","name":"Tyrese Gibson","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0071275/","name":"André 3000"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0005436/","name":"John Singleton"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0117723/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0332238/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0254213/","name":"David Elliot","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1749087/","name":"Paul Lovett"],"duration":"PT1H49M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

It points out a generation gap between adults and children as the title suggest. For the most part he's suggesting we have a problem, He maybe right, but Ironically the format of the film with displaying text and websites on the screen which is starting to become common in movies, only adjust us to the problem versus resolving it. \n\nBut the movie is not fully negative as it does point how being able to communicate easier with one another is helpful. \n\nOverall I like the movie. It has a great ensemble cast with the likes of Adam Sandler proving he can do drama. The small stories blended together well, but I must admit the filmmaker was trying to show us a bigger picture which I did not get. \n\nIt was humorous and it's the type of film that makes you think. worth sitting through.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}},"aggregateRating":{"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31791,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7},"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-17","keywords":"sex scene,oral sex,black panties,masturbation,teenage girl","trailer":{"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2494279449","thumbnail":{"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0ODkxMDI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDczOTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg"},"thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0ODkxMDI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDczOTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Men, Women and Children follows the story of a group of high school teenagers and their parents as they attempt to navigate the many ways the internet has changed their relationships, their communication, their self-image, and their love lives.

It points out a generation gap between adults and children as the title suggest. For the most part he's suggesting we have a problem, He maybe right, but Ironically the format of the film with displaying text and websites on the screen which is starting to become common in movies, only adjust us to the problem versus resolving it. \n\nBut the movie is not fully negative as it does point how being able to communicate easier with one another is helpful. \n\nOverall I like the movie. It has a great ensemble cast with the likes of Adam Sandler proving he can do drama. The small stories blended together well, but I must admit the filmmaker was trying to show us a bigger picture which I did not get. \n\nIt was humorous and it's the type of film that makes you think. worth sitting through.","reviewRating":"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7,"aggregateRating":"@type":"AggregateRating","ratingCount":31791,"bestRating":10,"worstRating":1,"ratingValue":6.7,"contentRating":"R","genre":["Comedy","Drama"],"datePublished":"2014-10-17","keywords":"sex scene,oral sex,black panties,masturbation,teenage girl","trailer":"@type":"VideoObject","name":"Trailer #2","embedUrl":"/video/imdb/vi2494279449","thumbnail":"@type":"ImageObject","contentUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0ODkxMDI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDczOTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","thumbnailUrl":"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTQ0ODkxMDI5MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwNDczOTIyMzE@._V1_.jpg","description":"Men, Women and Children follows the story of a group of high school teenagers and their parents as they attempt to navigate the many ways the internet has changed their relationships, their communication, their self-image, and their love lives. The film attempts to stare down social issues such as video game culture, anorexia, infidelity, fame hunting, and the proliferation of illicit material on the internet. As each character and each relationship is tested, we are shown the variety of roads people choose - some tragic, some hopeful - as it becomes clear that no one is immune to this enormous social change that has come through our phones, our tablets, and our computers.","actor":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm3239803/","name":"Kaitlyn Dever","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm1679669/","name":"Rosemarie DeWitt","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm5052065/","name":"Ansel Elgort"],"director":["@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718646/","name":"Jason Reitman"],"creator":["@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0023400/","@type":"Organization","url":"/company/co0280848/","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm2226753/","name":"Chad Kultgen","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0718646/","name":"Jason Reitman","@type":"Person","url":"/name/nm0933379/","name":"Erin Cressida Wilson"],"duration":"PT1H59M"&lt;/script&gt;&lt;metacontent=" </review>

Jamie Foxx is Max, a Los Angeles cab driver with dreams of his own limo company, "Island Limo". After twelve years on the job he has become quite gifted at discerning the most intimate details of his passengers' lives... just a glance at their clothes, and he knows.\n\nHis worldly insight manages to tear down the defenses of one of his passengers, a State Attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith, who graces him with her phone number. Max hasn't even begun to revel in the pleasure of possessing the beautiful attorney's digits when he gets his next passenger, Tom Cruise as Vincent, a slick hit-man in town for a night of killing.\n\nWhen a body drops out of a fourth story window and onto Max's cab, he becomes an unwilling partner on Vincent's murder spree.

Jamie Foxx is Max, a Los Angeles cab driver with dreams of his own limo company, "Island Limo". After twelve years on the job he has become quite gifted at discerning the most intimate details of his passengers' lives... just a glance at their clothes, and he knows.\n\nHis worldly insight manages to tear down the defenses of one of his passengers, a State Attorney played by Jada Pinkett Smith, who graces him with her phone number. Max hasn't even begun to revel in the pleasure of possessing the beautiful attorney's digits when he gets his next passenger, Tom Cruise as Vincent, a slick hit-man in town for a night of killing.\n\nWhen a body drops out of a fourth story window and onto Max's cab, he becomes an unwilling partner on Vincent's murder spree.
